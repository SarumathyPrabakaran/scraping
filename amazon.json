And for just as long, have always set the can in the sink of medium hot water to warm up the cream before shaving. Never had one explode yet! My last order (from a different vendor) were different in the fact that there were no foil/paper labels on the cans, the labels were directly printed on the metallic cans and I never had to worry about the labels peeling off in the hot water. I noticed that this set of shaving cream have the foil/paper labels, so I suspect they are going to peel after a couple of uses, but no big deal. Just wish there would have been a way to know this before ordering.", "I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel. I didn't know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too. Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!). I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I've used in the past. However, as other reviewers have noted, it's not as \"rich\" or full-bodied when it comes out of the can. The 'instructions' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams). Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it's good foam, and I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the 'watery' consistency when it comes out of the can. This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).\n\nIn summary:\n* If you like foam, you may like this one. 3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.\n* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won't like it. However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you'd like it.", "I've been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I'm out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren't even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number people you have.\n\nIn terms of the cream itself, I'm a big fan of foam over gel as you don't have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette's is good at all that. I don't have sensitive skin, but I've always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.\n\nEverything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).", "Nice value for the dollar.\nNot sure what \"sheerness\" and \"thickness\" have to do with shaving cream so I can't \"rate\" them.\nI've used this cream exclusively for some time and it works well.", "This is a great shaving cream foam.

It is like getting almost three FREE cans with a three can purchase. Shelf life is not a problem either if kept in a cool place. No, the garage is a bad idea as is over the stove or on the mantle above the fireplace. This is a good deal.", "I wasn't able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value. I haven't experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it's perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use. Take note, this is a foam, not a gel, and it comes out all foam. I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation. Not much you can say...it's shaving foam. It is what it is.", "I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular. Then recently, by accident, I picked one of these Gillete foam styles off the store shelf. Because I didn't realize my mistake until a couple of weeks later, I decided to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I'm speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.", "The can looked like the one he likes however it wasn't the gel he thought it would be.

I was bullied in school for my large pit-stains, and would always have wet circles under my pits, regardless of the temperature outside. I went through several prescriptions from my doctor, which only irritated my skin and made it itch and burn like fire, preventing me from sleep. I received a sample of this product through a female care sample pack through a clinic, and fell in love. I have now been using this deodorant for almost 10 years, and have never been happier with a deodorant. Yes, I still do sweat if it's really hot out, or while working, but that's to be given with any deodorant I believe. Applying this product at night and in the morning has solved the huge wet circles I was always embarrassed of.\n\nAlso, this product smells fantastic, and has not irritated my skin even after applying twice daily.

I only roll it up one \"click\" and put it on; you don't need much. But, my complaint is how darn hard it is to turn that dial, If you have hand issues, this may not be for you. I do not like smells in my products, but bought this because people said the smell was light and i either couldn't find or didn't want the fragrance free one (cannot remember now). The fragrance is not bad. It is lighter than many and doesn't smell for long. That said, if you are sensitive to fragrance, it is noticeable when you put it on.\n\nHave no idea how long it will last - given it's price, I hope longer than the last kind I used.", "Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out. This deodorant, seriously changed my whole life. I have always been a sweaty armpit person (not a smelly sweaty, but constant sweat), and was SO insecure about it. All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn't like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter. I put this on after showering, and don't have to reapply until my next shower, even if that is two days later. I thought maybe I grew out of the problem, but have tried over the years not using it, and a couple of times have forgotten it when I traveled, and I definitely still sweat like crazy. No other deodorant works even a little for me. This is THE ONLY one I can use with success. And it smells awesome! People sometimes ask me what perfume I'm wearing, and I tell them it's my D.O., haha. I don't like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the 'powder' scent (gag).", "Definitely one of my best and trusted tried and true, Go-Tod. Easy application, lasts longer than competitors, nice scent, and great odour protection!", "This has been my favorite deodorant for years, but now that we\u2019ve moved from the desert to a warm humid climate this is a life saver. I\u2019ve tried switching to the more natural (aluminum free) deodorants that everyone raves about, but I end up smelling and with soaked T-shirt\u2019s. Secret clinical strength never fails me, and I love the fresh light scent that doesn\u2019t overpower.

These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.\n\nI will increase two two clicks each arm day and night.

Good points:\n- The lavender scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.\n- It seems to keep me smelling fresh.\n\nI'm not giving it a higher rating because:\n- The gel is extremely sticky/tacky and stays that way all day without ever absorbing into my skin although I apply a very small amount (1-click).

I tried these hoping they would be an economical version - while they are less expensive, I find that because they are thin and hard and not so absorbant, that I am using 3x the number of towels as normal. I really did not like these towels and felt I would rather pay a little more and get a better quality towel... Sorry, but that's how I feel in regards to using these BASIC towels for home use as a replacement for paper towels.

Nevertheless, this product served its purpose as replacements for paper towels rolls and disposable table napkins.\n\nIt's now close to the end of June 2020 and we still have a lot of these paper towels left. I packed the bundles separately in plastic wrap to protect them from moisture, contamination & pests. This also made it easier to store the paper towel bundles in our kitchen cabinets, instead of leaving them inside the box that they were shipped in.", "These remind me of the paper hand towels you find in common bathroom at a small office.

You get 16 packets of paper towels so these will last a long time. Each piece is 9 inches x 9 inches, so a bit smaller than my regular paper towels, but they work fine.\n\nMy order came in 5 days during the midst of the shortages.

They reported to me that the paper towels did not hold up as well as they need, and would rip or break up faster than what they were accustomed to when we were ordering a pricier paper towel brand. So, I switched to another brand that is slightly more resistant to tearing and falling apart. However, let me say this: I used these paper towels on occasion and found them to be a nice texture, albeit slightly thin. If you don't need heavy duty paper towels, these might work for you. It just didn't work for our needs because we perform clinical services and the paper towels weren't strong enough under those circumstances. Perhaps they might work better for home use, though.", "They are soft, absorbent and a value for the money.", "I normally use Viva or Brawny but during these times found it not economical. The paper towels are very useful and sturdy. Its your normal commercial type paper towel. It is not Super absorbent, however it will absorb small amounts at a time.

It doesn't lather WHICH IS GOOD, people! It doesn't have to lather to work well! It feels very hydrating as you wash, and the smell is predominently a fresh aloe vera smell for those who have had a real aloe vera plant and used it (aside from the very light citrus undertones which dissipate quickly and are not strong because they aren't synthetic perfumes) . It does feel a little drying once your face is dry but definitely clean, and nothing a little serum or moisterizer corrects. I am 30, have never had an issue wih breakouts mainly because I let my face rest: I don't wash it every day, I don't put a ton of products on it every day. I go bare-faced as much as possible and let my pores stay unsuffocated. As a result, my face stays clear and wrinkle free so far.

I can't tell if it is brightening my face, I just like how it leaves my skin feeling, clean.", "This stuff is great for my oily skin but doesn\u2019t seem over drying where my face is completely dried up with alcohol or something. It\u2019s a slippery gel type of consistency and it melts off my foundation. It smells like straight-up, real, fresh orange peels. I\u2019ll lather and leave it on my face in the shower after my pores have opened up a bit and it will start tingling and slightly stinging but not in a bad way .. as if I can feel it settling into my pores to deep clean. I\u2019ll rinse with cooler water and my face looks brighter and a bit smoother too as if it eats a little bit of dead skin off of your face. I have very oily acne prone skin.", "I like this cleanser - it does a good job of cleaning without stripping my face dry. My skin can be sensitive, but i have never had a reaction to this. The gel consistency keeps it on my silicone scrubby pads without falling off into the shower , and it foams up just enough - dense but not extravagant and hard to rinse off.", "I\u2019ve been using this product for about 3 years now. The store I used to buy it from stopped carrying it, so I decided to start buying online. I love this for my combination oily skin. I can see the difference after using it and how my skin looks brighter after use. And it doesn\u2019t feel either oily or dry after use. Skin just feels clean. I have significantly less breakouts now. And, I\u2019m convinced the vitamin c is keeping my skin looking young as people always seem to think I look about 10 years younger than I am. This is especially important to me, because I haven\u2019t always had nice skin. I recommend this to others.

I kept trying so many different cleansers that I finally decided to try soaps I previously used when I was younger with acne. This is a pretty reliable soap for me. Prevents pimples and feels like I get a good clean. It's a tiny drying though, but I have found that's pretty typical with vitamin c cleansers or cleansers that prevent pimples. So I would rather have to moisturize than have pimples. The scent is nice. It's sweet smelling almost like a sweet cereal like fruit loops.", "I Love This Product and it is a powerhouse product.

I saw immediate results in lightened pigmentation (freckles, sun spots, left over pregnancy mask). My skin loves these products. The first time I used the toner, it felt and looked like it was burning my skin a bit so I took a wet washcloth and washed it off. However once the redness went away, my skin looked amazing! I realized that the toner is just really strong, so after that, I diluted it with water and saw less irritation, but still great results. The cleansing gel is much milder but still effective (I backed off the toner after the first time and was just using the gel alone for a few weeks). Since I now know that my skin handles the gel well, I typically scrub it into my face at the start of my shower and leave it there until I am ready for a final rinse. I follow up with the toner when I feel I need it. I have been getting so many compliments lately about how great my skin looks. I am hooked and especially love that it's mostly natural!", "I\u2019ve been using this face wash for years. I love that it cleans my face at night without over-drying it, and I love the scent. I am really scent-sensitive, but the fresh orange smell of this is lovely.

I follow this cleanser with a Retinol serum and the Avalon Organics Intense Defense moisturizer. In the mornings I use the Avalon Organics Cleansing Milk.", "Love the product but when it came it was leaking out everywhere.

I also need products that require the least amount of my effort or time.\n\nI looked long and hard for a good facial cleanser that is reasonably priced. I navigated quite a few bad products along the way, several of which were not cheap. Very few facial cleansers left my face feeling \"Clean but not stripped\".\n\nThis product does this for me - my face feels clean, refreshed but not stripped or dry after. I pair this cleanser with a very light moisturizer and this combination works really well for me. One of these bottles lasts me quite a long time.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that the bottle doesn't travel as well as I'd prefer. It's one of those that you have to turn the nozzle, pumping out the current contents of the pump, in order to lock it. And if you mess-up the first time, you get to pump out yet another squirt while you try to lock it (before packing it in your suitcase). This is the only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5.", "The scent, the texture, the way my face feels (moisturizes, not drying), the price - it all comes together in this product. It works!", "With my combination skin (some parts oily and some parts dry), I prefer a gel cleasner. I was originally introduced to Aveda's gel cleanser which is what got me started on that type. Recently I was using one from a company called Lemongrass Spa, but with it being a direct sales company it was a little pricier that I wanted. And no free shipping...and let's be honest, with Amazon Prime who wants to pay shipping anymore??? So I did a search and found this gel cleaner and decided to give it a try. So far it's working out well. I like this brand anyway, so I am happy to add more of their products to my lineup.", "After much research and considering price and ingredients I decided to order this for my severe perioral dermatitis. I am so happy with this that even though my skin has cleared up, I will continue purchasing this cleanser because it is that good! It never leaves my skin feeling irritated or stripped. The smell is nice and fresh and yes, it does a good job of removing makeup. This cleanser does foam (not like crazy) but it does foam enough to where you feel like \u201cyes I\u2019m clean!\u201d. Highly recommend", "My face doesn't get nearly as red with this face wash as it does with others. It doesn't dry out my skin, and definitely helps brighten it up some. I've been using it for weeks now and I think I'll stick to this one. My skin loves it. I'm naturally prone to acne (hormonal and excess oils), have a good amount of redness at any given time & have somewhat sensitive skin. This feels so refreshing, like my skin can breathe finally without stripping off my whole dermal layer. Like I said, my face gets a bit red with this one but then totally balanced out after a minute. It's not totally moisturizing but it doesn't dry me out either."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001FSWMM", "title": "Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Weight Gainer Protein Powder, Vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin D for Immune Support, Chocolate, 6 Pound (Packaging May Vary)", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/61dIE57qUUL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "62,843 ratings", "description": "Serious Mass is the ultimate in weight gain formulas.

I've decided to 'give back' too and not be so selfish thus, make it a habit from now. What better way to start off than with the products i've used and appreciated so much?\n\n*IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING, THIS'S JUST ABOUT MY CONCLUSION TO 1st TIME BUYERS OUT THERE* BASICALLY ;\n\n1. Be sure to workout intensely (esp. your tummy area) to prevent belly fat (cause trust me, it is real) like the plague\n2. If you find the mixture too sweet for your liking you could always dilute it with extra milk, some water, or anything other thing that works for you instead of complaining & whining about it and trying to force it down\n3. Mixing the chocolate & vanilla flavor (with milk) was something i wish i'd figured out sooner. I couldn't have asked for a better taste.\n4. If you're a hard gainer, you can be assured that this product WILL do something for you (if you take it properly and workout well it would do a whole lot more than that).\nI would know because i'm a serious hard gainer myself and wouldn't even say i 'used it that properly' at all but, in the end i did see noticeable gains and got weight gain compliments for the first time in all my life.\nI'm sure if you eat well, train really hard, and take this alongside you'd be just more than fine!\n5. It has some kind of \"very sweet after-taste\" though, which lasts for some time. (could be up to 12hrs or more) even if you keep eating things in-between or after you take this. What happens is soon as your mouth becomes empty for some time you start to \"feel the taste all over again\". I find it very annoying lol but it's the ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE with this product. I'm ok with any other thing.\n6. Remember to check with your doctor before taking this (if you have any health issues or are on medication or any other supplements).\n\nMy \"testimony\"...(if you're interested) ..\n\nI'd never gained above 5 lbs in such a short time my entire life! I weighed 42kg (92 lbs) before i started my weight gain journey in September 2014 and by the time my serious mass got finished (i visited a hospital in January 2015), checked my weight and it said \"50kg (110lbs)\"\nI'd never gone past 45kg my entire life! Even when i received those \"you've put on weight compliments\" when i was younger, highest i prolly was that time was like 43kg. Because of this i thought there was a mistake in the scales they were using at the hospital two year ago. because at that time i wasn't even taking the serious mass anymore cos it had finished about a month or so ago and i'd stopped working out for about a month or so as well.\nI actually asked the doctor \"um,are.. you really sure it's 50?..didn't it just say that because of my clothes or something?\" (and i'm someone who'd never asked a doctor \"are you sure\" ever in my life!) ... I mean i knew i gained some weight all right while i was still 'on track' with this, but then i knew i'd 'stopped my journey' and wasn't even doing anything anymore so i had definitely lost weight again. That's why i was so surprised! I mean, i had a mirror in my house and all ok?, but i guess because i was constantly looking at myself almost every hour on my gain journey i never actually realised that i had gained!\nIt really was 50kg. I had gained 7kg in 2 months!\ud83d\ude07 (A HARD-GAINER) i want to stress on that again. LOL\n\nI found it really hard to believe so i had to check again during that week with a different scale (for some weird reason i didn't have a scale at home and always had to check outside of the house) lol i really wasn't serious. I checked and got the same measurement to my uttermost surprise. I didn't believe it (still) ... but then after some time i finally got over it & accepted it.\nThat was when it hit me... \"Oh, wow..does this mean i gained even more while i was still on the serious mass?\" ..\"umm.. Huh? \" And then it hit me again... \"this is the first time i've reached 110lbs! ...omg..*my eyes filled with tears* About a year ago that was actually my dream.. to get to 110lbs, and now i'm here! What is this?? How did this even happen?\"\nWell yeah, i WAS extremely confused for a long time. Trust me on that one.\n\nWELL ABOUT WORKOUTs;\n\nI used to do normal 'home exercises' and i never even went to the gym. I had a workout routine, but because i'm severely anaemic it was always extremely difficult for me to workout properly (and the way i REALLY wanted to). So i did basically some 'soft workouts'.\nI didn't have dumbbells at the time, so all i did was basically \"no dumbbell home exercises\" or \"workouts without weight\" more like it.\nThis is why i was so surprised i gained. I realised that if i'd used weights i would've gained even more. I did squats mainly, (different types of squats) and then some donkey kicks and tummy workouts usually. I normally followed \"fitnessblender\" videos on youtube, and then some other fitnessmodels' videos that i found.\n\n*****I bought 2 chocolates 1 vanilla the first time i ordered this product (yes, it was a huge risk i took but this is just how much i believed in this product even before i tried it for myself). I fell in love with it and knew right from the times i researched about it that it was the RIGHT one for me. That was what i needed tbh, and i just knew. I don't know how but oh well, it did pay off in the end so i guess i was just very lucky*****\n\nI never really experienced any form of 'super strength' or felt 'so strong' to do my workouts or anything whenever i used this DURING workout, (and i would not blame it on this because i already had serious low energy problems from my anemic condition), and plus it even says to use it mainly as \"between meals, post-workout & before bed\" in the description (which i did, but also used it as a pre- and during-workout shake as well) so um, because of that i'm not gonna say it didn't do much or help me with my workouts at all. I used it as a pre-and during workout shake mainly because it had creatine and i thought it would help me workout better and easier (But maybe i didn't experience that much of a change in strength/performance because the creatine content is really small? idk) but then i do know it helped me in all sorts of other ways nonetheless. I RECOVERED FROM MY WORKOUTS REALLY FAST and that was an incredible one.\n\nFOR THE TASTES;\n\nTHE CHOCOLATE; wasn't bad at all when mixed with milk.\nI used non-fat milk as they recommend, but then always added some extra cup or so of full cream milk after i got my serving (to dilute it a bit). This was good, i liked better the taste it gave me when i did that, but then the downside was that it increased the amount of the shake and so was always a bit harder to push down quickly.\n\nTHE VANILLA; wasn't bad either. I actually grew more fond of that after sometime when i'd taken the 2 chocolate bags for so long. I liked the taste of that too, but again, it was also way too sweet for my liking when mixed with milk (esp the after-taste). so i'd always add some extra full cream milk/a little water to it to dilute that a bit as well after i'd reached the serving size.\nAfter a while, i started mixing both flavors together and IT WAS GOOD! (i only had a few cups of the chocolate left when i figured this out, so i couldn't do that for long, but then with the few days i did that, i never regretted)!\nI would take one cup of the chocolate flavor, one cup of the vanilla flavor, blend them together, adjust a little with some extra milk, and i'm all good!\n(I always said to myself \"why didn't i think of this earlier?!\" lol)\n\nIn general i never tried any with just water but my brother did once and from the look of things, it's clear they both taste better with milk.\nI never tried mixing either with other solid stuff like peanut butter, oats & the like because i mostly used to blend them with other liquid nutrition shakes (and they always blended well) but i'll try mixing them with dry oats and some other solid stuff this time and see. I'll be sure to leave an update later!\n\nAnyway, to continue my \"testimony\";\n\nIn the beginning i couldn't eat any solid food the rest of the day after i took this in the morning. It filled me up more than a 3 square-meal ever would have so i was always worried i was going to end up relying on that and use that as my 'sole source of nutrition' the entire time.\nGood thing was.. after a while it SERIOUSLY 'OPENED UP MY STOMACH'' and i was able to eat more than i ever could have handled on my own usually. That made me very happy indeed\nI knew it was the work of the serious mass because that was by far the most caloric supplement i was taking.\n\nThe other products i took alongside (more for medical conditions & clinical purposes)were ;\nScandishake vanilla -580 calories\nEnshake chocolate- 600 calories\n(That was probably why i gained so much but i know the serious mass contributed greatly too!)\n\nOh and, ABOUT THE BLOATING THING PEOPLE SAY..\n\nWhat i'm gonna say is it is really true. And i realised it when i experienced it myself. (I already believed and was aware from what i'd read even before i bought the items, but i guess i just didn't think it would be that serious!) lol Yeah, the bloating is SERIOUS as well.\nI had read that you have to workout insanely if you didn't want to end up putting on ONLY FAT so i was already prepared for that. *Only i wasn't as prepared as i thought i was* lol\nBut then to be honest.. with all my 'daily ab workouts' and the like.. i still did have a big tummy while on this mass gainer! lol I probably didn't workout as hard but all i know is i gained weight in the places where i wanted to gain all right, only it came with a lot of belly fat too! I didn't even care at the time though, cause at the time i was far too happy with the gains and knew i could workout later to reduce the belly fat.\nIt was only funny because i'd always been a skinny girl, and i'd never seen my tummy so big (i was actually afraid at some point that it was going to stay that way and it would never go back to the way it was! lol).\n\nI mostly felt 'bloated' and i think it's because i wasn't used to having so much calories in my body. I felt so 'heavy' and 'so pregnant' all the time because i was always so full! lol it was a struggle. But i managed to pull through it. After some time of going off my weight gain journey i got my flat tummy back! :) I know what to do this time if i started my journey again so i doubt that would happen anymore! I will train harder than i did last time so i'm very well prepared i must say. So should you! \ud83d\ude0a\nI would say it was fun though! The whole experience was fun and exciting as i'd never had that much CHALLENGE thrown at... well my body..ever! I was new to working out and all these mass gainers and the like. I gradually grew from there over time.. and now i know so much more than i didn't (two years ago) about mass gainers, workout routines and the like.\n\nI'm still attached to serious mass (yes of course, the love is still there!) and i would keep on buying until i've reached the goal i've always wanted to reach. (which is around 60kg or 132 lbs. I weigh 40kg now, that's about 88lbs yeah, unfortunately.. i lost all that weight in the course of just 1 year and i'm 21 now (which means very much underweight since i'm only 5'3) which is why i'm getting myself more bags of this product)!\n\nFunny thing's, i'm not even in the United States or Canada or the UK. I'm not in a country where i could easily get this product when and if i want. But then i still manage, and do all i can to get it every time (If i told you how much trouble i go through and how much money it costs me every time, you would marvel!)\nThe number of things i could buy with the amount i spend just trying to get 2 bags of serious mass down to where i am... it's ridiculous but oh well, when something's worth it you're never really bothered so this should tell you just how much useful this product is!\nThose of you who can just order it and get it the next day or two (and at this price with no other extra costs), be very lucky and make good use of it.\n\n(I'm not getting anything for this review just so you know, i do not know the company or haven't had any agreements to do this with whatsoever. I took time & wrote this review wholeheartedly just so future buyers would know what a great product this is just in case they were having any doubts) \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFor hard gainers... i'll DEFINITELY recommend!", "I gained 15-20 pounds in a month. No signs of slowing down. I am male, 5\u201910\u201d and have floated around 160-165 pounds for years because of a fast metabolism and an inconsistent appetite.\n\nThat weight gain came after using about one bag of protein powder + regular meals. I use one serving (2 scoops) per day (with a few missed days bc\u2026life), but I use very scant scoops (helps it lasts longer). I *highly* recommend using a blender to mix this thoroughly. I use my simple Nutri Ninja Pro. When you\u2019re done blending, pour the shake in a cup and clean the blender immediately every time to make your life easier tomorrow. It\u2019s much tastier blended with ice (about 1/2 cup) to dissipate the sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s also more refreshing with little pockets of cold. I use whole milk instead of water, about 3/4 cup. Blend in more milk until the consistency is acceptable to you, like a milkshake rather than like pudding (eck).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a heavy drink and sometimes makes it difficult to eat other food, so I usually try to drink just 1/2 in the morning, stick the rest in the fridge, and drink 1/2 at night.\n\n~~\n\nI\u2019m noticing full body gains, but most prominently in my legs (thighs and glutes) and arms. It seems to be mostly muscle. I highly recommend adopting a regular exercise routine, including weights, for the best results with this. I think working out helps ensure your gains are in line with the physique you want, if you have physique goals.\n\nI started doing StrongLifts 5x5, which only requires 3 workouts per week. Takes about 45 minutes and it\u2019s 3 basic compound movements/lifts per workout, done every other day. I swim laps on 3 of my \u201coff\u201d days with one completely off day. So, I\u2019m always getting a full body workout, although SL 5x5 has you squat in every workout, and that really develops the lower body \u2013 and, conveniently, working your lower body enhances the rest of your body\u2019s growth.\n\nDo whatever you want, but it\u2019s nice to keep it simple and consistent.\n\n~~\n\nThat\u2019s about it. Drink plenty of water (it can dehydrate you in the beginning) and get enough sleep. This stuff works well.", "*THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF YOU CAN DRINK THIS AND GET RESULTS WITHOUT WORKING OUT...... READ AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE!!*\n\nI was always at the 150-160lbs range my entire life and looked skinny even though my height/weight BMI said I was basically in the perfect range. I tried eating more and drinking more of these, went through about 5-6 bags but wasn't religiously taking in as much calories as I could to try to gain some mass/fat/weight...\n\nAs the title says, this is for whoever might be NOT working out and looking to buy this.\nTwo months ago I went thru some crazy epiphany evolving ego death and glimpses into the future of where my soul would go if I kept doing the negative stuff I was doing, etc of which I'll spare you the details.\n\nI weighed myself and I was exactly at 162lbs.\nI can't cook for #$$% so I asked my mom to make some homemade food for me that I could keep in the fridge/freezer so I could eat 3 \"real\" meals a day and not just fast food. Being the best mom in the world that she is, she made me 3 meals a day and I would just go to her house to eat most of the time to eat with the family. After every meal, I would drink a full serving of the Serious Mass. I used whole milk, 2 heaping scoops, 3 big spoonfuls of peanut butter, huge drizzle of honey, and a drizzle of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I didn't notice much difference until about a month of doing this. I tried wearing a few shirts that had fit me loose, but now they were almost stuck to my body (but I still didn't have a FAT belly). I did notice overall \"gains\" in mass in my upper chest/shoulders and especially my upper back. Remember, I NEVER ONCE WORKED OUT OR EXERCISED DURING ALL OF THIS.\n\nFast forward to the end of the 2nd month and now I have a visible FAT BELLY THAT I CAN'T EVEN SUCK IN - WHEN I DO SO, I CAN STILL SEE THE FAT AREAS.... Before all this, my stomach was flat and had NO FAT, when I sucked in my belly it would slightly go IN..... NOT ANYMORE.....\nI'M TYPING THIS WITHOUT A SHIRT ON, SITTING AT MY COMPUTER, AND I SEE 3 LAYERS OF FAT ROLLS DESCENDING DOWN TO THE LARGEST ROLL THAT STOPS RIGHT ABOVE MY WAIST LINE. I NOW EVEN HAVE SOMEWHAT OF \"LOVE HANDLES\". I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MAKE FACES WITH IT. I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MOVE THE ROLLS AND MY ENTIRE BODY MOVES WITH IT. WHEN I WEAR A PLAIN TEE SHIRT, MY STOMACH STICKS OUT AND IS VISIBILE (NOT THE ENTIRE STOMACH THANK GOD, BUT THE MIDDLE SECTION JUST KIND OF POKES OUT AND THE SHIRT RESTS ON IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN). I TRY TO INHALE AND SUCK MY BELLY IN AS HARD AS I CAN AND IT ONLY WORKS FOR A MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE TO EXHALE AND MY BELLY JUST PLOPS RIGHT BACK OUT.\n\nFOR 29 YEARS, I'VE NEVER GONE ABOVE 170lbs - I WAS ALWAYS 150-160LBS WITH LEAN MUSCLE.\nI AM NOW CONSIDERED \"OVERWEIGHT\" ON THE BMI INDEX - 30 IS \"OBESE\", MY CURRENT NUMBER IS 29.1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm typically too busy at work to eat properly, so I had been cramming all of my calories in at the end of the day which was causing my metabolism to yo-yo. I was eating so few calories during the day my body was freaking out and hoarding all the fat and going into starvation mode. I now have one to one and a half servings of this product during the day and it has completely stabilized my metabolism and weight. I have tried MANY other products for this purpose from expensive meal replacement shakes (Huel and Quest) to protein powders of all kinds and they have all tasted nasty, caused upset stomachs and diarrhea, or both. I am happy to say this product has never upset my stomach or caused digestive problems, and it tastes so good (chocolate peanut butter flavor) that I look forward to drinking it each day. I only use cold water to mix it since I don't have to mask the taste, but it is more shake-like if you blend it with milk and ice. Great product!", "this product has helped me tremendously. I have an insanely fast metabolism so gaining weight has always been difficult for me. in about a month or two I gained close to ten pounds. starting at 115. two scoops is one serving size but I fully recommend using one scoop (half a serving). half servings are like regular shakes and are much easier to drink then the intended full two scoop serving. a full serving of any mass gainer is extremely thick and almost like sludge. the flavor on this powder is good and only tastes chalky if you don\u2019t properly blend.

You will gain weight doing that, even if you're just having one large actual meal a day, but now I just make a shake in the morning, However I just found out from my girlfriend that they sell one of these for $24 at Walmart so don't buy it on here it has gone up a few dollars every couple months for the last 2 years this used to be $30 on Amazon, don't get suckered in with their inflation prices this is price gouging like when people were selling rolls of toilet paper for $20 a roll during the plandemic.", "I've used this product for around 2 years now.

Not heaped as it recommends, but about 4/5 a scoop to prevent spilling when taken out of the bag.\n-Liquid: I used whole milk (about 20oz. If using less than it becomes too thick and grainy). It makes it more smooth and creamy. Water will work if needed, but I do not recommend it. Lower fat percentages of milk are alright, though the lower it gets the more it leads to my water comment. Almond milk makes it thicker, adds its flavor to it and yet also somehow makes it watery.\n-Blender: Ninja QB1004 48oz blender. Mix for few seconds, do something for few minutes, mix for few seconds again. Ensures complete incorporation.\n-Eating: 35oz is too big, so I pour it into a bowl.

Ordered this and used it for about 20 minutes in tank. Open black water valve let it run. Then close it let it run open it again. Do this often. Beware!!! Make sure you have someone outside opening and closing it. The tank will fill up fast and over flow. You need to shut water off to toilet for the cleaning wand is put down in tank. It forces water out at end spinning. Lesson learned. Do not take out of tank without shutting water off on the unit!!! Works great!!!! No more smell.", "This wand worked great.

I modified the entire thing. my pipe goes straight down, I measured from the bottom of the tank to the top of the toilet valve, then from the top of valve to the bottom of the pipe 17\". the got a 2\" PVC pipe which fit exactly through the opening in toilet so to not disturb the gasket around valve I don't use the shut off valve on the stick, I connected a regular hose nozzle to the stick, just turn it on and use the lock on thing on nozzle, after centering the stick inside the PVC as best I could, I drilled and tapped 1/4x20 holes saced evenly all the way up the PVC 3 at each interval and used stainless s thumb screws, counting the turns to get it centered at each cotact poing just snug against the stick. make sure to use hose washers wherever the hose screws in I use grease on all hose washers to keep them soft grease both sides of washers. once all is centered and screwed snug with tuimb screws I drilled 1/4' holes along the stick and filled with spray foam insulation and trimmed off any excess out the top and bottom at the brass swivel . then paced 3 1/4x20 thumb screws exactly 18 inches from bottom of the swivel leaving the thumb part out from the PVC to keep it from falling to the bottom of the tank.\n\nIv'e read the reviews about not enough pressure, the trick to more pressure, is to pass as much water as possible through the smallest amount of area as possible. I relaced the airater in the bathroom sink with an airater with a hose connector on it, turn off the hot water heater so can use all the water coming in and not trying to heat the water passing through, I even put a shut off valve on water going into toilet so that water is going through the stick and not just running into the toilet serving no purpose other than filling the tank. I also bought a high pressure washer hose which looks more like a 3/8' hose rater than the standard 1/2' or 5/8'= smaller hose=more pressure, yes my swivel did stop spinning one time, but at the speed that thing turns it's going to get hot the water passes through it not around it keeping it cool it needs lubrication I plugged the two holes in the swivel with fresh bread, opened the shut off valve on the stick, used a funnel abd poured it full if 5-30 oil, hooked up the regulat hose nozzle, turn the ater on full blast and locked it, the bread will hold the oil in until the water is allowed to go through.once the water hose is hooked up open the shut off valve on yellow stick, the water will push the oil, pushing the bread out the oil will lubricate the swivel. I've probably used mine 100 times over the years the swivel has never stopped again.I leave the entire thing together in the storage unfer the camper. you'll need a male to male hose adapter to hookthe washer hose to the hose nozzle found at any hardware store for a couple bucks. when you need to use it, simply turn off hot water heater, put the unit into te toilet, screw the one end of washer hose onto the sink and turn bot sides of faucet on, in two minutes or less you're cleaning your tank without pulling any dirty hoses in throughout trailer!\n\nI'd rated this a 5 if Camco could design the swivel to move up and down like a drive through car wash, apparently there is something stuck on my 1/3 mark? when i clean it it says empty yetwhen I just empty the tank it always reads 1/3 on my sensors panel. I suspect the water is just running over the sensor enough to make it say empty but not blasting whatever it is off? I'm now using the detegent dispensor from my power wsher with dish detergent hopefully, after a few uses it wll clean tha spot? will revise this review if it does? the spray foam does make it a bit heavier but it sure made it simple to use", "I had a lingering odor after emptying the black tank on my camper.

The glitter is pretty, but don't waste your time putting the \"garland\" string of beads on.

Quite a bit larger than the other trees (not Christmas themed) we have tried in the past. The package claims it will only last a couple day, but we had ours up about two months.

I mean, I can get 5 cancer sticks (aka regular tampons) at Cosco for the price of one of these. And that certainly adds up over time! But then again, so does the cost of harming the body with all those chemicals. Urggg.\n\nSo I finally decided that well-being was vastly more important than a few extra bucks each month and thus, made the switch these little bullet looking things, which I call 22\u2019s. Check out the pics and tell me it doesn\u2019t look like the bullet for a 22! I got the kind without the applicator, because it\u2019s less waste for the environment and (ok I admit it) mostly because it was cheaper.\n\nI was actually kind of freaking out about the no applicator thing (I mean how gross that I have to \u2026well, I\u2019ll leave out the details). Well, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it took a few times for me to get used to it, but again, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, I\u2019ve found that an AWESOME perk about the no applicator is that it\u2019s SO small and compact that it takes up virtually no room. Stick one or 2 in my pocket on a night out and I\u2019m good to go!\n\nLast thing to make note of... Again, it might be TMI but heck, what did you expect to get from a tampon review?! So before I had reformed my ways and was still buying cancer sticks, it would sometimes get itchy up there in lady world and would just feel \u2026hard to describe\u2026itchy/uncomfortable/not clean. Since I\u2019ve switched, that never happens anymore! Yay! I\u2019m pretty sure it was my ladyhood revolting at me in the presence of such unclean cancer sticks.\n\nI was NOT paid to do this review or given any free stuff. I did it because I\u2019m hoping that more ladies will make the switch. I know it\u2019s more expensive but your well-being is vastly more important than a few dollars. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert ;)\nAnyways, hope you enjoyed the review and that this helped. Please leave comments or questions if you have any and I\u2019d be SUPER appreciative if you\u2019d be so kind as to rate my review :D\n\nP.S. A few people commented about this being so hard to unwrap. They must have updated the product because it now has an easy peel flap in the middle. I took a pic so you can see what I mean.\nXoxo", "Organic cotton tampons are more expensive than rayon, but they're made with fewer chemicals and the fibers cause less trauma to the vaginal walls so I use them religiously. This one is a great product, easy to use and transport, and since I bought a case I won't need to buy tampons for over a year (FYI, I do the same with the Natracare breathable panty liners -- the only ones that don't leave me with a yeast infection since standard liners with plastic build up moisture).\n\nThe case is pretty compact, so storage isn't a problem and I get to enjoy both savings and convenience of not buying tampons monthly. Keep in mind these do not have an applicator, but I prefer this because they're more discreet (I can hide one in the palm of my hand or pants pocket) and also create less waste than the applicator versions.", "I love these. They are hard to find in stores, and more expensive there to boot.", "Love these things. Buying by the case, I can keep enough tampons everywhere and not worry about running out every time I get my period. And theyre organic so thats important to me. Maybe they could be more comfortable but they are perfect for me in every other way and periods just arent comfortable in general so the pros outweigh the cons", "I used O.B. before. Then suddenly that brand became unavailable EVERYWHERE. I hate plastic and applicators and all the waste. I hate the tampons that grow longer instead of wide.....Blah\n\nThese are comparable to O.B.. I did have a little less cramping...but not much. They are a bit more solid....almost to hard to absorb at first...I found that if I loosened it a bit by sticking my finger in the string end and scrunching it a bit, it made it a bit softer and more absorbent right away.\n\nHave switched to a cup now, but still carry these around for emergencies. Very nice product.", "I get these in bulk for my lady and it makes me a hero. Not only do I care about her body I also care it's as natural as she is.", "Item was damaged and received only one pack, not 12. I want my money back!", "These tampons are really good. It takes a little getting used to not having an applicator, but it's not a big deal.\nMy mind is at ease knowing the fibers are organically grown and do not contain harmful chemicals.\nThey can be a bit tricky to open at times, but mostly they are excellent. I also love the fact that buying them in a large quantity means I have plenty on hand and do not have to reorder frequently. Buying the case is definitely worth the investment and saves money.", "I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice.", "I used to be a die-hard OB user or nothing. These tampons changed my mind. They work better and make me feel better using an organic product instead of non-organic that is treated with pesticides. Would recommend!", "Can't believe it took me this long to find these! Only reason I rated them four instead of five stars is cost. Wish they were more affordable.", "My nether parts are much happier with these than with o.b., which has in recent years made some changes to their tampons. The past couple years using o.b. tampons, I've been having yeast infections after most periods, and tampon removal near the end of my periods has been painful. Since buying these tampons a few months ago, I'm not having these sorts of symptoms so far. Planning to try their pads now too.", "No pesticide sprayed cotton! ;) Treat yourself to cancer free coverage.", "ever since I read about cotton being made from the parts of the cotton plant too high in pesticides and chemicals to be feed to cattle, I use only organic cotton for personal items. These items are easy to use, easy to conceal, discreet and effective. I shared them with several friends who didn't know they weren't conventional and never noticed a difference in performance.", "Awesome Organic product without toxic chemicals", "Great product, I made the switch in June 2016 and will never go back.", "I like these tampons for their organic properties, but I just wish they would be easier to open!", "As tampons, these work fine, but it is incredibly difficult to open these. When I'm having to change these, I don't want to spend 5 minutes trying to get the seal open. I've had to resort to using scissors because the seal is ridiculously difficult. It's actually very frustrating and I can't wait to be done with this pack. This is the sort of thing you want to be able to do in and out super fast, but unfortunately not so.

Don't start with a whole scoop! Start with a quarter scoop. Work you're way up. I eat it on buttered Graham crackers. If you put it in liquid it turns to sludge.

I go to the gym in the mornings and also take medication that works best on an empty stomach. Working off of an empty stomach after hitting the gym can be difficult, so I have added this to my daily routine each morning. This stuff isn't for everyone, especially not for people who have issues with certain textures. It definitely clumps up a lot if you allow it to do so and there is nothing worse than getting a big clump of this stuff when trying to pound it down.\n\nTo avoid clumping I use a 32 ounce Nalgene with a lid and add about two inches of water. Then I take a full scoop of the powder and shake about a third of it into the container. If I see a big clump on the scoop while doing this, I break it up with my finger before pouring it in. After adding a third of the scoop I put the lid on the container and shake it well. Then I add another inch or so of water and half of the remaining scoop and repeat with adding water and shake. Do this one more time to finish the scoop of powder and fill the container to the top and shake vigorously. This is the only way I've found to avoid clumping. Adding one whole scoop at once always results in clumping. The clumps float to the top and can be broken apart with a fork but why deal with that when you can just avoid it all together. Please be aware that this supplement has actual chia seeds and various other seeds/sprouts in it that do not dissolve. This won't go away no matter how much you shake!\n\nThis process may seem like a pain but it only takes a minute and makes it a lot easier to guzzle it down. I know 32 ounces of water may seem like a lot for some people but you just have to get used to chugging it down. Don't let it sit too long because the chia seeds start absorbing water and become a little gelatinous. You should be drinking plenty of water if you want this stuff to work efficiently so this is a good way to get some of your water requirements (or goals) for the day out of the way. I try to get it all down within 10 minutes of making it. Then I'm set for the day!\n\nNot only does this do the job in the gut department, it also helps me feel full and gives me a boost of energy that gets me through until lunch time when I can eat something with some substance to it. It also feel like doing this allows my meds to kick in better. I take them about two hours before the fiber drink.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that this stuff doesn't work for them and my boyfriend tried it for a few months and also said that it didn't help him in the bathroom department, but that's because he wasn't drinking enough water throughout the day. He preferred to drink his mixed with a bit of water in a coffee mug and then didn't drink much water throughout the day. Using a small amount of water makes it incredibly sludgy and gross so I have no idea how he even stomached it. I'm not saying you have to drink a ton of water the second you take it if you prefer to use less, but if you do plan on using it be sure to drink lots of water consistently, even on days you aren't using it.", "hope it works.", "This is a great amount for the price. So a really good deal. There is no flavor so I put it in my oatmeal or smoothie in the mornings. It has worked great for me also. It does what I need it to.", "I purchased it to go in smoothies and save a fortune compared to what I spend at a well known smoothie shop", "Took about a week to truly start to work. Keeps me pretty full to where I can either skip a meal and or eat less. I have lost a bit of weight and I\u2019ve only been a few weeks on it. Great taste.", "Absolutely love the cinnamon taste of it!", "I blend a couple tablespoons of this with a little milk. It's healthy probiotic goodness with a lot of fiber and a fair amount of protein. I drink it right away after I blend it, otherwise after a few seconds it starts getting super think. Best to follow it with some water to aid digestion.", "I did not enjoy the flavor of this product. It's a bit fruity and I personally really taste the cinnamon. Just doesn't work for me.", "This is a good fiber but it's too messy and to dense. I found if i waited too long to drink it the mixture would clump", "Pleasant taste, but if you're looking for something that completely dissolves in liquid, look elsewhere.", "I'm trying to listen to my Dr. for a change and I decided to add more fiber to my diet. I wanted to add a supplement and I tried the orange flavored stuff. It was OK, but I wanted something that tasted more natural than like clumpy Tang with artificial sweetener.\n\nI purchased Garden of Life Super Seed based on the ingredients and good reviews and I am very happy with it. Not only am I getting fiber, I'm getting protein, Omega 3 and all the other good stuff it has. I was a little concerned because it had more calories and I'm overweight, but it is actually helping me lose weight by filling me up.\n\nI've also used it as a meal by mixing it with skim milk and eating it with 7-grain toast with marmalade or a couple of scrambled eggs. I love it mixed with milk. It goes down like a bran muffin in a drink. I also sometimes drink a glass with water 15 minutes before dinner and I noticed I'm able to control my portions much better.\n\nAnother reviewer said it is clumpy, and it is, especially if you wait. That is because fiber absorbs water so as time goes on it gets a little thick. The orange stuff works the same way, so either way you have to drink it quickly or maybe water it down a little and mix it up again (or just drink the thick remainder). OK, it doesn't taste like chocolate cake, but it isn't supposed to. I think this stuff tastes great, especially with milk.\n\nI find that out of the other high fiber foods I've tried (orange stuff, snack bars) this fills me up the best and I feel like my carb cravings have subsided a little.\n\nOver all, I feel my energy level has increased significantly and I have much less mental fog. This isn't due to this particular product per se, but it made it easier for me to increase fiber and lower simple carbs like white flour products and sweets. In addition to this supplement once or twice a day, which is more like a food than a supplement, I'm eating 1 high fiber snack bar a day and trying to eat veggies (I'm allergic to most fruits) at every meal for about 30g of fiber a day. I still eat my favorite bad food (pizza and Chinese food), but I am eating smaller portions-- and not because I'm forcing myself to eat small portions but because I'm full sooner.\n\nI feel great and I'm happy Super Seed is part of my daily diet.", "I am NOT a health nut. I am obese and I trying to get my health/weight/stress levels under control. I also do not have any digestive diseases, however I often suffered from significant discomfort from gas, bloating, constipation, and loose stools. These had been a recent onset in the last year or so, previous to that time, I had no GI upset.\n\nI (very reluctantly) decided that my first round of behavior modification would include getting my digestive system under control by trying to regulate my diet, adding a significant amount of fiber and protein. I was very wary of getting a fiber powder because I don't like gritty textures and don't tolerate \"healthy\" tasting items well either. So I tried this in conjunction with a well-reviewed probiotic.\n\nI cannot express to you how impressed I was with this stuff. It mixes fairly easily (only spoon requires), has TONS of really good stuff for you, and doesn't taste terribly bad. However, here are a few tips:\n\nIf you do not like apples AND cinnamon, you will not like this.\nI find it absolutely disgusting when mixed with just water. It tastes to me like I imagine eating water-y mud would taste like (I literally gagged). However, I can use as little as 4 oz of fruit juice and 8 oz of water and be totally happy with the taste.\nIt tastes fake and almost sour if you mix it with apple juice. Orange, mango, and some combination of peach work wonderfully.\nThat being said, I also highly recommend mixing it with 12 oz or more of liquid if your like me and don't like to drink your apple sauce.\nHIGHLY recommend mixing with ice. Even if it sits out in my hand for a couple of minutes, the combination of thick and luke warm makes me gag.\nTends to settle very quickly, so always stir before you drink (especially important if you do water/juice combo instead of all juice. For whatever reason tends to pull just water to top, cause the water/fiber mixture to gag me). Also, tends to get slimier as well when let to sit more than a minute (also something I have trouble with).\nTo get total relief of my GI symptoms, I have to use twice daily.\n\nDouble BONUS POINTS: It works as a superb appetite suppressant. You really will maintain AT LEAST 4 hours without tummy growling hunger.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I can't live without it. Completely made me a believer!", "I purchased this because it was advertised as being good for diverticulosis. I like the fact that it takes natural food ingredients to add fiber to your diet. I mix it with a little water and it tastes pretty good. It is sweet and fruity. The important thing to remember with this is that it is powerful and you have to know just the right dose for YOU. If you just jump in and start taking it, it will deliver a nightmare from which you won't want to take it again. LOL The instructions should be rewritten to start with a very small amount, like 1 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon. Then increase it until you achieve the results you're after. How much fiber supplement you need really depends on how much fiber you have already eaten in your meal. Take this supplement along with your meal. I take it no later than 5 p.m. with my dinner and allow it to work its magic overnight. Flax seed is known to cause diarrhea if you're not used to taking it or other strong fiber supplements.

It's perfect for two people sitting on chaise lounge chairs. That said, there is an issue. The first time I used it, it worked great. Both nozzles put out a nice mist just the right amount. Second time I used it, one of the nozzles would not work at all. I live in an area that has hard water so I'm not that surprised that this happened, especially when you think about how super tiny the orifice is on the mist nozzles. I did find a way to make the nozzle work again. I took a shot glass and put about 1/3 of a shot of vinegar in the glass. Then I put the nozzle part into the shot glass making sure the vinegar just covered the nozzles and not go above the end cap. I didn't want the vinegar to possibly effect the glue holding on the cap. I left it overnight and the next day it worked just like the first time.

It only mist on one side the other side sprays out it doesn't mist like the other side does.

I'm very pleased with it. I tan on my deck, which tends to get very hot with not much wind. This product arrived in an extremely large box but it was packaged well and arrived undamaged. Setup was very easy and the product performs as it is supposed to. A fine, cool, mist is sprayed from each side of the end and it really does make the area surrounding it cooler. My only complaint is that this thing does not stand up straight. It leans over rather significantly, but it still works!\n\nI would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to stay cool this summer.", "One of my friends had one of these and I loved it! She would hook it up while our kids were playing outside on a hot day and she and I would sit comfortably and watch. She would put a box fan behind it when she had parties and everyone on the patio could enjoy a cooling mist. I decided I had to have one, but couldn't find it at any of our local hardware stores. So I came to Amazon, and here it is!\n\nThe downside is that you don't get to pick your color. However, they picked perfectly for me and sent me one that matches the shutters on my house, so I can't really complain! It works very well, is easy to set up, and does just want I want. Putting a box fan behind it ensures that it blows on the right direction instead of relying on the wind. For the price, this item can't be beat!", "A friend of mine was looking for a misting system to leave in her backyard for her outdoor pets during the hot days in Los Angeles. We found this Orbit misting system and figured we would give it a try. It works well and undoubtedly mists the area to keep it cooler. It's a good product for the price. Some of the other misters are very expensive and take some time to install; therefore, if you are looking for a quick, inexpensive mister that works, then I would recommend this product. The only down side is the fact that you cannot pick the color of your choosing, you basically get whatever is sent.", "Granted, you can't compare this mister to those that are more robust and complicated, but for what it is you can't go wrong. We live in the Sacramento region that has very dry, hot summers. We wanted to get a cheap mister that all we had to do is plug the garden hose into... and the fact that this is a free-standing mister (no installation required) sealed the deal.\n\nRight next to the mister (within about 2-3 feet) it is a wet mist that will leave you feeling a little damp (but cool and comfortable). However, just a little further away you get the cooling without much dampness. The less wind, the better it seems to cool, but a slight breeze doesn't render it useless. It is extremely convenient in that it is reasonably portable.\n\nAn unintended benefit of this mister is that the infant/toddlers that frequented our back yard last summer loved playing with the mister... putting their finger over the nozzle, letting it spray in their faces, etc. It was one of the biggest hits in the back yard for play and for staying cool. It has easily held up to the abuse as well!", "It didn\u2019t come with a washer so water would leak everywhere. We used a washer from an old sprinkler that we had and it worked fine. Great for the garden or to cool off a bit on a hot summer day.", "We use this mister (there are only two little metal mister nozzles at the top) for keeping the pets cool in the heatwave months. The summers get very hot and dry and our three pets hang around the cool water spray most of the day. The water hose can be turned on with just a little pressure and works all day long to provide a fine mist from the top. The wild birds flock to get drinks of water from the mist that falls on the grass. The mister we received was purple and the base is a bit wobbly so we have to use something to prop it on one end to keep from tipping; but there haven't been any issues yet from it falling over. The wobbling is the only issue keeping this at 4 stars instead of 5.", "Living in the South, this mister provides relief when working outside in the yard or just sitting outside reading in the summer. Unlike other misters I have tried, this one doesn't leak when you put it on the hose. Some of these products have a tendency to not be able to thread with your hose sufficiently, thus having leaks and wasting precious water. This provides an even light misting to cool you off without getting soaked. The best part is since the pressure on this is so even, once you turn off your hose, it still provides a mist for about 20-30 minutes later.", "Should keep our patio area a little cooler, but I mostly bought it for the hummingbirds I feed. Hopefully they like it. It was missing the washer, which is the first thing the directions ask you to look for. Not hard to fix, just run to the hardware store and pick up some hose washers, but still annoying. That's why I'm taking off one star. Oh, Just a heads up, it comes in a giant box since this product isn't flexible.", "Works great and easy to set up. I had a MistyMate 10 which has 6 (plastic) misters you screw into 10' of small tubing, right out of the box half of the misters were broken. Not wanting to deal with buying new misting heads, I decided to give this a try. This thing is awesome ! Easy to set up and it doesn't use a lot of water. The best part is, its so portable to move it around where ever you need it. My wife uses it when she sunbathes and when she is thru with it, I move it over to the dog kennel. We have used it all day, everyday for weeks and only once has one of the \"brass\" nozzles clogged up but, a small peice of wire cleared it. I also bought some Gilmore Metal Hose Coupling Filter Washers which helps to filter out any larger size debris.", "I bought this for my daughters birthday party. It was supposed to be over 90 degrees and we had a bounce house so I was afraid the little kids would be over heated. We put this at the end part of the slide so the kids could go through it. Definately was a good idea for us! The kids even fought over it at times and it held up fine (didn't fall apart or anything) . Very light and portable. We put a brick on it to keep it stablized but it wasn't necessary. The kids ended up moving the brick and carrying it all over the place anyways. (or as long as the hose could go) I don't know, long term, the durablity of it since I only used it once so far, but it seems that it would last for a while.", "This works pretty well although I have only tested it a couple times because it's not quite warm enough to use it regularly yet. I purchased this to place near my chicken's run to help cool them off during the hot summer months. The only negative thing I will say so far is that it is slightly bent which causes it so fall over- which is annoying. I have to lean it against something to keep it upright. I will update this post in July or August when it's used regularly.", "This is EXACTLY what we needed. We didn't want to pay a ton of money for an overhead sprinkler system and then we saw these. We are in hot hot south texas weather and we have chickens that need to stay cool. I bought two of these and set them about 25 foot apart in the chicken yard. They hooked up nicely, did not leak, good material, and the mist is so thin it did not even get the coop wet that was only 5 foot away. There was an obvious drop in temperature right away. My chickens come out during the day now instead of staying hidden until evening when the temperature goes down. They are enjoying their yard again and I am enjoying my hens again. THANK YOU! Could not believe how inexpensive such an effective product could be!", "Very surprised by this. It is not going to cover a large space or anything like that but if you are sun bathing or sitting outside this is fantastic. Well worth the money. My toddler thinks it's amusing to put his hand in the mist and get wet. So it is safe around kids. Worst thing they can do is knock it over. It's quite steady by itself due to the design", "OG Floridian here, and I seriously can not take the summer heat without this. I just bring it around with me as I garden, or right next to my chair when I'm laying out. Perfection!", "The misting stand is overall a nice item, and it cools off the area, but it continuously falls over and has to be picked up. I have 3 others that are made with bendable material and these don't have a problem, so I think it is just the fact that it is not stable on a surface that is not flat. So if you are purchasing for a flat surface and not a uneven lawn then this would be a great purchase. Also the other thing I noticed different about this one compared to the other Orbit Misting Stands I have is that the misting holes were on the top and the others that I have are on the nose.", "This summer has been brutally hot on the western shores of Lake Michigan where I slip my sailboat. On a particularly muggy Saturday a few weeks ago I ventured over to a little gathering of my dockmates who happened to have a couple of these set up to cool off the guests. It took me about 5 minutes to log onto Amazon.com and get one of these bad boys on the way! As is often the case, my sailing days since have been spent in the mid-70's so I haven't had a chance to break mine out yet but, given my initial experience with the mister, I'm looking forward to comfortable cocktail hours from here on in! The misting jets are adjustable from a fine vapor up to a pretty good spray. Another one of those million dollar ideas that I wish I had! Fantastic product at a more than reasonable price!", "I have owned a mister like this before years ago. I have been looking for one like I had before.

(Male posting review) I applied the Ban powder fresh right over the aroma that had accumulated yesterday through last night...atop yesterday's used-up Axe antiperspirant. I have yet to catch so much as a WHIFF of myself (which is unheard of under the aforementioned circumstances). That, alone, gives this stuff 4 stars. It is amazingly effective, no doubt!\n\nI bought this based on reviews stating that men wear it. I now question the masculinity of those men. This stuff smells like an elderly woman's underwear drawer, magnified by a factor of 10! (don't ask) The sweet stench of baby powder-like perfume encloses me like a pink shroud of estrogen that once was but can never again be.\n\nI fear that the aroma is causing an imbalance in my personal hormonal stockpiles. Testosterone that I had painstakingly manufactured and stored seems to be evaporating into the retirement home-scented atmosphere around me where it is being chemically converted to empathy and a desire to do arts and crafts, to be inhaled by any unfortunate enough to pass nearby.\n\nSailing past age 40, I certainly don't have testosterone to waste, but I am going to give this product a solid opportunity to adapt to my presence... After all, it IS masking the horror of my stench - AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT! But I fear that I shall soon have to scrub it from my armpits with a mixture of bourbon and barbecue sauce and eat roughly 17 lbs of red meat to reset my system.\n\nAgain, this is a HIGHLY effective product. I bet you could sprinkle it in the pit of an outhouse and leave it smelling like a 5-star restaurant (in a nursing home, but you get the point).\n\nSo the jury is still out, but...

How I hated spending hours at a time glued to a toilet, doubled over in severe pain!\n\nUndoubtedly my parents would give me Imodium, and undoubtedly it would help take the edge off the pain and diarrhea, but when I was given the Imodium sure it would lessen up a bit... but it always seemed to drag the horrid experience out longer, just milder... as I grew older I began to notice the pattern, but did not understand *why*... not for many years.\n\nWhen I finally made the connection of FD&C Blue 1 *always* being connected to \"the punies\" including cramping, bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, diarrhea and sometimes bloody stools, suddenly *everything* made sense!\n\nLike clockwork, when I consumed anything with FD&C Blue 1 again I experienced onset of GI distress symptoms. The more Blue 1 that was consumed or absorbed, the worse the symptoms. This includes far too many brands of colorful children's cereals and sugary beverages, sports drinks, PICKLES or PICKLE RELISH, many brands of *white* marshmallows, mouth wash and tooth paste, hand soap and dish detergent, lotion and unfortunately greenish colored Imodium. I was always in severe abdominal distress. Major GI issues. Again, Imodium would help - but drag out the experience longer. Finally I realized the connection.. sure enough, checking the bottle FD&C Blue 1 is listed in the ingredients. Just 1 smll dose has me doubled over in pain.. again.. or worse.\n\nImodium itself is good at what it does... However, this Imodium contains BLUE 1! FD&C BLUE 1 causes severe abdominal distress in a percentage of the population (many of whom have yet to make the connection). If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea, check out the FDA press release stating blue 1 is \"casually linked\" to fatalities they investigated.\n\nParents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...\n\nPs there is hope! Once I learned to avoid Blue 1 (Whole Foods is the *only* grocery store where I can safely shop without scrutinizing every product label!) my life vastly improved. Now I can almost always pinpoint the now rare GI distress to a new source of Blue 1 \"contamination\" I had not yet realized; the latest being Doppler ultrasound gels used in many hospitals and clinics. Now I know to ask them to use the silver packets of clear gel...\n\nSo if you find you are reaching for the green Imodium A-D a bit too much, start keeping a food diary and find the trend, SOMETHING is potentially triggering the episodes.", "We've all taken imodium at one point or another and knows it's an odd taste.

Extremely well built, no cheap or cheesy parts, fit & finish on the 2 units I purchased & assembled were as close to perfect as possible, considering mass production & relatively low price point for this level of quality & sheer mass, a solid strong build with a subdued muscular look/feel. The matte black rectangular steel outer frame paired with the matte finish silver round/tubular inner frame and gray smoke glass combine to quietly match any style audio/video equipment (most are either black or silver, brushed, matte or gloss) these racks compliment the equipment. The glass is thick and strong supported by this steel frame with heavy duty clear rubber/silicone like material supporting the glass to prevent scratching and more importantly to absorb vibration & prevent any kind of glass movement once set in place. The hardware is high quality, bolts /threads line up correctly, all holes are correctly drilled (plumb and square - so many other kits are not!!!) Assembly is quick/easy assuming you have some common sense experience using basic hand tools. I was concerned that the units would not be strong enough for my high end AVR & multi-channel amplifiers or stable enough for my Analog stereo old school Tube preamp/amp & Record Turntable (that requires a heavily damped vibration free surface) - I bought a pair of these racks - one for the AVR/Surround sound system for Movies (Blu-Ray/DVD, VHS, Laser Disc, Cable Box, Heavy 7 channel amp, etc..) and the other for 2 channel Analog Music sound reproduction (Tape decks, Turntable, DVD-Audio/HDCD/CD Transport & DAC, Vacuum Tube Amps/preamps/tuner/phono preamp, Graphic Equalizers etc..) - These racks are strong enough to support the extreme weight & rack parts/materials used are not affected by the extreme HEAT generated by the vacuum Tube systems, open air rack shelf design allows for the best heat dispersion/air flow & because of the rack's overall mass & low center of gravity, these are the most stable/vibration damping racks I have ever owned/used/seen, even those I have worked on located in professional recording studios, weren't built this well. This combined with a fantastic price & free shipping (when I bought them it was free) for items weighing this much - also fast delivery, you can't go wrong. After almost 3 years and no trouble other than removing dust (Good thing the metal parts do NOT show fingerprints due to textured finish, but the glass does collect dust like any other rack shelf surface material). Cable management system is minimal but functional and easily customized to suit your needs, there is plenty of room in a very wide, but shallow 3 sided box that runs the length top to bottom of the rack (approx 10\" wide, 2\" deep, Length of rack top to bottom) with large oval cut-outs in the rear of each shelf, holes have machined rounded edges so no sharp metal to cut through cable insulation & no need for messy unreliable grommets - plenty of hidden room to hide the cable and separate the high voltage Line cords from the sensitive low voltage A/V input/output cables into separate bundles. Since the back of the cable hide is wide open, it is easily accessible & new cables can be added or removed without taking anything apart. The 5 shelves are evenly spaced with plenty of H/W/D to accommodate all of my equipment with larger devices (Reel to Reel Tape, Turntables) on the top Shelves. Shelves ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE - Because the tubular steel framework that supports each shelf is welded - I rather have a strong welded frame, than weak adjustable potential points of failure on an otherwise indestructible rack system. The all Steel inner silver tubular shelf support system and outer black rectangular frame combined are a heavyweight, heavy duty system that is extremely strong, rigid and stable. Because of the size and weight, 2 adults are needed to move the empty fully assembled racks into position, IOW, these racks, even without any equipment on the shelves, is so heavy/stable that you can't move them (they don't slide on floor because of silicone feet, weight, stability) without some help lifting all 4 legs off the floor simultaneously & placing the rack where you want it. There is no way these would ever tip over, they are so correctly balanced that it would take a huge force just to push it enough to tilt it on 2 of 4 legs. I cannot think of anything negative to say nor can I think of any improvements that I would have made to these racks - I may add some RGB LEDs to the back edge of the Glass Shelves to test whether I can get the edges to light up from the front to add some color/focus on the racks - all angles are accessible so mounting LEDs are simple, if desired.\n\nLove these units and would highly recommend..", "This beast is 91LBS and is not something that I am concerned about falling over. I spent a loooong time debating on the benefits of having one of these towers versus using the TV stand that I currently have in the living room. Everything came to a head one day after I had upgraded my speakers and my Receiver went into power protect mode because it didn't have enough room to breathe when it was in my TV stand. I don't have much to compare it to outside of the $800+ range (my father has a really nice AV tower), but I will definitely say that I am pleased with how this product functions and it is well worth the investment if you're like me and need to get something under $300 to save yourself the headache of purchasing a new receiver.\n\nSome notes on the various aspects of this AV Tower:\n\nThe description states that the shelving is: Distances between shelves: top shelf=7 3/4\"; two center shelves=9 1/4\"; and bottom shelf=8 7/8\"\nThis is incorrect. I took a measuring tape to my AV tower and found that each shelf has 9.5\" between them.\n\nPutting it together: I cannot personally say how difficult this is to do. It's HEAVY, but my 110 LBS girlfriend put it together for me and she said that it took her about an hour because she lost the allen wrench and had to tear apart the living room to find it.\n- I have read some reviews on here where people mention that they had a lot of trouble putting the suction cups on this product. She circumvented this issue by using the alen wrench to push the suction cups in. She said that it worked really well and made it a lot easier/faster.\n\nCable Management: This is probably the weirdest misnomer on this product. There is no \"cable management.\" There are holes in the back where you let the cables hang and can zip tie them yourself if you want them \"managed.\" The odd plastic/tie down device shown in the pictures did not come with my AV tower and nothing in the 4 page instruction booklet indicates that it should have.\n- The unit itself hides cables well if you have something on the bottom shelf and use zip ties, or something along those lines to keep the cables together. Personally, I had a decent amount of excess speaker cable bunched up in the back (in case I need to pull out the receiver to work on it or change speaker cable, etc.) and I found that it hides it well due to the low to the ground construction and the slightly tinted glass/Receiver at the bottom.\n\nLooks: As many other reviewers have stated, it looks really nice. It's got a more rugged texture to the black front and back frame pieces than I had expected, but that's not a bad thing. Additionally, the glass is a bit more clear than it looks in the pictures. I didn't really notice this until I had it sitting in front of me. Again, it's not a bad thing, but it's something that someone else might care about. Overall, I think this piece matches my living room better than I had expected.\n\nSturdiness: Here's the whole reason that we all invest so much time in reading reviews. We want to know if the tower is going to break down and leave all of our expensive equipment dead on the floor. I can say that this tower is solid. I have moved it myself and have done so with a friend helping. You would have to throw quite a bit of energy at this guy to force it to fall over. It would be pretty difficult to find a more stable tower. With that said, if you are looking for a tower that has wheels this does not. I currently have this tower sitting on a area rug in the living room and there are no stability issues - despite the fact that my rug has a pattern than includes varying levels of carpet (ie some places it's very short and very long in others) and it's nearly impossible to have something sit on it that's light.\n\nOverall:\nWell worth the $230 that I paid for it. I would believe that this product goes for a higher value elsewhere. I don't often feel that way about the \"markdowns\" that amazon provides, but this product really does live up to the good reviews.\n\nI will update this as time goes by to allow other reviewers a fair shake before they purchase this. Feel free to leave a comment if you have a question. I will do my best to get to it to help you out.", "Just got this for a steal at $152 plus change, after taxes. I just have to say that it's really nice and has a premium look. Was it my first choice? Not at all, but there comes a time when one must accept that they do not carry the funds to be buying overpriced product that's only overpriced to appeal to people with money. This thing looks great. It feels cheap absolutely zero. I would have a hard time being more happy with anything else I can get my hands on.\n\nOn to the infos - I'm not a huge fan of the method of suction cups for the glass. It was a pain for my thumb to go through installing the cups. The very top holes where the top piece of glass goes, does not agree well at all with the cups. Press as hard as you might, it's probably not going to be enough to get them in. I took my hammer, the only practical thing I could find to hammer on that would work i.e. big enough, not small nor too big-a basic black marker, lined it up in the middle of the cup that was already as far pressed in as I could get it with my thumb, and by gently hammering I could get the cup to go all the way in. The cups and holes on the rest of the rig were a cake walk in comparison. Just press in and twist til they pop in fully.\n\n(NOTE: My size is \"football player\" massive, for the record. So of course I have large hands and as a result, thumbs. Smaller people will PROBABLY have a lot easier time installing the suction cups with much smaller thumbs. Just a heads up to not be too scared off about the suction cups. If you resort to hammer and perhaps a black marker or basic pen to hammer on, you'll probably break it like I did. My reasoning for using a marker and something bigger than the typical bolt or whatnot metal object is I was worried about ruining the suction capability of the cup. Use something big enough not to start poking through the tiny hole on the cup and it should be fine to use)\n\nThe second biggest chore was getting the top glass to go on right i.e. straight and even. I'm 6' but I imagine had I used a small step ladder I could position myself above and make a better placement. The problem that adds onto this problem is it can't be put on evenly due to the backside requiring two L shaped bars to connect the glass to the shelf, so you must connect the bars prior in order to correctly install the glass. I strongly suggest leaving the bars very loose so they work with the glass movement, and let them serve as a guideline to how far back the glass needs to go before you set it. No worries if you get it wrong, the suction cups aren't overpowering and you can retry as often as you need to get it right.\n\nYou'll also see four half circle bars which will confuse you unless someone informs you or you research them. Just do as the photo only instructions show. They will be used for attaching the glass shelves to the metal bars to better stabilize them for I guess when/if you move the tower to another location. These and the L bars will have you install a bolt to tighten to the glass for the connection. I suggest you don't over do it. I did it juuuuust enough to not be loose. Once my two towers are in place I will have zero reason to ever move them anyway, but feel free to turn it tight for another round or three if it makes you feel more secure. It is protected with a something I can't really name. I'll just say you will not be tightening metal to glass. It'll be metal bolt>something white on the end of metal bolt to protect glass>glass.\n\nAs usual I am long winded, so I'll end this quickly with - Tower is a 5 star product. Suction cup pains earns it a 4 star rating. And uh, yeah, this version involves dark glass shelves which fingerprints are particularly fond of to show themselves off. Black or dark is great but...might want to consider the clear version so you don't constantly feel compelled to whip the fingerprints off. I just got it but I see this coming from ten thousand trillion zillion miles away >:/ It's not fully blackened glass. It's more like a really dark DARK shade of sunglasses. You can still see through the glass. I am guessing this is why fingerprints show so badly.", "Pay close attention to the weight listed in the product description: this is NOT your bog-standard cheap-ass particleboard stereo stand. The frames are metal tubes and the beveled glass is decently thick -- which is where a lot of the weight comes from. These are why this is a $200 item vs a $100 item.\n\nNo worries whatsoever about this holding any reasonable amount of weight; in fact my eight year old son (sigh) crawled on top. It could totally support a modern TV of any size, though the overhang on the sides would make that a somewhat precarious arrangement if there were any chance of bumping -- usually a better idea to wall-mount.\n\nOne of the welded brackets that hold on the top from the rear was a bit twisted. I was able to bend it a bit, but at the cost of scratching the powdercoat. It comes with lightweight hardware to anchor to a wall -- I think the CPSC has been on furniture mfg's to include something. I didn't use it, you might want to.\n\nThe gray U frames had a couple of scuffs on them, not a dealbreaker or very noticeable once assembled.\n\nThe most awesome thing about this unit is how the hardware is packaged. Anyone who has wrestled with IKEA kits knows what I mean. Each set of hardware bits is sealed separately into a salp-link chain. Moreover each is labeled with the same part number that the instructions reference. No more wondering which screw is which. This is priceless.\n\nThe worst thing about this unit is the packaging. The metal components come wrapped in plastic bags, which is sad but usual, and thin foam sheets separate the sheets of glass. The nasty bit is that the voids and margins of the box are filled with blocks of EPS, aka styrofoam, that are taped together. This makes it impossible to remove the pieces and properly dispose of the box without EPS beads getting everywhere. IKEA mostly manages to use honeycomb cardboard for this purpose. No reason it couldn't be used here.", "I purchased this for my father so he could reduce the clutter of his audio and video gear and have a tower that would allow him to put his turntable on the top so he didn't have to bend over to use it. He absolutely loves it and I enjoyed that the assembly process was very easy and straight-forward.\n\nOne thing I want to mention is that the box this thing comes in is huge and weighs about 90lbs so it may be hard for some people to move it on their own. The second is there is not a huge amount of Styrofoam around the glass shelves and the first unit shipped had completely cracked and broken shelves. Major kudos to Amazon for having a quick and easy exchange process that allowed for the UPS guy to drop off a new one and pick up the old one in just a few days.\n\nThe tower is comprised of a few heavy-duty metal pieces and glass shelves. The assembly process was quite easy due to the fact that every small part was packaged and labeled clearly. A small tool that is included is all you really need for installation though I found having a small hammer around to get the suction cups that hold the shelves stable made the process a whole lot easier.\n\nOnce assembled this tower is a virtual tank. One thing to remember, and they do warn against this in the instructions, is that when you are moving the tower to grab the metal pieces and not the glass since the glass is not permanently secured. Each glass shelf can handle up to 50lbs which should be fine for most audio gear.\n\nOverall this tower was easy to put together and looks good. Recommended.", "An attractive and well-built audio tower. All the pieces were well-finished and will complement even the finest audiophile or videophile equipment. Keep in mind that this is a open-air tower with only minimal enclosure (on the back there is a metal plate that serves as a backstop as well as a cable guide.) This is mostly good though as air flow is always a concern when using electronics and with the Bush Midnight Mist tower your equipment will have plenty of opportunity to acquire cooler outside air and expel any warmer exhaust. Construction of the unit is straightforward but can be tricky for one person especially when joining the four posts and installing the tempered glass. Having a partner is recommended - particularly if you are not a buff/beefy specimen such as myself! (LOL!) The unit is sturdy and all but the heaviest equipment can be handled without too much issue (some of the larger amplifiers and receivers and certainly many power conditioners/UPS units may need to be located elsewhere.) But keep the weight on any one of the tempered glass shelves under 50 pounds and everything will be hunky.\n\nIf I have any quibble with the Midnight Mist is that the metal plate spanning the center back of the unit could have been made slightly larger and with more ports to more easily accommodate all the connectors and cords that audio-video setups can require. But that is being very picky indeed - this is a well-made and classy place to put your home electronics - be it a three thousand dollar Luxman amplifier or more modest components. Regardless of pedigree all components will look good (or at least better) sitting within this quality piece of audio furniture. Five stars.", "We were looking for a shelving unit to hold all of our media components (tivo, dvd, play station, receiver, internet router) to accompany our wall-mounted 60 inch tv. This was a great size for what we were looking for... perhaps slightly bigger than it seemed in the photos, but its in-person impression is elegant and unobtrusive, so the size wasn't a problem or a deterrent.\n\nTo echo what so many other reviewers have said, this is an exceptional product. It's well worth the money paid, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived at our door, considering we live in Alaska and did not choose to pay for any upgraded shipping.\n\nIt took my husband just under an hour to put together, and there were no problems with misaligned parts/holes, missing products etc. as some others have run into. Overall, it's a great shelving unit for a great price. While the openings in the panel to manage the cords in back aren't huge, we had no problem threading the cords we needed through them, and felt like if they were much bigger (as some reviewers have wished), it would actually make the cords more visible, and decrease the effectiveness of the cord-hiding back panel.\n\nWe have nothing bad to say about our experience. Going on two weeks of ownership and it seems to be holding up like a champ with all of our media components stacked in it successfully. Seems super stable and very durable. No reason to think it won't continue to be a great piece of furniture for many many years into the future.\n\nDefinitely recommend this!", "Wow was this thing heavy. Assembly took about an hour, while watching TV. Definitely get all the screws started before tightening them down. I did not, and I had to loosen a few up to get things to align. Once the frame was together you put plastic suction cup things (yes very technical term) on the top them to hold the glass up. They were a bugger to get in. I licked a few to squeeze them into the frame holes. Getting those little suckers in place was the hardest part of this build, but critical to keep the glass from hitting the shelves. Once they were in the glass was placed easily. The shelves are heavy - I never realized glass was so heavy. The top sheet has a couple clamps on it in the back. The TV weight limit is 50 pounds.\n\nI was able to fit a cable box, Xbox on one shelf. I also put some Games/Blue rays standing up on the bottom shelf. We actually bought a second one (off a local trading site), as a electronic shelf for the tv setup upstairs. So, we would buy it again.\nUltimately we removed the one upstairs for a different type of shelf, that would hold the tv and all the equipment, instead of having the equipment next to the wall mounted TV.", "All in all this is a great piece of furniture. That being said, however, there were some problems which are still being dealt with. When the item was received one of the welds on the tubular side rails was broken off. Contacted the company and a very nice young lady promised to get the part out to me right away, which she did. Received the part in good condition and constructed it without incident. Upon putting the unit in my living room and installing the stereo equipment I discovered that the cross pieces on the replacement tubular unit were 3/4\" higher than on the other tubular unit. This makes the shelves on the entire unit look like they are leaning to one side. Makes a great conversation piece but not exactly what I had hoped for. I am still in the process of working this out with the company. I will say that they are quick to respond and are serious about doing what is right. So, we will see what transpires. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing this unit. Just suggest that they measure the crosspieces before they assemble it to be sure they are the same.\nUpdate to this scenario. Bush industries representative has informed me that they will be checking their replacement parts to be sure they are correct and then will be sending me a replacement part, which means I have to deconstruct it and then reconstruct it, after removing all my stereo equipment. I hope this goes better than the first time.", "This thing looks great, holds lots of equipment, and was easy easy easy to setup. It gives plenty of space for each unit and lots of airflow. I needed to get this thing setup in a crunch, I had my A/V installers on their way to complete installation of my audio/video/surveillance system and I hated the rack they \"sold\" to me. I got this thing out of the box, laid out, and put together in less than 25 mins. I had no help (you don't need any). Everything in the box is clearly labeled and the instructions (for once) were very clear and labeled every screw you need in each step and where it went. Each different type of screw was in a separate bag that was labeled. Each metal part, and glass plate was labeled as well. I don't understand the people who said they needed 2 people to put this together. You don't. I actually think another person would just get in the way, but maybe not. Either way, it wouldn't save much time having 2 people doing it. Anyone is perfectly capable of putting this together by themselves.\nTHIS IS NOT IKEA INSTRUCTIONS!!! It is very clear, very very clear. It doesn't try to combine 5 steps into 1 step. Its easy.\nI personally put this in my media closet because I like the minimal look in my living room, but this could look fantastic in a living room.", "I was stunned at how high quality this piece of furniture is, for the price. I'm used to buying small furniture (desks, bookcases, coffee tables) and assembling the particle board pieces, finding creative ways to replace the pieces that are inevitably missing.... I'm sure that sounds familiar for many of you. But this piece from Bush Furniture was nothing like that! The instructions were very clear, all of the different pieces of hardware were individually bagged and clearly labeled, the glass shelves were well packed, and the metal frame pieces are extremely solid and look much more expensive than this tower actually is. Assembly took about 2 hours (at a leisurely pace) and four hands were necessary several times. The only I'd make different is the cable holes along the back panel; I have a power regulator on my bottom shelf (fancy surge protector for AV components) and couldn't fit all of the cables through the organizer porthole. No big deal, though. Plenty of room for all my cables on each of the other shelves. I love the glass top especially - it makes a good home for the record player. The other shelves hold my AVR, HTPC, Wii U, Xbone, and PS4.\nI love this thing so much that I've actually looked up other products from Bush and will certainly buy from them again in the future.", "This media stand looks great. It's sturdy and strong. Assembly was simple and straight forward.\n\nThe only problem was the product condition upon delivery. I bought it in like new condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I normally have no troubles with orders like this, but this had obviously been mistreated. One of the tempered glass shelves was shattered in the box, and the back panel piece had a bent corner on the bottom.\n\nAmazon worked with me, and with Bush to get a new shelf sent to me, which was good of them. I used a pair of pliers to bend the corner back, relatively into place. Since the stand is in the back corner of my theater room, this defect is never seen, thankfully.\n\nAll in all, it's a great stand, but it loses a star due to poor condition upon delivery.", "This audio tower stand is awesome. It looks very modern and it's very sturdy.\n\nThe box it came in was very heavy. I just took it apart in the garage and carried the different pieces separately into the house. It was packed very well and all pieces were perfect with no dents, dings, or scratches. Was very pleased with that.\n\nThe directions were clear. There are no written instructions, just drawings. You just need to go slow, review the different steps first, and become familiar with all the parts and hardware, which are all labeled very clearly. I have assembled lots of furniture and other items in the past, and this was one of the easiest.\n\nEverything fit together perfectly. I put it together myself. No problem. As a few others have mentioned, the hardest part for me (and it wasnt that big of a deal) was putting in the suction cups. I just pressed hard and used the handle of a pair of scissors to help push/twist them into place.\n\nAll in all, I am so happy with this purchase! Just buy it! You won't regret it.", "I was looking for an attractive, sturdy and roomy A/V rack to house my home theater equipment, and decided to give this a try. It was a GREAT decision. It easily fit three 90-pound power amplifiers, 1 pre/pro amplifier and my Blu-ray player.\n\nMore details below:\n\n1. This was big enough to house all of my A/V components with the exception of my PC and XBOX. My XBOX will actually fit if I place it on top of another component, but I decided to have it stand next to the rack.\n\n2. This rack gives each component room to breathe. Each of my five components have good space above and behind for air to flow, which makes me feel better about heat dissipation and wear/tear.\n\n3. The unit looks beautiful.\n\n4. The unit is simple to put together. You will need someone to help you hold pieces in place, but it can be assembled quickly (30 mins or so). It also comes with the tools you need to assemble it.\n\n5. The unit feels fairly strong and the tempered glass seems feels equally as strong. My 90-pound amps don't seem to phase it at all.\n\n6. The back cord strip does a nice job hiding the cords from front views. It look much neater than my previous entertainment center.\n\n7. Awesome value for the price.\n\nWould HIGHLY recommend this for folks looking for something that looks great, is sturdy and can fit A/V separates.", "Being allergic to most assemble yourself furniture, I set out to find an audio rack made exclusively of metal and glass. One that was heavy and stable enough for my vintage turntable to ride on top. This one ticked all those boxes and at a mere $185 shipped Prime directly from Amazon.\n\nAt 91 lbs it's a beast, but by myself and taking my sweet time, I had it together within an hour. Went together very well. No missing parts. I did use a more robust 4mm L wrench than the one included because I had it on hand.\n\nIt's an absolute work of art and the pics do in no justice! I cut 4 pieces from a mouse pad to further isolate the stand from my hardwood floor and allow it to slide.\n\nIt housed all my A/V components with a unused shelf to spare:\n\nTurntable\nPhono Preamp\n5-Disc CD Changer\n1-Disc CD Player\nBluray Player\nA/V Receiver\nBluetooth Adapter\n\nIt does a fair job of concealing wires, mine is a birdsnest and that reflects my shortcomings, not the stands.\n\nThis is a BEAUTIFUL component rack. I'm proud to own it, and I'd recommend it to everyone!", "I received this item about two weeks ago. It came in a very nice, tightly-bound box with lots of styrofoam insulation to protect the various parts.\n\nTook my wife and me about 30 minutes to put together after we got it unboxed and laid out.\n\nAll of the hardware was in the box, including allen wrenches, screws and little suction cups. Instructions, which consist solely of illustration, were sufficient. I'm not very mechanically inclined at all and I could have easily put it together with no instructions whatsoever. However, it is a two person job to build this behemoth because everything but the cable manager is pretty heavy/unwieldy.\nFinished product? Very nice furniture! It's modern looking and the tinted glass makes it far more attractive than your average glass furniture. And it is very heavy and sturdy too - that is something that I have to have!\nThe only improvement that it could stand? An enclosed cable management system - maybe a little snap-on piece of metal or plastic that would completely cover the wires going up the back. I only say that because I hate to manage the cable mess - I just want to cover it!\nThis is my first ever online furniture purchase and I feel that I got a good product at a good price.", "I am very happy with my purchase of this AV tower. I assembled it alone with no problem, closely following instructions which were adequate. I tightened the screws while the unit was on it's side, as the instructions said. When I stood the unit up it was lopsided, so had to loosen the screws and re tighten them in the standing position to get the rack to stand without wobbling - adding weight also helps. I used 2 tiny screwdrivers to insert the suction cups, the rubbery substance being very durable. One piece of glass was chipped along one edge due to a factory cutting problem. I called Bush Furniture, explained the problem and they cheerfully sent me another piece of glass - they had seen this problem previously. The AV Tower is an awesome unit, very sturdy and beautifully appealing to the eye. The sale price was what sealed the deal. Be aware that glass shelves require a lot of dusting and/or cleaning to look nice. I find the width of the wire routing metal piece to be adequate. The shelves are all evenly vertically spaced. I use this unit as an input device rack, below my 55\" TV hanging from the wall above it.", "Well due to the aesthetics and stellar reviews here I purchased this rack and will have to admit for most general applications it is perfect. Great looking quality rack and a good price. BUT for anyone with a true audiophile system or if you are planning to build one I would stay clear. Only after researching did I find each shelf is suggested to not support more than 50lbs and if you are getting quality components most amps will well exceed this number. I know many reviews people have said they have 100lb units and all is fine but being the shelves are glass, all being fine temporarily doesn't do it for me. Two of my Mcintosh Amps weigh over 133lbs and I wouldn't dare risk it. Not that I even had the option to risk it since both of my amps are 9.5 inches high and each shelf will only accommodate 9\" and are NOT adjustable so keep that in mind as well. For one large component the bottom glass can be removed giving a few more inches but it will then be resting on the floor.\n\nIn total great unit for most but make sure of your total weight and height of not just your components now but what you might add in the future. Also really no need for glass shelves since your components will cover them anyway. If this unit had steel adjustable shelves it would be perfect and this is what I had to replace it with. Sadly I didn't not look into these things and with it build and it just wasn't an option to return.", "Well constructed and a slick look. I scoured the internet (mostly Amazon) and this was the best value in mid- to upper-range A/V tower (marked down from $400 to $215). I put my new Onkyo TX-NR809 (also on sale for $499 through Amazon) in the top inner shelf and the other components below it. My center channel speaker sits on the top glass shelf just below my wall-mounted flat panel TV. The glass shelves sit on some rubber (silicone?) suction cups that isolate from scratches or vibrations. They are locked in place with plastic-tipped threaded set screws.\n\nThe top inner shelf accessibility isn't as good as the lower shelves because of impingement by the black metal frame. I had to bring my receiver in through the side. If the unit was a little bit deeper (1-2\") that would be ideal as it was difficult getting all the cables plugged in. The back panel of the Audio tower and the slits in the back panel could be a bit wider to better manage and hide all of the cables from A/V equipment. If the unit had lockable casters, that would be good as well. Otherwise I can't complain.", "This audio stand is beautiful. It makes me want to buy a better looking stereo.\n\nIt's also solid as a rock. I just wish it was square. Quality control needs to be tightened up during the manufacturing process. If it didn't weigh 90 lbs. and would have been a b-word to repack, I would have sent it back.\n\nThe \"vibration dampening pads\" are just suction cups. For the money, I was expecting a real anti-vibration system.\n\nI do have to give Bush Furniture a shout out for cleaning up Amazon's mess: my shipment was missing the parts list and assembly instructions and the hardware pack was torn so screws and small parts were scattered all over the box. I called Bush Customer Service and they emailed me a PDF of the parts list so I could take inventory and recontact them to have any missing parts sent via overnight. Very good customer service."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W8OWIG", "title": "BUSH BUSINESS FURNITURE Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet in Hansen Cherry", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/9198XbRii3L._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "121 ratings", "description": "Customize your storage with the BBF Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet finished in Hansen Cherry for classic styling with clean lines.

On the downside, it had damage to the back panel that is visible on both sides (see photo taken as we were unboxing the product). After my husband determined that it probably would not impact the structural integrity, we decided to \"live with it\". He put it together and there were two issues with the hardware. The door lock only seems to lock one door, which is useless since the entire width of the cabinet can still be accessed by opening the other door. Secondly, as a tip for others, he said that the best way to install the doors (the hinges) was to remove the adjustment screws first and then slide the door's hinges all the way into the receiving hardware, and then everything should be pretty square and straight if the cabinet was correctly assembled. My only other comment is that a couple of hours after I placed the order, I realized that i had accidentally used our debit card instead of my Amazon store card (my intended payment method) and I didn't catch it at that moment (my fault). So I asked this company to cancel the order so I could reorder again with my preferred payment method, and they said basically just said \"No\". I had also ordered another Bush office furniture piece that was through a different company on Amazon, and they were very helpful and accommodating (quite pleasant). So that aspect compared between these two companies was like night and day. So I definitely didn't want to try to return this one with the damaged part after the prior attempt to work with them to cancel this order. The cabinet itself looks good with my other furniture and will prove to be quite useful.", "This is the second Bush cabinet that I\u2019ve built. Yes, the locking mechanism is weak, but I didn\u2019t buy the cabinet for security. I wish that Bush had included a plug of some kind to fill the lock hole. Assembly was straightforward and relatively easy. It is very heavy, 89 pounds, but it is also very robust being able to support 100 pounds on top easily. I actually had to order this twice. The first time, FedEx lost the box somewhere in New Mexico where it still remains. Bush was quick refund the amount I paid for that shipment. I repurchased it and it was here in just a few days, instead of taking a circuitous route around the western US like the first one...", "The BBF brand is one of the best RTA furniture you can get and super easy to assemble with clear instructions. I have been buying BBF pieces for 16 years and will continue.\n\nThe 30\u201d width of this cabinet perfect as a printer stand with room for an inbox tray on the side. I like this better than the piler piece at only 24\u201d.\n\nThe Cherry laminate of this Series C piece matches my Series A pieces but I prefer the rounded corners of Series A. This piece has right angle corners.\n\nThis has a backside hole with grommet for cords if you want to power something behind the doors.", "Shipped quickly, seems very sturdy", "I purchased this cabinet for extra storage in my home office. It is attractive in appearance but putting it together gave my husband a bit of a challenge. (Could be his skills!) I ordered a second shelf which added more space for what I needed. Why it isn't part of the initial offering I don't know. The lock is quite cheesy and so if you're trying to protect any secure documents forget about it. All you need to do is pull hard on the doors even with the lock on and they open. A few screws were missing but the customer service at the company was great and they sent them immediately. I am overall satisfied with the piece. I guess for the price it is a good addition.", "I have purchased about 7 various pieces this Bush Business Furniture in Hansen Cherry. I am a bit neurotic when it comes to office furniture and I wanted something that would last. It had to be able to take the abuse of well\u2026.actually using it.\nI must say that I have been impressed so far. All of the sets came shipped on varying days from different shippers over a one week period. The packing is very impressive. Each piece of wood inside the box is wrapped in foam and/or foam like paper. One box appeared to have taken a beating, but no damage to the items. Several boxes weighed over 120lbs.\nAssembly varied depending on the item. If it had drawers, it took longer than a desk with two legs. Following the instructions was easy as long as you made sure you chose the correct fasteners for each step. (correct screws)\nThey look very nice with thick laminate and they are extremely sturdy. If you want a commercial grade product at a fair price, look no further.", "This office set is awesome! Not only is the product outstanding, so is the customer service folks. I had a small dig in the top of my desk and they sent me another top. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I don't use the locks, so can't provide info on the issue that everyone has complained about. If you follow the instructions, you'll be fine. Let's face it, locks only keep out honest people. They look amazing!", "Used for extra office storage space and surface.", "I needed a solid cabinet with a lock for use at our church by one of our groups and this one turned out great.

The cabinet can be opened even it is locked.", "We were looking for a cabinet that locked so that is the main reason we chose the Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet. We were disappointed because, although it does lock, it doesn't lock well. To begin with, the locking mechanism simply locks against the other door rather than connecting the 2 doors and latching against something else. What this means to me is that it can be opened without a key even it if it locked. All that is necessary is to pull the doors open far enough the locking latch will simply separate from the other door. This really doesn't help me. For anyone needing a cabinet that securely locks, this is not the one!", "I have put together alot of stuff and this was very easy.", "Heavy-duty storage, very attractive as well.", "Purchased this office storage cabinet to replace a much older cabinet.

On arrival two pieces were damaged and a short call to BBF had replacement pieces on the way that same day.\n\nI recently remodeled my home office and got 6 pieces from this BBF furniture line.

As many others have realized, it's awesome not having the white flaky residue and ruined clothing that I used to get from using the white-solid anti-perspirants.\n\nFRAGRANCE - 3.8/5.0\nIn my opinion I find the fragrance of this product to be almost gender neutral, meaning men or women could probably use it. I'll be honest, my girl likes the smell, but not nearly as much as some of the other products like Speed Stick Gel that have more traditionally \"manly\" scents. That being said, the Old Spice High Endurance Sport Scent can be more appropriate for business environments where you just want to smell clean (like soap), and not like you're wearing cologne in preparation to go out to the club! Also, this product has a fairly strong level of scent, especially right after application. If you or someone close to you is sensitive to strong fragrances, apply a bit less of the Old Spice if you're going to be in close proximity to them for a while.\n\nAPPLICATOR - 3.0/5.0\nI don't exactly love the applicator. Most other products click up in small increments when you turn the applicator. The Old Spice doesn't click so it's harder to know how much you have raised the product since it's crystal clear. I don't want to apply too much so I raise it just a bit at a time and end up having to go back and raise it more until I can start to feel it apply to my skin. This is just a bit more aggravating and time consuming than clicking it up one or two notches and knowing how much product will be dispensed. It's not the end of the world, but it's noticeable to me.\n\nPERFORMANCE - 4.8/5.0\nOne of my favorite things about this stuff is how long it lasts. I can usually go a full 24 hrs and still smell great. This is probably the longest lasting deodorant I have ever used! It seems to have the same active ingredient and percentage as other similar products but it pretty much outlasts everything else I have used.\n\nWASH-ABILITY - 4.5/5.0\nTo me one of the most important things to consider with a deodorant product is how well it washes off my skin and clothing. I hate the products that are so waterproof they don't wash off clean even after a hot shower. Most of the white-solid anti-perspirants are like that, but so are some gel products. Also, I don't want the product to build up in the armpits of my shirts even after being laundered - again, the white-solid products are the worst culprits for this. I find the Old Spice High Endurance to be quite easy to wash away in the shower, and I haven't noticed any build-up in my shirts, which is awesome for such an effective product!\n\nAVERAGE SCORE: 4.0\n\n**** RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****", "The price is Too high!

I received it surprisingly quick and opened the box right away. It was packed very protectively and was super easy to put the legs on. It is a bit top heavy, but, they actually have a chain on the back of it to attach to the wall so it won't fall over. I didn't think it was that bad, so I didn't attach it....but the option is there just in case. There was a faint varnish smell, which has gone away already. They drawers are roomy....two of them are sectioned...the others are are not. The top opens for more storage and has a ring section as well....there's also a mirror.

I believe it\u2019s solid wood it doesn\u2019t feel like any kind of particle or anything like that and it\u2019s very very nice. I\u2019ve seen similar items in stores smelling musty and nasty this one arrived smelling wonderful.", "A little misleading.

I have not found a need to use this feature as the Armoire stands alone effectively without being anchored to the wall. The Armoire has four drawers with plenty of sectioned off, divided space to place earrings or bracelets that you can separate by gold, silver or costume and also has two large, deep drawers that will hold a combination of jewelry types.

It doesn't add any shine to my hair nor does it make it look dull. It allow my hair to look natural and doesn't cause that hardened hairspray use. It also helps to keep the volume in my hair after blowing it dry, although since my hair is so fine there is always some flattening as the day goes on no matter what products I use.

I tend to skip exfoliation because I find it doesn't do me much good. For cleansing it's important that you find a cleanser that is effective enough to remove the excess oil and any other dirt from your skin, but not so aggressive as to irritate the skin. Neutrogena has a good reputation for making effective but gentle skin products and this is no exception. Then, there is salicylic acid. This is a somewhat effective medication for treating hyperactive sebaceous glands, which produce the sebum that can clog the pores, ultimately leading to acne. It's not strong enough to work for all cases of acne, but it's fairly mild as far as these things go, so if it's strong enough for your particular case of acne, it's a good one to go with. It didn't used to cut it for me when my acne was worse, but as I've gotten older my acne has become milder, and it turns out that by using this cleanser every day while showering, I am pretty much able to constrain my acne to a very occasional lonely zit. The occasional zits are small and disappear quickly without becoming big, infected, or painful. The cleanser is an excellent vehicle for delivering this medication to the skin. Neutrogena and its competing brand, Clean & Clear, also make toners and moisturizers that contain the same ingredient. It generally doesn't hurt to use those as well; a little extra salicylic acid from using multiple products that contain it does not seem to become too much very soon. (You'll notice if it becomes too much because it will dry out the skin too much.) I have been purchasing this product and various store-brand knock offs of this product for many years, and it has served me well. These days, because I know I use it anyway, I tend to just order it on Amazon, and get a few at a time.

The product was delivered on a warm southern California day of 73 degrees, and had melted by the time it arrived at my door.", "Works really well. For years, I have been using an expensive clinical strength because it was the only thing that really worked for me. Figured I would give this a try since it was a good deal and it works so well. And 6 of these were the same price as one of the others so that is awesome. The scent is really nice too, not overpowering like most men's deodorant.

I can dust areas that stuff gets tipped over but the fibers so thin and light it does not make much tip over. I wish the handle can extend but for what it is a 5 star product.

Thanks a lot!", "If you want a fast and easy way to dust, this is my go to. I have been using static dusters for years to make cleaning a breeze. They really work to trap the dust which is evident when I take it out to shake it. I have found this duster lasts a long time before it breaks.

I would recommend it for indoors.", "Works great, better than a swifter. Doesn't fall off and easy to clean.", "Great value for the price! Not for heavy duty use though. That should have been obvious by the price, but some people just don't get it. Some people expect something amazing to do incredible things for almost no money. And how do you think people make any profit? For getting those cobwebs in the corners and up along the sides of my apartment building it worked great! Originally was buying one for my neighbor, but saw the price was so low and extended so long and how strong does it have to be for some cobwebs? So I got one for myself as well. Extends quite a bit. Not meant for heavy scrubbing at a distance. That's just silly, and people that leave negative reviews for giving this a hard workout extended to scrub at things, like it's for industrial use, need to get a brain. Very happy with my purchases.", "Great value. My two concerns are the handle is not the most comfortable to use if you are dusting for an extended period of time and the instructions are not very helpful for cleaning options of the duster. As a consumer using this product I recommend wearing safety eyewear and a mask, especially if outside and moving dusty items. My opinion two manageable issues.", "I purchased this specifically for clearing cobwebs in one corner of my home that is high up and hard to reach AND to clean out my shed... Oh my shed... When my wife and I first purchased our home, I swear our shed was the spider headquarters for our neighborhood... It was bad... I turned that shed into a water park with how much insect killer I sprayed... Once everything was dry, I went in with my handy dandy cobweb clearer and cleaned house! Well, cleaned shed... It worked like a charm! I can now walk into my shed without feeling like someone just put my moms old stretched out nylons over my face! Lifesaver!", "I'm not exactly a duster connoisseur, so maybe they're all like that, but this product doesn't seem useful at all.

It feels super cheap, and the bristles aren\u2019t fluffy and soft. It feels more like cheap kids\u2019 Pom-poms. What\u2019s worst, is that even after a thorough cleaning with mild dish soap, this duster ATTRACTS GLOBS OF DUST THEN REPELS THEM BACK ONTO MY FURNITURE!!

You'll be looking Aussome in no time!", "reviews": ["I've read some reviews on here about how this didn't do anything and/or the smell was bad and lingered.\nI'll start by saying that they must have either gotten a bad batch, ranging in really strong smell and/or it was an old batch that was\nleft to linger. Either way the ones I got are perfect. The smell is not strong (I should know. My mother has this coconut butter perfume that is stupid strong and I can't stand it. This is weak in smell compared to that.) and it's done wonders on my hair. I know this because I bought this specifically because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner and it works.\n\nI had to bleach my hair twice and I have since used this conditioner (no shampoo after bleaching) and left it in the 3 minutes, maybe more, to have my hair come out silky smooth. That's saying a lot from me, because I have naturally curly, thick hair. I'm mixed so I've got my fathers hair more than my mom's, but this did what it was suppose to do. It kept my hair from feeling like straw (as it would after bleaching) and it's even worked on the tips of my hair which were really fried after the 2 bleaching sessions. Keep in mind that I shower in the morning and at night (I only wash my hair 1 day out of the week. When not bleached.) and was using this each time as I wanted to strengthen my hair again before I tone it.\n\nAnyways, it does what I need it to do. Keep my hair from looking like a straw man's head!", "I just moved to North Dakota where it is so extremely windy, cold, and dry and my hair is showing it dramatically. I have spent probably $150+ on deep conditioners, oils, masks, anything I could find to keep my hair from being so brittle and breaking, not just at the ends, but even half way up the strand. My boyfriend brought this home off of the clearance rack at Walmart and my hair has never been softer since I moved up here. I wash my hair between 1-2 times a week and I use about a palms worth of this each time. In a different climate, it would probably make my hair greasy, but it has been a life saver up here. I only gave it 4 stars because while this is the best my hair has looked while up here, it's certainly not the forever solution I'm looking for since my hair is still dry, just not nearly as dry as it was!", "I bought this product after reading raving reviews about it online, watching videos and everything from almost every beauty and hair care blog and website out there. They were all saying how perfect this is, because it smells good, because it's so simple and quick, and especially because it's so affordable.\nThat is why I immediately jumped and bought myself a pack of 4 instead of trying just one. Well, that was a bit of a rash decision; the product isn't bad. It really works very well with my hair and with all kinds of hair, it really costs a fraction of the price of most other masks and it's so simple and fast, it's amazing. The smell, however, is a bit of a problem for me.\nI couldn't pinpoint the smell, it felt like it was changing, constantly.\nIn a nutshell, the scent reminded me of one of those bottles of perfume there are for younger girls who want to feel like adults. You know, the colorful bottles, smaller ones, made for tweens, early teens, those bottles that sit next to the glitter body lotions and stuff. Those things have a very strong sweet scent, and that's what this smells like.\nIt felt like I was rubbing candy in my hair, and I didn't like it at all. It's very very strong.\n\nIf you like sweet scents or if you don't mind, I really recommend this from the bottom of my heart.\nIf you're more sensitive to that type of thing, I would steer clear of this product.", "I can not tell you how well this works, you'll just have to try it!! But I can tell you that this stuff is a miracle in a freakin bottle. My hand is thick, like my pony tail is literally an inch, around mid tail, but the strands are fine and I die it, flat iron, and blow dry it every night, so it was starting to feel like hay, just so dry and brittle. I used this the first time, and I noticed a slight difference, but nothing to drastic, but I decided to keep trying, and the second time, my split ends were no longer split and my hay hair felt like crushed silk. By the third use my hair was falling in russet waves with no damage and I was tearing up it looked so good. I haven't had hair like this since I was little, and my boyfriend even said something. (This is the same guy who doesn't even notice when I get my hair cut or colored.)He kept messing with it, I finally had to tell him to stop because it was getting annoying. This stuff is worth its weight in platinum. If you are tired of dealing with hay hair, and nothing seems to be working, give this stuff a go. Its cheaper than most remedies and it smells SO GOOD!! You'll love it, and I'll be your hair will soak it up like sunshine!!", "Love this. I remember using it for the first time a few years ago and I never use anything other than this product now. I always thought I'd have to spend a lot of money for something great, but on a whim I bought this because, honestly, I needed to meet my amount for the prime free shipping.\n\nOccasionally though I'll substitute this with the more expensive It's a Miracle 10. But that's because I bought a 32oz and it's lasting me forever and impossible to finish, haha.\n\nFor the price, this conditioner is a steal. After shampooing and rinsing my hair, I'll apply the conditioner and leave on for a few minutes. I've noticed though that if I keep it on my scalp as well, it'll make my head a bit oily as the day goes on. So I usually just concentrate it on my hair past my head and all is good. I love how it gives weight to my hair strands so that they don't feel brittle and fizzes away in the wind.", "I've been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine. There's a pleasant slight coconut fragrance. My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week. Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy. Often I'll use it while having a hot cup of tea, leaving it on more than 3 minutes in a plastic shower cap or one for processing; uplifting for hair and spirit.\n\nThe formulation has changed AGAIN since the original. It does seem thicker and rinses cleaner with less residue. It's not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it's very close.\n\nI recommend it.", "This deep conditioner is really good. I understand a lot of naturals may not rate it very high because its not considered sulfate and paraben free. however, this works wonders on softening and conditioning my hair. I use it in between regular heat deep conditioning because I work out a lot and co-wash and shampoo my hair more than normal. This is one of my staples and has been a contributing factor to the health and growth of my hair. I've purchased the four pack before and plan to continue as long as it works for me. It may not work for everyone, as we each respond differently to products based on our hair texture, porosity and other factors, not because someone says so. Try it and make your own informed decision.", "I use this once or twice a week, and it makes my hair so shiny! In fact, when I was a kid, I spent a long time in a hot tub that, apparently, had just been shocked with way too much bleach, and my hair dried out so badly that I was considering a drastic hair cut. Like, I could hold it by the roots and all two feet of it would stand out straight! I spent weeks using home remedies and products to try to fix the damage, and nothing worked. My mom had some 3 Minute Miracle, and she said if THIS doesn't work, we'll just have to cut my hair short. I used this ONCE and my hair was back to normal! It's been over 10 years since the Hot Tub incident, and I still keep this stuff as a staple.", "I'm one of those people with weird asian hair. My bangs and top/roots of my hair are very thick and oily, but the back and ends of my hair are dry and brittle. So I've long looked for a product that will help my situation. This really hydrated my hair well and smells really good. I use it once to twice a week to help my hair with its dry and brittle tendencies.\n\nHowever, there are some cons.\n**NOTE THAT THIS IS FROM THE EXPERIENCE FROM MY HAIR AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO EVERYONE**\n- Because of how dry my hair is, I have to leave it on much longer than its supposed \"3 minutes miracle\" (5-10 mins/ more on extremely dry days)\n- Have to use a lot to fully hydrate the hair thoroughly\n- Have to follow with the aussie leave-in conditioning spray to fully hydrate", "I've tried one bazillion conditioners. really. I have quite the relationship with my hair. No matter what I do, I keep coming back to the 3 minute miracle. Some one left a bottle at my house by accident, didnt need it back, so I plopped it on, not expecting much. That was 5 years ago, at least. I buy it in bulk. If anyone knows of a conditioner that gets tangles out as easily as this cheap stuff does, I am always willing to try it, but nothing in my opinion comes close to this. Really.", "I do not scrimp on hair products- at 50 plus, my not-yet-gray hair is the youngest looking thing I have going. So I use Fekkai shampoo, Goldwell's leave-in serum, & a Malibu de-mineralizer once a week to abate the effects of well-water.\n\nBut when it comes to an everyday conditioner, you can't beat \"Aussie Moist 3 Minute Miracle\"- even at many times the price. I've tried many upscale & salon brand conditioners over the years, but always go back to this stuff. It really is a bit of a \"miracle.\" You can feel split rough ends (from heat styling, etc.) resolve in the time it sits on your locks. As you rinse, smoothness reigns again.\n\nGive it a try & you, too will be buying the 4-packs & 6-packs offered here on Amazon.", "I have used this conditioner for about 3 months now after switching from Infusium 23 Moisture brand. I like this conditioner a lot better. My hair is fairly curly and has some frizz to it so I was looking for something that would help weigh it down. This does just that, after the 3 minute wait, the conditioner rinses with no oily or other residue. After drying and applying some other leave in product my hair feels and looks great. After using this I use less of my leave in product, and it seems to thicken and weigh my hair a little which gives me a better handle on the curls. Highly recommended!", "I'm always looking for the holy grail of hair conditioners, so I can't tell you how many different ones I've tried over the years, but it must be dozens and dozens. And I always keep coming back to this one, because it does the trick for my fine, dry hair. I don't know why I stray...why I imagine that there's anything better, I should know by now that there isn't. And you sure can't beat the price. It makes my hair soft and silky, without weighing it down. It's worth the three minutes!", "Literally a Miracle.\nMy hair is dull, dry, split, and falling out from years of dyeing and a recent harsh bleaching. This product is AMAZING. In just 3 minutes my hair had so much more moisture. It was incredible. I bought the 3-pack of this and I am so glad I did. This along with a few other Aussie products I've ordered (Hair Insurance Split End Protector; Smooth N' Bloom Conditioner) has improved the health of my hair tremendously.\n\nI absolutely ADORE this product and WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. It's a real life saver. You have to try it to believe!", "I have the stupidest hair texture. I have curls but they're not pretty, they just look deformed mostly. I have to either straighten my hair or look like a wreck. My hair is a frizzy, huge mess that can't be controlled by much. This stuff is the best product I've used to get more softness and smoothness to my hair. I LOOOVE it. I really do. I bought the four pack and will again as soon as I run out. It surprisingly lasts a long time even though I have thick, long hair and use globs of the stuff!", "I am relaxed and have been on my healthy hair journey about 18 months now. Although I have solidifed most of my staple products I have never been happy with any of my conditioners ranging from both high end and low end products. Aussie is my new staple. I love how thick it is, and I love how moisturized my hair feels after just 3 min. I leave it on a little bit longer as I do my other shower rituals and my hair loves it! Detangling is a cinch! I dont really care for how the bottle is made, but not a huge deterrance for me. This product is a welcomed staple in my reggie!", "After years of torturing my hair with chemicals, I didn't know what to do with my hair. I accepted it's fate as a dry, frizzy exchange for a broom. Then suddenly I tried this product....\n\nMy hair started singing! Okay maybe not literally. But after the first use my hair felt so moisturized and bouncy, I finally achieved that mermaid look you get from spending a day at the beach.... without going to the beach.\n\nAll my life people commented on how frizzy my hair was... but for the first time someone actually remarked on how healthy it looks. I am sold on this product for life. I'm never using any other conditioner again!", "I'm a guy and I've been using this conditioner for years now, still giving me the results from day one: soft and silky hair! This is perfect for a daily conditioner and works as a hair mask if you leave it in longer. I usually leave it in for 10-15 minutes once and a week and then 3 as described on the product for everyday use.\n\nI use a lot of heat tools on my hair so this is perfect if you need a lot of moisture in your hair!", "This is a GREAT product especially for those of us who work in chlorinated pools. If you use enough of the product after every time you are in the pool, it will protect your hair and keep it in great shape. Those who cut my hair always comment on how wonderfully my hair looks and feels. I've been using this for over 5 years and I love it! Being able to buy it in bulk is a real boon as the product is not always available in the store when I need it. Plus... there is a slight savings.", "I have been a long time believer in this product, I have very long natural virgin hair and it still tends to get dry from heat due to blow drying and styling.\n\nThe Cons:\nNot enough in bottle\nCan leave hair heavy and oily if to much is used\n\nPros:\nLeaves hair shiny, moisturized and bouncy cutting down on damage\nSmells like coconuts\n\nI would recommend this product to anyone, and the price of this works amazing I like this so much more than the salon products I have tried."]}]}
