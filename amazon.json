And for just as long, have always set the can in the sink of medium hot water to warm up the cream before shaving. Never had one explode yet! My last order (from a different vendor) were different in the fact that there were no foil/paper labels on the cans, the labels were directly printed on the metallic cans and I never had to worry about the labels peeling off in the hot water. I noticed that this set of shaving cream have the foil/paper labels, so I suspect they are going to peel after a couple of uses, but no big deal. Just wish there would have been a way to know this before ordering.", "I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel. I didn't know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too. Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!). I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I've used in the past. However, as other reviewers have noted, it's not as \"rich\" or full-bodied when it comes out of the can. The 'instructions' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams). Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it's good foam, and I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the 'watery' consistency when it comes out of the can. This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).\n\nIn summary:\n* If you like foam, you may like this one. 3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.\n* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won't like it. However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you'd like it.", "I've been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I'm out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren't even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number people you have.\n\nIn terms of the cream itself, I'm a big fan of foam over gel as you don't have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette's is good at all that. I don't have sensitive skin, but I've always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.\n\nEverything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).", "Nice value for the dollar.\nNot sure what \"sheerness\" and \"thickness\" have to do with shaving cream so I can't \"rate\" them.\nI've used this cream exclusively for some time and it works well.", "This is a great shaving cream foam.

It is like getting almost three FREE cans with a three can purchase. Shelf life is not a problem either if kept in a cool place. No, the garage is a bad idea as is over the stove or on the mantle above the fireplace. This is a good deal.", "I wasn't able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value. I haven't experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it's perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use. Take note, this is a foam, not a gel, and it comes out all foam. I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation. Not much you can say...it's shaving foam. It is what it is.", "I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular. Then recently, by accident, I picked one of these Gillete foam styles off the store shelf. Because I didn't realize my mistake until a couple of weeks later, I decided to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I'm speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.", "The can looked like the one he likes however it wasn't the gel he thought it would be.

I was bullied in school for my large pit-stains, and would always have wet circles under my pits, regardless of the temperature outside. I went through several prescriptions from my doctor, which only irritated my skin and made it itch and burn like fire, preventing me from sleep. I received a sample of this product through a female care sample pack through a clinic, and fell in love. I have now been using this deodorant for almost 10 years, and have never been happier with a deodorant. Yes, I still do sweat if it's really hot out, or while working, but that's to be given with any deodorant I believe. Applying this product at night and in the morning has solved the huge wet circles I was always embarrassed of.\n\nAlso, this product smells fantastic, and has not irritated my skin even after applying twice daily.

I only roll it up one \"click\" and put it on; you don't need much. But, my complaint is how darn hard it is to turn that dial, If you have hand issues, this may not be for you. I do not like smells in my products, but bought this because people said the smell was light and i either couldn't find or didn't want the fragrance free one (cannot remember now). The fragrance is not bad. It is lighter than many and doesn't smell for long. That said, if you are sensitive to fragrance, it is noticeable when you put it on.\n\nHave no idea how long it will last - given it's price, I hope longer than the last kind I used.", "Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out. This deodorant, seriously changed my whole life. I have always been a sweaty armpit person (not a smelly sweaty, but constant sweat), and was SO insecure about it. All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn't like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter. I put this on after showering, and don't have to reapply until my next shower, even if that is two days later. I thought maybe I grew out of the problem, but have tried over the years not using it, and a couple of times have forgotten it when I traveled, and I definitely still sweat like crazy. No other deodorant works even a little for me. This is THE ONLY one I can use with success. And it smells awesome! People sometimes ask me what perfume I'm wearing, and I tell them it's my D.O., haha. I don't like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the 'powder' scent (gag).", "Definitely one of my best and trusted tried and true, Go-Tod. Easy application, lasts longer than competitors, nice scent, and great odour protection!", "This has been my favorite deodorant for years, but now that we\u2019ve moved from the desert to a warm humid climate this is a life saver. I\u2019ve tried switching to the more natural (aluminum free) deodorants that everyone raves about, but I end up smelling and with soaked T-shirt\u2019s. Secret clinical strength never fails me, and I love the fresh light scent that doesn\u2019t overpower.

These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.\n\nI will increase two two clicks each arm day and night.

Good points:\n- The lavender scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.\n- It seems to keep me smelling fresh.\n\nI'm not giving it a higher rating because:\n- The gel is extremely sticky/tacky and stays that way all day without ever absorbing into my skin although I apply a very small amount (1-click).

I tried these hoping they would be an economical version - while they are less expensive, I find that because they are thin and hard and not so absorbant, that I am using 3x the number of towels as normal. I really did not like these towels and felt I would rather pay a little more and get a better quality towel... Sorry, but that's how I feel in regards to using these BASIC towels for home use as a replacement for paper towels.

Nevertheless, this product served its purpose as replacements for paper towels rolls and disposable table napkins.\n\nIt's now close to the end of June 2020 and we still have a lot of these paper towels left. I packed the bundles separately in plastic wrap to protect them from moisture, contamination & pests. This also made it easier to store the paper towel bundles in our kitchen cabinets, instead of leaving them inside the box that they were shipped in.", "These remind me of the paper hand towels you find in common bathroom at a small office.

You get 16 packets of paper towels so these will last a long time. Each piece is 9 inches x 9 inches, so a bit smaller than my regular paper towels, but they work fine.\n\nMy order came in 5 days during the midst of the shortages.

They reported to me that the paper towels did not hold up as well as they need, and would rip or break up faster than what they were accustomed to when we were ordering a pricier paper towel brand. So, I switched to another brand that is slightly more resistant to tearing and falling apart. However, let me say this: I used these paper towels on occasion and found them to be a nice texture, albeit slightly thin. If you don't need heavy duty paper towels, these might work for you. It just didn't work for our needs because we perform clinical services and the paper towels weren't strong enough under those circumstances. Perhaps they might work better for home use, though.", "They are soft, absorbent and a value for the money.", "I normally use Viva or Brawny but during these times found it not economical. The paper towels are very useful and sturdy. Its your normal commercial type paper towel. It is not Super absorbent, however it will absorb small amounts at a time.

It doesn't lather WHICH IS GOOD, people! It doesn't have to lather to work well! It feels very hydrating as you wash, and the smell is predominently a fresh aloe vera smell for those who have had a real aloe vera plant and used it (aside from the very light citrus undertones which dissipate quickly and are not strong because they aren't synthetic perfumes) . It does feel a little drying once your face is dry but definitely clean, and nothing a little serum or moisterizer corrects. I am 30, have never had an issue wih breakouts mainly because I let my face rest: I don't wash it every day, I don't put a ton of products on it every day. I go bare-faced as much as possible and let my pores stay unsuffocated. As a result, my face stays clear and wrinkle free so far.

I can't tell if it is brightening my face, I just like how it leaves my skin feeling, clean.", "This stuff is great for my oily skin but doesn\u2019t seem over drying where my face is completely dried up with alcohol or something. It\u2019s a slippery gel type of consistency and it melts off my foundation. It smells like straight-up, real, fresh orange peels. I\u2019ll lather and leave it on my face in the shower after my pores have opened up a bit and it will start tingling and slightly stinging but not in a bad way .. as if I can feel it settling into my pores to deep clean. I\u2019ll rinse with cooler water and my face looks brighter and a bit smoother too as if it eats a little bit of dead skin off of your face. I have very oily acne prone skin.", "I like this cleanser - it does a good job of cleaning without stripping my face dry. My skin can be sensitive, but i have never had a reaction to this. The gel consistency keeps it on my silicone scrubby pads without falling off into the shower , and it foams up just enough - dense but not extravagant and hard to rinse off.", "I\u2019ve been using this product for about 3 years now. The store I used to buy it from stopped carrying it, so I decided to start buying online. I love this for my combination oily skin. I can see the difference after using it and how my skin looks brighter after use. And it doesn\u2019t feel either oily or dry after use. Skin just feels clean. I have significantly less breakouts now. And, I\u2019m convinced the vitamin c is keeping my skin looking young as people always seem to think I look about 10 years younger than I am. This is especially important to me, because I haven\u2019t always had nice skin. I recommend this to others.

I kept trying so many different cleansers that I finally decided to try soaps I previously used when I was younger with acne. This is a pretty reliable soap for me. Prevents pimples and feels like I get a good clean. It's a tiny drying though, but I have found that's pretty typical with vitamin c cleansers or cleansers that prevent pimples. So I would rather have to moisturize than have pimples. The scent is nice. It's sweet smelling almost like a sweet cereal like fruit loops.", "I Love This Product and it is a powerhouse product.

I saw immediate results in lightened pigmentation (freckles, sun spots, left over pregnancy mask). My skin loves these products. The first time I used the toner, it felt and looked like it was burning my skin a bit so I took a wet washcloth and washed it off. However once the redness went away, my skin looked amazing! I realized that the toner is just really strong, so after that, I diluted it with water and saw less irritation, but still great results. The cleansing gel is much milder but still effective (I backed off the toner after the first time and was just using the gel alone for a few weeks). Since I now know that my skin handles the gel well, I typically scrub it into my face at the start of my shower and leave it there until I am ready for a final rinse. I follow up with the toner when I feel I need it. I have been getting so many compliments lately about how great my skin looks. I am hooked and especially love that it's mostly natural!", "I\u2019ve been using this face wash for years. I love that it cleans my face at night without over-drying it, and I love the scent. I am really scent-sensitive, but the fresh orange smell of this is lovely.

I follow this cleanser with a Retinol serum and the Avalon Organics Intense Defense moisturizer. In the mornings I use the Avalon Organics Cleansing Milk.", "Love the product but when it came it was leaking out everywhere.

I also need products that require the least amount of my effort or time.\n\nI looked long and hard for a good facial cleanser that is reasonably priced. I navigated quite a few bad products along the way, several of which were not cheap. Very few facial cleansers left my face feeling \"Clean but not stripped\".\n\nThis product does this for me - my face feels clean, refreshed but not stripped or dry after. I pair this cleanser with a very light moisturizer and this combination works really well for me. One of these bottles lasts me quite a long time.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that the bottle doesn't travel as well as I'd prefer. It's one of those that you have to turn the nozzle, pumping out the current contents of the pump, in order to lock it. And if you mess-up the first time, you get to pump out yet another squirt while you try to lock it (before packing it in your suitcase). This is the only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5.", "The scent, the texture, the way my face feels (moisturizes, not drying), the price - it all comes together in this product. It works!", "With my combination skin (some parts oily and some parts dry), I prefer a gel cleasner. I was originally introduced to Aveda's gel cleanser which is what got me started on that type. Recently I was using one from a company called Lemongrass Spa, but with it being a direct sales company it was a little pricier that I wanted. And no free shipping...and let's be honest, with Amazon Prime who wants to pay shipping anymore??? So I did a search and found this gel cleaner and decided to give it a try. So far it's working out well. I like this brand anyway, so I am happy to add more of their products to my lineup.", "After much research and considering price and ingredients I decided to order this for my severe perioral dermatitis. I am so happy with this that even though my skin has cleared up, I will continue purchasing this cleanser because it is that good! It never leaves my skin feeling irritated or stripped. The smell is nice and fresh and yes, it does a good job of removing makeup. This cleanser does foam (not like crazy) but it does foam enough to where you feel like \u201cyes I\u2019m clean!\u201d. Highly recommend", "My face doesn't get nearly as red with this face wash as it does with others. It doesn't dry out my skin, and definitely helps brighten it up some. I've been using it for weeks now and I think I'll stick to this one. My skin loves it. I'm naturally prone to acne (hormonal and excess oils), have a good amount of redness at any given time & have somewhat sensitive skin. This feels so refreshing, like my skin can breathe finally without stripping off my whole dermal layer. Like I said, my face gets a bit red with this one but then totally balanced out after a minute. It's not totally moisturizing but it doesn't dry me out either."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001FSWMM", "title": "Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Weight Gainer Protein Powder, Vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin D for Immune Support, Chocolate, 6 Pound (Packaging May Vary)", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/61dIE57qUUL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "62,843 ratings", "description": "Serious Mass is the ultimate in weight gain formulas.

I've decided to 'give back' too and not be so selfish thus, make it a habit from now. What better way to start off than with the products i've used and appreciated so much?\n\n*IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING, THIS'S JUST ABOUT MY CONCLUSION TO 1st TIME BUYERS OUT THERE* BASICALLY ;\n\n1. Be sure to workout intensely (esp. your tummy area) to prevent belly fat (cause trust me, it is real) like the plague\n2. If you find the mixture too sweet for your liking you could always dilute it with extra milk, some water, or anything other thing that works for you instead of complaining & whining about it and trying to force it down\n3. Mixing the chocolate & vanilla flavor (with milk) was something i wish i'd figured out sooner. I couldn't have asked for a better taste.\n4. If you're a hard gainer, you can be assured that this product WILL do something for you (if you take it properly and workout well it would do a whole lot more than that).\nI would know because i'm a serious hard gainer myself and wouldn't even say i 'used it that properly' at all but, in the end i did see noticeable gains and got weight gain compliments for the first time in all my life.\nI'm sure if you eat well, train really hard, and take this alongside you'd be just more than fine!\n5. It has some kind of \"very sweet after-taste\" though, which lasts for some time. (could be up to 12hrs or more) even if you keep eating things in-between or after you take this. What happens is soon as your mouth becomes empty for some time you start to \"feel the taste all over again\". I find it very annoying lol but it's the ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE with this product. I'm ok with any other thing.\n6. Remember to check with your doctor before taking this (if you have any health issues or are on medication or any other supplements).\n\nMy \"testimony\"...(if you're interested) ..\n\nI'd never gained above 5 lbs in such a short time my entire life! I weighed 42kg (92 lbs) before i started my weight gain journey in September 2014 and by the time my serious mass got finished (i visited a hospital in January 2015), checked my weight and it said \"50kg (110lbs)\"\nI'd never gone past 45kg my entire life! Even when i received those \"you've put on weight compliments\" when i was younger, highest i prolly was that time was like 43kg. Because of this i thought there was a mistake in the scales they were using at the hospital two year ago. because at that time i wasn't even taking the serious mass anymore cos it had finished about a month or so ago and i'd stopped working out for about a month or so as well.\nI actually asked the doctor \"um,are.. you really sure it's 50?..didn't it just say that because of my clothes or something?\" (and i'm someone who'd never asked a doctor \"are you sure\" ever in my life!) ... I mean i knew i gained some weight all right while i was still 'on track' with this, but then i knew i'd 'stopped my journey' and wasn't even doing anything anymore so i had definitely lost weight again. That's why i was so surprised! I mean, i had a mirror in my house and all ok?, but i guess because i was constantly looking at myself almost every hour on my gain journey i never actually realised that i had gained!\nIt really was 50kg. I had gained 7kg in 2 months!\ud83d\ude07 (A HARD-GAINER) i want to stress on that again. LOL\n\nI found it really hard to believe so i had to check again during that week with a different scale (for some weird reason i didn't have a scale at home and always had to check outside of the house) lol i really wasn't serious. I checked and got the same measurement to my uttermost surprise. I didn't believe it (still) ... but then after some time i finally got over it & accepted it.\nThat was when it hit me... \"Oh, wow..does this mean i gained even more while i was still on the serious mass?\" ..\"umm.. Huh? \" And then it hit me again... \"this is the first time i've reached 110lbs! ...omg..*my eyes filled with tears* About a year ago that was actually my dream.. to get to 110lbs, and now i'm here! What is this?? How did this even happen?\"\nWell yeah, i WAS extremely confused for a long time. Trust me on that one.\n\nWELL ABOUT WORKOUTs;\n\nI used to do normal 'home exercises' and i never even went to the gym. I had a workout routine, but because i'm severely anaemic it was always extremely difficult for me to workout properly (and the way i REALLY wanted to). So i did basically some 'soft workouts'.\nI didn't have dumbbells at the time, so all i did was basically \"no dumbbell home exercises\" or \"workouts without weight\" more like it.\nThis is why i was so surprised i gained. I realised that if i'd used weights i would've gained even more. I did squats mainly, (different types of squats) and then some donkey kicks and tummy workouts usually. I normally followed \"fitnessblender\" videos on youtube, and then some other fitnessmodels' videos that i found.\n\n*****I bought 2 chocolates 1 vanilla the first time i ordered this product (yes, it was a huge risk i took but this is just how much i believed in this product even before i tried it for myself). I fell in love with it and knew right from the times i researched about it that it was the RIGHT one for me. That was what i needed tbh, and i just knew. I don't know how but oh well, it did pay off in the end so i guess i was just very lucky*****\n\nI never really experienced any form of 'super strength' or felt 'so strong' to do my workouts or anything whenever i used this DURING workout, (and i would not blame it on this because i already had serious low energy problems from my anemic condition), and plus it even says to use it mainly as \"between meals, post-workout & before bed\" in the description (which i did, but also used it as a pre- and during-workout shake as well) so um, because of that i'm not gonna say it didn't do much or help me with my workouts at all. I used it as a pre-and during workout shake mainly because it had creatine and i thought it would help me workout better and easier (But maybe i didn't experience that much of a change in strength/performance because the creatine content is really small? idk) but then i do know it helped me in all sorts of other ways nonetheless. I RECOVERED FROM MY WORKOUTS REALLY FAST and that was an incredible one.\n\nFOR THE TASTES;\n\nTHE CHOCOLATE; wasn't bad at all when mixed with milk.\nI used non-fat milk as they recommend, but then always added some extra cup or so of full cream milk after i got my serving (to dilute it a bit). This was good, i liked better the taste it gave me when i did that, but then the downside was that it increased the amount of the shake and so was always a bit harder to push down quickly.\n\nTHE VANILLA; wasn't bad either. I actually grew more fond of that after sometime when i'd taken the 2 chocolate bags for so long. I liked the taste of that too, but again, it was also way too sweet for my liking when mixed with milk (esp the after-taste). so i'd always add some extra full cream milk/a little water to it to dilute that a bit as well after i'd reached the serving size.\nAfter a while, i started mixing both flavors together and IT WAS GOOD! (i only had a few cups of the chocolate left when i figured this out, so i couldn't do that for long, but then with the few days i did that, i never regretted)!\nI would take one cup of the chocolate flavor, one cup of the vanilla flavor, blend them together, adjust a little with some extra milk, and i'm all good!\n(I always said to myself \"why didn't i think of this earlier?!\" lol)\n\nIn general i never tried any with just water but my brother did once and from the look of things, it's clear they both taste better with milk.\nI never tried mixing either with other solid stuff like peanut butter, oats & the like because i mostly used to blend them with other liquid nutrition shakes (and they always blended well) but i'll try mixing them with dry oats and some other solid stuff this time and see. I'll be sure to leave an update later!\n\nAnyway, to continue my \"testimony\";\n\nIn the beginning i couldn't eat any solid food the rest of the day after i took this in the morning. It filled me up more than a 3 square-meal ever would have so i was always worried i was going to end up relying on that and use that as my 'sole source of nutrition' the entire time.\nGood thing was.. after a while it SERIOUSLY 'OPENED UP MY STOMACH'' and i was able to eat more than i ever could have handled on my own usually. That made me very happy indeed\nI knew it was the work of the serious mass because that was by far the most caloric supplement i was taking.\n\nThe other products i took alongside (more for medical conditions & clinical purposes)were ;\nScandishake vanilla -580 calories\nEnshake chocolate- 600 calories\n(That was probably why i gained so much but i know the serious mass contributed greatly too!)\n\nOh and, ABOUT THE BLOATING THING PEOPLE SAY..\n\nWhat i'm gonna say is it is really true. And i realised it when i experienced it myself. (I already believed and was aware from what i'd read even before i bought the items, but i guess i just didn't think it would be that serious!) lol Yeah, the bloating is SERIOUS as well.\nI had read that you have to workout insanely if you didn't want to end up putting on ONLY FAT so i was already prepared for that. *Only i wasn't as prepared as i thought i was* lol\nBut then to be honest.. with all my 'daily ab workouts' and the like.. i still did have a big tummy while on this mass gainer! lol I probably didn't workout as hard but all i know is i gained weight in the places where i wanted to gain all right, only it came with a lot of belly fat too! I didn't even care at the time though, cause at the time i was far too happy with the gains and knew i could workout later to reduce the belly fat.\nIt was only funny because i'd always been a skinny girl, and i'd never seen my tummy so big (i was actually afraid at some point that it was going to stay that way and it would never go back to the way it was! lol).\n\nI mostly felt 'bloated' and i think it's because i wasn't used to having so much calories in my body. I felt so 'heavy' and 'so pregnant' all the time because i was always so full! lol it was a struggle. But i managed to pull through it. After some time of going off my weight gain journey i got my flat tummy back! :) I know what to do this time if i started my journey again so i doubt that would happen anymore! I will train harder than i did last time so i'm very well prepared i must say. So should you! \ud83d\ude0a\nI would say it was fun though! The whole experience was fun and exciting as i'd never had that much CHALLENGE thrown at... well my body..ever! I was new to working out and all these mass gainers and the like. I gradually grew from there over time.. and now i know so much more than i didn't (two years ago) about mass gainers, workout routines and the like.\n\nI'm still attached to serious mass (yes of course, the love is still there!) and i would keep on buying until i've reached the goal i've always wanted to reach. (which is around 60kg or 132 lbs. I weigh 40kg now, that's about 88lbs yeah, unfortunately.. i lost all that weight in the course of just 1 year and i'm 21 now (which means very much underweight since i'm only 5'3) which is why i'm getting myself more bags of this product)!\n\nFunny thing's, i'm not even in the United States or Canada or the UK. I'm not in a country where i could easily get this product when and if i want. But then i still manage, and do all i can to get it every time (If i told you how much trouble i go through and how much money it costs me every time, you would marvel!)\nThe number of things i could buy with the amount i spend just trying to get 2 bags of serious mass down to where i am... it's ridiculous but oh well, when something's worth it you're never really bothered so this should tell you just how much useful this product is!\nThose of you who can just order it and get it the next day or two (and at this price with no other extra costs), be very lucky and make good use of it.\n\n(I'm not getting anything for this review just so you know, i do not know the company or haven't had any agreements to do this with whatsoever. I took time & wrote this review wholeheartedly just so future buyers would know what a great product this is just in case they were having any doubts) \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFor hard gainers... i'll DEFINITELY recommend!", "I gained 15-20 pounds in a month. No signs of slowing down. I am male, 5\u201910\u201d and have floated around 160-165 pounds for years because of a fast metabolism and an inconsistent appetite.\n\nThat weight gain came after using about one bag of protein powder + regular meals. I use one serving (2 scoops) per day (with a few missed days bc\u2026life), but I use very scant scoops (helps it lasts longer). I *highly* recommend using a blender to mix this thoroughly. I use my simple Nutri Ninja Pro. When you\u2019re done blending, pour the shake in a cup and clean the blender immediately every time to make your life easier tomorrow. It\u2019s much tastier blended with ice (about 1/2 cup) to dissipate the sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s also more refreshing with little pockets of cold. I use whole milk instead of water, about 3/4 cup. Blend in more milk until the consistency is acceptable to you, like a milkshake rather than like pudding (eck).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a heavy drink and sometimes makes it difficult to eat other food, so I usually try to drink just 1/2 in the morning, stick the rest in the fridge, and drink 1/2 at night.\n\n~~\n\nI\u2019m noticing full body gains, but most prominently in my legs (thighs and glutes) and arms. It seems to be mostly muscle. I highly recommend adopting a regular exercise routine, including weights, for the best results with this. I think working out helps ensure your gains are in line with the physique you want, if you have physique goals.\n\nI started doing StrongLifts 5x5, which only requires 3 workouts per week. Takes about 45 minutes and it\u2019s 3 basic compound movements/lifts per workout, done every other day. I swim laps on 3 of my \u201coff\u201d days with one completely off day. So, I\u2019m always getting a full body workout, although SL 5x5 has you squat in every workout, and that really develops the lower body \u2013 and, conveniently, working your lower body enhances the rest of your body\u2019s growth.\n\nDo whatever you want, but it\u2019s nice to keep it simple and consistent.\n\n~~\n\nThat\u2019s about it. Drink plenty of water (it can dehydrate you in the beginning) and get enough sleep. This stuff works well.", "*THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF YOU CAN DRINK THIS AND GET RESULTS WITHOUT WORKING OUT...... READ AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE!!*\n\nI was always at the 150-160lbs range my entire life and looked skinny even though my height/weight BMI said I was basically in the perfect range. I tried eating more and drinking more of these, went through about 5-6 bags but wasn't religiously taking in as much calories as I could to try to gain some mass/fat/weight...\n\nAs the title says, this is for whoever might be NOT working out and looking to buy this.\nTwo months ago I went thru some crazy epiphany evolving ego death and glimpses into the future of where my soul would go if I kept doing the negative stuff I was doing, etc of which I'll spare you the details.\n\nI weighed myself and I was exactly at 162lbs.\nI can't cook for #$$% so I asked my mom to make some homemade food for me that I could keep in the fridge/freezer so I could eat 3 \"real\" meals a day and not just fast food. Being the best mom in the world that she is, she made me 3 meals a day and I would just go to her house to eat most of the time to eat with the family. After every meal, I would drink a full serving of the Serious Mass. I used whole milk, 2 heaping scoops, 3 big spoonfuls of peanut butter, huge drizzle of honey, and a drizzle of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I didn't notice much difference until about a month of doing this. I tried wearing a few shirts that had fit me loose, but now they were almost stuck to my body (but I still didn't have a FAT belly). I did notice overall \"gains\" in mass in my upper chest/shoulders and especially my upper back. Remember, I NEVER ONCE WORKED OUT OR EXERCISED DURING ALL OF THIS.\n\nFast forward to the end of the 2nd month and now I have a visible FAT BELLY THAT I CAN'T EVEN SUCK IN - WHEN I DO SO, I CAN STILL SEE THE FAT AREAS.... Before all this, my stomach was flat and had NO FAT, when I sucked in my belly it would slightly go IN..... NOT ANYMORE.....\nI'M TYPING THIS WITHOUT A SHIRT ON, SITTING AT MY COMPUTER, AND I SEE 3 LAYERS OF FAT ROLLS DESCENDING DOWN TO THE LARGEST ROLL THAT STOPS RIGHT ABOVE MY WAIST LINE. I NOW EVEN HAVE SOMEWHAT OF \"LOVE HANDLES\". I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MAKE FACES WITH IT. I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MOVE THE ROLLS AND MY ENTIRE BODY MOVES WITH IT. WHEN I WEAR A PLAIN TEE SHIRT, MY STOMACH STICKS OUT AND IS VISIBILE (NOT THE ENTIRE STOMACH THANK GOD, BUT THE MIDDLE SECTION JUST KIND OF POKES OUT AND THE SHIRT RESTS ON IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN). I TRY TO INHALE AND SUCK MY BELLY IN AS HARD AS I CAN AND IT ONLY WORKS FOR A MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE TO EXHALE AND MY BELLY JUST PLOPS RIGHT BACK OUT.\n\nFOR 29 YEARS, I'VE NEVER GONE ABOVE 170lbs - I WAS ALWAYS 150-160LBS WITH LEAN MUSCLE.\nI AM NOW CONSIDERED \"OVERWEIGHT\" ON THE BMI INDEX - 30 IS \"OBESE\", MY CURRENT NUMBER IS 29.1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm typically too busy at work to eat properly, so I had been cramming all of my calories in at the end of the day which was causing my metabolism to yo-yo. I was eating so few calories during the day my body was freaking out and hoarding all the fat and going into starvation mode. I now have one to one and a half servings of this product during the day and it has completely stabilized my metabolism and weight. I have tried MANY other products for this purpose from expensive meal replacement shakes (Huel and Quest) to protein powders of all kinds and they have all tasted nasty, caused upset stomachs and diarrhea, or both. I am happy to say this product has never upset my stomach or caused digestive problems, and it tastes so good (chocolate peanut butter flavor) that I look forward to drinking it each day. I only use cold water to mix it since I don't have to mask the taste, but it is more shake-like if you blend it with milk and ice. Great product!", "this product has helped me tremendously. I have an insanely fast metabolism so gaining weight has always been difficult for me. in about a month or two I gained close to ten pounds. starting at 115. two scoops is one serving size but I fully recommend using one scoop (half a serving). half servings are like regular shakes and are much easier to drink then the intended full two scoop serving. a full serving of any mass gainer is extremely thick and almost like sludge. the flavor on this powder is good and only tastes chalky if you don\u2019t properly blend.

You will gain weight doing that, even if you're just having one large actual meal a day, but now I just make a shake in the morning, However I just found out from my girlfriend that they sell one of these for $24 at Walmart so don't buy it on here it has gone up a few dollars every couple months for the last 2 years this used to be $30 on Amazon, don't get suckered in with their inflation prices this is price gouging like when people were selling rolls of toilet paper for $20 a roll during the plandemic.", "I've used this product for around 2 years now.

Not heaped as it recommends, but about 4/5 a scoop to prevent spilling when taken out of the bag.\n-Liquid: I used whole milk (about 20oz. If using less than it becomes too thick and grainy). It makes it more smooth and creamy. Water will work if needed, but I do not recommend it. Lower fat percentages of milk are alright, though the lower it gets the more it leads to my water comment. Almond milk makes it thicker, adds its flavor to it and yet also somehow makes it watery.\n-Blender: Ninja QB1004 48oz blender. Mix for few seconds, do something for few minutes, mix for few seconds again. Ensures complete incorporation.\n-Eating: 35oz is too big, so I pour it into a bowl.

Ordered this and used it for about 20 minutes in tank. Open black water valve let it run. Then close it let it run open it again. Do this often. Beware!!! Make sure you have someone outside opening and closing it. The tank will fill up fast and over flow. You need to shut water off to toilet for the cleaning wand is put down in tank. It forces water out at end spinning. Lesson learned. Do not take out of tank without shutting water off on the unit!!! Works great!!!! No more smell.", "This wand worked great.

I modified the entire thing. my pipe goes straight down, I measured from the bottom of the tank to the top of the toilet valve, then from the top of valve to the bottom of the pipe 17\". the got a 2\" PVC pipe which fit exactly through the opening in toilet so to not disturb the gasket around valve I don't use the shut off valve on the stick, I connected a regular hose nozzle to the stick, just turn it on and use the lock on thing on nozzle, after centering the stick inside the PVC as best I could, I drilled and tapped 1/4x20 holes saced evenly all the way up the PVC 3 at each interval and used stainless s thumb screws, counting the turns to get it centered at each cotact poing just snug against the stick. make sure to use hose washers wherever the hose screws in I use grease on all hose washers to keep them soft grease both sides of washers. once all is centered and screwed snug with tuimb screws I drilled 1/4' holes along the stick and filled with spray foam insulation and trimmed off any excess out the top and bottom at the brass swivel . then paced 3 1/4x20 thumb screws exactly 18 inches from bottom of the swivel leaving the thumb part out from the PVC to keep it from falling to the bottom of the tank.\n\nIv'e read the reviews about not enough pressure, the trick to more pressure, is to pass as much water as possible through the smallest amount of area as possible. I relaced the airater in the bathroom sink with an airater with a hose connector on it, turn off the hot water heater so can use all the water coming in and not trying to heat the water passing through, I even put a shut off valve on water going into toilet so that water is going through the stick and not just running into the toilet serving no purpose other than filling the tank. I also bought a high pressure washer hose which looks more like a 3/8' hose rater than the standard 1/2' or 5/8'= smaller hose=more pressure, yes my swivel did stop spinning one time, but at the speed that thing turns it's going to get hot the water passes through it not around it keeping it cool it needs lubrication I plugged the two holes in the swivel with fresh bread, opened the shut off valve on the stick, used a funnel abd poured it full if 5-30 oil, hooked up the regulat hose nozzle, turn the ater on full blast and locked it, the bread will hold the oil in until the water is allowed to go through.once the water hose is hooked up open the shut off valve on yellow stick, the water will push the oil, pushing the bread out the oil will lubricate the swivel. I've probably used mine 100 times over the years the swivel has never stopped again.I leave the entire thing together in the storage unfer the camper. you'll need a male to male hose adapter to hookthe washer hose to the hose nozzle found at any hardware store for a couple bucks. when you need to use it, simply turn off hot water heater, put the unit into te toilet, screw the one end of washer hose onto the sink and turn bot sides of faucet on, in two minutes or less you're cleaning your tank without pulling any dirty hoses in throughout trailer!\n\nI'd rated this a 5 if Camco could design the swivel to move up and down like a drive through car wash, apparently there is something stuck on my 1/3 mark? when i clean it it says empty yetwhen I just empty the tank it always reads 1/3 on my sensors panel. I suspect the water is just running over the sensor enough to make it say empty but not blasting whatever it is off? I'm now using the detegent dispensor from my power wsher with dish detergent hopefully, after a few uses it wll clean tha spot? will revise this review if it does? the spray foam does make it a bit heavier but it sure made it simple to use", "I had a lingering odor after emptying the black tank on my camper.

The glitter is pretty, but don't waste your time putting the \"garland\" string of beads on.

Quite a bit larger than the other trees (not Christmas themed) we have tried in the past. The package claims it will only last a couple day, but we had ours up about two months.

I mean, I can get 5 cancer sticks (aka regular tampons) at Cosco for the price of one of these. And that certainly adds up over time! But then again, so does the cost of harming the body with all those chemicals. Urggg.\n\nSo I finally decided that well-being was vastly more important than a few extra bucks each month and thus, made the switch these little bullet looking things, which I call 22\u2019s. Check out the pics and tell me it doesn\u2019t look like the bullet for a 22! I got the kind without the applicator, because it\u2019s less waste for the environment and (ok I admit it) mostly because it was cheaper.\n\nI was actually kind of freaking out about the no applicator thing (I mean how gross that I have to \u2026well, I\u2019ll leave out the details). Well, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it took a few times for me to get used to it, but again, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, I\u2019ve found that an AWESOME perk about the no applicator is that it\u2019s SO small and compact that it takes up virtually no room. Stick one or 2 in my pocket on a night out and I\u2019m good to go!\n\nLast thing to make note of... Again, it might be TMI but heck, what did you expect to get from a tampon review?! So before I had reformed my ways and was still buying cancer sticks, it would sometimes get itchy up there in lady world and would just feel \u2026hard to describe\u2026itchy/uncomfortable/not clean. Since I\u2019ve switched, that never happens anymore! Yay! I\u2019m pretty sure it was my ladyhood revolting at me in the presence of such unclean cancer sticks.\n\nI was NOT paid to do this review or given any free stuff. I did it because I\u2019m hoping that more ladies will make the switch. I know it\u2019s more expensive but your well-being is vastly more important than a few dollars. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert ;)\nAnyways, hope you enjoyed the review and that this helped. Please leave comments or questions if you have any and I\u2019d be SUPER appreciative if you\u2019d be so kind as to rate my review :D\n\nP.S. A few people commented about this being so hard to unwrap. They must have updated the product because it now has an easy peel flap in the middle. I took a pic so you can see what I mean.\nXoxo", "Organic cotton tampons are more expensive than rayon, but they're made with fewer chemicals and the fibers cause less trauma to the vaginal walls so I use them religiously. This one is a great product, easy to use and transport, and since I bought a case I won't need to buy tampons for over a year (FYI, I do the same with the Natracare breathable panty liners -- the only ones that don't leave me with a yeast infection since standard liners with plastic build up moisture).\n\nThe case is pretty compact, so storage isn't a problem and I get to enjoy both savings and convenience of not buying tampons monthly. Keep in mind these do not have an applicator, but I prefer this because they're more discreet (I can hide one in the palm of my hand or pants pocket) and also create less waste than the applicator versions.", "I love these. They are hard to find in stores, and more expensive there to boot.", "Love these things. Buying by the case, I can keep enough tampons everywhere and not worry about running out every time I get my period. And theyre organic so thats important to me. Maybe they could be more comfortable but they are perfect for me in every other way and periods just arent comfortable in general so the pros outweigh the cons", "I used O.B. before. Then suddenly that brand became unavailable EVERYWHERE. I hate plastic and applicators and all the waste. I hate the tampons that grow longer instead of wide.....Blah\n\nThese are comparable to O.B.. I did have a little less cramping...but not much. They are a bit more solid....almost to hard to absorb at first...I found that if I loosened it a bit by sticking my finger in the string end and scrunching it a bit, it made it a bit softer and more absorbent right away.\n\nHave switched to a cup now, but still carry these around for emergencies. Very nice product.", "I get these in bulk for my lady and it makes me a hero. Not only do I care about her body I also care it's as natural as she is.", "Item was damaged and received only one pack, not 12. I want my money back!", "These tampons are really good. It takes a little getting used to not having an applicator, but it's not a big deal.\nMy mind is at ease knowing the fibers are organically grown and do not contain harmful chemicals.\nThey can be a bit tricky to open at times, but mostly they are excellent. I also love the fact that buying them in a large quantity means I have plenty on hand and do not have to reorder frequently. Buying the case is definitely worth the investment and saves money.", "I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice.", "I used to be a die-hard OB user or nothing. These tampons changed my mind. They work better and make me feel better using an organic product instead of non-organic that is treated with pesticides. Would recommend!", "Can't believe it took me this long to find these! Only reason I rated them four instead of five stars is cost. Wish they were more affordable.", "My nether parts are much happier with these than with o.b., which has in recent years made some changes to their tampons. The past couple years using o.b. tampons, I've been having yeast infections after most periods, and tampon removal near the end of my periods has been painful. Since buying these tampons a few months ago, I'm not having these sorts of symptoms so far. Planning to try their pads now too.", "No pesticide sprayed cotton! ;) Treat yourself to cancer free coverage.", "ever since I read about cotton being made from the parts of the cotton plant too high in pesticides and chemicals to be feed to cattle, I use only organic cotton for personal items. These items are easy to use, easy to conceal, discreet and effective. I shared them with several friends who didn't know they weren't conventional and never noticed a difference in performance.", "Awesome Organic product without toxic chemicals", "Great product, I made the switch in June 2016 and will never go back.", "I like these tampons for their organic properties, but I just wish they would be easier to open!", "As tampons, these work fine, but it is incredibly difficult to open these. When I'm having to change these, I don't want to spend 5 minutes trying to get the seal open. I've had to resort to using scissors because the seal is ridiculously difficult. It's actually very frustrating and I can't wait to be done with this pack. This is the sort of thing you want to be able to do in and out super fast, but unfortunately not so.

Don't start with a whole scoop! Start with a quarter scoop. Work you're way up. I eat it on buttered Graham crackers. If you put it in liquid it turns to sludge.

I go to the gym in the mornings and also take medication that works best on an empty stomach. Working off of an empty stomach after hitting the gym can be difficult, so I have added this to my daily routine each morning. This stuff isn't for everyone, especially not for people who have issues with certain textures. It definitely clumps up a lot if you allow it to do so and there is nothing worse than getting a big clump of this stuff when trying to pound it down.\n\nTo avoid clumping I use a 32 ounce Nalgene with a lid and add about two inches of water. Then I take a full scoop of the powder and shake about a third of it into the container. If I see a big clump on the scoop while doing this, I break it up with my finger before pouring it in. After adding a third of the scoop I put the lid on the container and shake it well. Then I add another inch or so of water and half of the remaining scoop and repeat with adding water and shake. Do this one more time to finish the scoop of powder and fill the container to the top and shake vigorously. This is the only way I've found to avoid clumping. Adding one whole scoop at once always results in clumping. The clumps float to the top and can be broken apart with a fork but why deal with that when you can just avoid it all together. Please be aware that this supplement has actual chia seeds and various other seeds/sprouts in it that do not dissolve. This won't go away no matter how much you shake!\n\nThis process may seem like a pain but it only takes a minute and makes it a lot easier to guzzle it down. I know 32 ounces of water may seem like a lot for some people but you just have to get used to chugging it down. Don't let it sit too long because the chia seeds start absorbing water and become a little gelatinous. You should be drinking plenty of water if you want this stuff to work efficiently so this is a good way to get some of your water requirements (or goals) for the day out of the way. I try to get it all down within 10 minutes of making it. Then I'm set for the day!\n\nNot only does this do the job in the gut department, it also helps me feel full and gives me a boost of energy that gets me through until lunch time when I can eat something with some substance to it. It also feel like doing this allows my meds to kick in better. I take them about two hours before the fiber drink.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that this stuff doesn't work for them and my boyfriend tried it for a few months and also said that it didn't help him in the bathroom department, but that's because he wasn't drinking enough water throughout the day. He preferred to drink his mixed with a bit of water in a coffee mug and then didn't drink much water throughout the day. Using a small amount of water makes it incredibly sludgy and gross so I have no idea how he even stomached it. I'm not saying you have to drink a ton of water the second you take it if you prefer to use less, but if you do plan on using it be sure to drink lots of water consistently, even on days you aren't using it.", "hope it works.", "This is a great amount for the price. So a really good deal. There is no flavor so I put it in my oatmeal or smoothie in the mornings. It has worked great for me also. It does what I need it to.", "I purchased it to go in smoothies and save a fortune compared to what I spend at a well known smoothie shop", "Took about a week to truly start to work. Keeps me pretty full to where I can either skip a meal and or eat less. I have lost a bit of weight and I\u2019ve only been a few weeks on it. Great taste.", "Absolutely love the cinnamon taste of it!", "I blend a couple tablespoons of this with a little milk. It's healthy probiotic goodness with a lot of fiber and a fair amount of protein. I drink it right away after I blend it, otherwise after a few seconds it starts getting super think. Best to follow it with some water to aid digestion.", "I did not enjoy the flavor of this product. It's a bit fruity and I personally really taste the cinnamon. Just doesn't work for me.", "This is a good fiber but it's too messy and to dense. I found if i waited too long to drink it the mixture would clump", "Pleasant taste, but if you're looking for something that completely dissolves in liquid, look elsewhere.", "I'm trying to listen to my Dr. for a change and I decided to add more fiber to my diet. I wanted to add a supplement and I tried the orange flavored stuff. It was OK, but I wanted something that tasted more natural than like clumpy Tang with artificial sweetener.\n\nI purchased Garden of Life Super Seed based on the ingredients and good reviews and I am very happy with it. Not only am I getting fiber, I'm getting protein, Omega 3 and all the other good stuff it has. I was a little concerned because it had more calories and I'm overweight, but it is actually helping me lose weight by filling me up.\n\nI've also used it as a meal by mixing it with skim milk and eating it with 7-grain toast with marmalade or a couple of scrambled eggs. I love it mixed with milk. It goes down like a bran muffin in a drink. I also sometimes drink a glass with water 15 minutes before dinner and I noticed I'm able to control my portions much better.\n\nAnother reviewer said it is clumpy, and it is, especially if you wait. That is because fiber absorbs water so as time goes on it gets a little thick. The orange stuff works the same way, so either way you have to drink it quickly or maybe water it down a little and mix it up again (or just drink the thick remainder). OK, it doesn't taste like chocolate cake, but it isn't supposed to. I think this stuff tastes great, especially with milk.\n\nI find that out of the other high fiber foods I've tried (orange stuff, snack bars) this fills me up the best and I feel like my carb cravings have subsided a little.\n\nOver all, I feel my energy level has increased significantly and I have much less mental fog. This isn't due to this particular product per se, but it made it easier for me to increase fiber and lower simple carbs like white flour products and sweets. In addition to this supplement once or twice a day, which is more like a food than a supplement, I'm eating 1 high fiber snack bar a day and trying to eat veggies (I'm allergic to most fruits) at every meal for about 30g of fiber a day. I still eat my favorite bad food (pizza and Chinese food), but I am eating smaller portions-- and not because I'm forcing myself to eat small portions but because I'm full sooner.\n\nI feel great and I'm happy Super Seed is part of my daily diet.", "I am NOT a health nut. I am obese and I trying to get my health/weight/stress levels under control. I also do not have any digestive diseases, however I often suffered from significant discomfort from gas, bloating, constipation, and loose stools. These had been a recent onset in the last year or so, previous to that time, I had no GI upset.\n\nI (very reluctantly) decided that my first round of behavior modification would include getting my digestive system under control by trying to regulate my diet, adding a significant amount of fiber and protein. I was very wary of getting a fiber powder because I don't like gritty textures and don't tolerate \"healthy\" tasting items well either. So I tried this in conjunction with a well-reviewed probiotic.\n\nI cannot express to you how impressed I was with this stuff. It mixes fairly easily (only spoon requires), has TONS of really good stuff for you, and doesn't taste terribly bad. However, here are a few tips:\n\nIf you do not like apples AND cinnamon, you will not like this.\nI find it absolutely disgusting when mixed with just water. It tastes to me like I imagine eating water-y mud would taste like (I literally gagged). However, I can use as little as 4 oz of fruit juice and 8 oz of water and be totally happy with the taste.\nIt tastes fake and almost sour if you mix it with apple juice. Orange, mango, and some combination of peach work wonderfully.\nThat being said, I also highly recommend mixing it with 12 oz or more of liquid if your like me and don't like to drink your apple sauce.\nHIGHLY recommend mixing with ice. Even if it sits out in my hand for a couple of minutes, the combination of thick and luke warm makes me gag.\nTends to settle very quickly, so always stir before you drink (especially important if you do water/juice combo instead of all juice. For whatever reason tends to pull just water to top, cause the water/fiber mixture to gag me). Also, tends to get slimier as well when let to sit more than a minute (also something I have trouble with).\nTo get total relief of my GI symptoms, I have to use twice daily.\n\nDouble BONUS POINTS: It works as a superb appetite suppressant. You really will maintain AT LEAST 4 hours without tummy growling hunger.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I can't live without it. Completely made me a believer!", "I purchased this because it was advertised as being good for diverticulosis. I like the fact that it takes natural food ingredients to add fiber to your diet. I mix it with a little water and it tastes pretty good. It is sweet and fruity. The important thing to remember with this is that it is powerful and you have to know just the right dose for YOU. If you just jump in and start taking it, it will deliver a nightmare from which you won't want to take it again. LOL The instructions should be rewritten to start with a very small amount, like 1 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon. Then increase it until you achieve the results you're after. How much fiber supplement you need really depends on how much fiber you have already eaten in your meal. Take this supplement along with your meal. I take it no later than 5 p.m. with my dinner and allow it to work its magic overnight. Flax seed is known to cause diarrhea if you're not used to taking it or other strong fiber supplements.

It's perfect for two people sitting on chaise lounge chairs. That said, there is an issue. The first time I used it, it worked great. Both nozzles put out a nice mist just the right amount. Second time I used it, one of the nozzles would not work at all. I live in an area that has hard water so I'm not that surprised that this happened, especially when you think about how super tiny the orifice is on the mist nozzles. I did find a way to make the nozzle work again. I took a shot glass and put about 1/3 of a shot of vinegar in the glass. Then I put the nozzle part into the shot glass making sure the vinegar just covered the nozzles and not go above the end cap. I didn't want the vinegar to possibly effect the glue holding on the cap. I left it overnight and the next day it worked just like the first time.

It only mist on one side the other side sprays out it doesn't mist like the other side does.

I'm very pleased with it. I tan on my deck, which tends to get very hot with not much wind. This product arrived in an extremely large box but it was packaged well and arrived undamaged. Setup was very easy and the product performs as it is supposed to. A fine, cool, mist is sprayed from each side of the end and it really does make the area surrounding it cooler. My only complaint is that this thing does not stand up straight. It leans over rather significantly, but it still works!\n\nI would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to stay cool this summer.", "One of my friends had one of these and I loved it! She would hook it up while our kids were playing outside on a hot day and she and I would sit comfortably and watch. She would put a box fan behind it when she had parties and everyone on the patio could enjoy a cooling mist. I decided I had to have one, but couldn't find it at any of our local hardware stores. So I came to Amazon, and here it is!\n\nThe downside is that you don't get to pick your color. However, they picked perfectly for me and sent me one that matches the shutters on my house, so I can't really complain! It works very well, is easy to set up, and does just want I want. Putting a box fan behind it ensures that it blows on the right direction instead of relying on the wind. For the price, this item can't be beat!", "A friend of mine was looking for a misting system to leave in her backyard for her outdoor pets during the hot days in Los Angeles. We found this Orbit misting system and figured we would give it a try. It works well and undoubtedly mists the area to keep it cooler. It's a good product for the price. Some of the other misters are very expensive and take some time to install; therefore, if you are looking for a quick, inexpensive mister that works, then I would recommend this product. The only down side is the fact that you cannot pick the color of your choosing, you basically get whatever is sent.", "Granted, you can't compare this mister to those that are more robust and complicated, but for what it is you can't go wrong. We live in the Sacramento region that has very dry, hot summers. We wanted to get a cheap mister that all we had to do is plug the garden hose into... and the fact that this is a free-standing mister (no installation required) sealed the deal.\n\nRight next to the mister (within about 2-3 feet) it is a wet mist that will leave you feeling a little damp (but cool and comfortable). However, just a little further away you get the cooling without much dampness. The less wind, the better it seems to cool, but a slight breeze doesn't render it useless. It is extremely convenient in that it is reasonably portable.\n\nAn unintended benefit of this mister is that the infant/toddlers that frequented our back yard last summer loved playing with the mister... putting their finger over the nozzle, letting it spray in their faces, etc. It was one of the biggest hits in the back yard for play and for staying cool. It has easily held up to the abuse as well!", "It didn\u2019t come with a washer so water would leak everywhere. We used a washer from an old sprinkler that we had and it worked fine. Great for the garden or to cool off a bit on a hot summer day.", "We use this mister (there are only two little metal mister nozzles at the top) for keeping the pets cool in the heatwave months. The summers get very hot and dry and our three pets hang around the cool water spray most of the day. The water hose can be turned on with just a little pressure and works all day long to provide a fine mist from the top. The wild birds flock to get drinks of water from the mist that falls on the grass. The mister we received was purple and the base is a bit wobbly so we have to use something to prop it on one end to keep from tipping; but there haven't been any issues yet from it falling over. The wobbling is the only issue keeping this at 4 stars instead of 5.", "Living in the South, this mister provides relief when working outside in the yard or just sitting outside reading in the summer. Unlike other misters I have tried, this one doesn't leak when you put it on the hose. Some of these products have a tendency to not be able to thread with your hose sufficiently, thus having leaks and wasting precious water. This provides an even light misting to cool you off without getting soaked. The best part is since the pressure on this is so even, once you turn off your hose, it still provides a mist for about 20-30 minutes later.", "Should keep our patio area a little cooler, but I mostly bought it for the hummingbirds I feed. Hopefully they like it. It was missing the washer, which is the first thing the directions ask you to look for. Not hard to fix, just run to the hardware store and pick up some hose washers, but still annoying. That's why I'm taking off one star. Oh, Just a heads up, it comes in a giant box since this product isn't flexible.", "Works great and easy to set up. I had a MistyMate 10 which has 6 (plastic) misters you screw into 10' of small tubing, right out of the box half of the misters were broken. Not wanting to deal with buying new misting heads, I decided to give this a try. This thing is awesome ! Easy to set up and it doesn't use a lot of water. The best part is, its so portable to move it around where ever you need it. My wife uses it when she sunbathes and when she is thru with it, I move it over to the dog kennel. We have used it all day, everyday for weeks and only once has one of the \"brass\" nozzles clogged up but, a small peice of wire cleared it. I also bought some Gilmore Metal Hose Coupling Filter Washers which helps to filter out any larger size debris.", "I bought this for my daughters birthday party. It was supposed to be over 90 degrees and we had a bounce house so I was afraid the little kids would be over heated. We put this at the end part of the slide so the kids could go through it. Definately was a good idea for us! The kids even fought over it at times and it held up fine (didn't fall apart or anything) . Very light and portable. We put a brick on it to keep it stablized but it wasn't necessary. The kids ended up moving the brick and carrying it all over the place anyways. (or as long as the hose could go) I don't know, long term, the durablity of it since I only used it once so far, but it seems that it would last for a while.", "This works pretty well although I have only tested it a couple times because it's not quite warm enough to use it regularly yet. I purchased this to place near my chicken's run to help cool them off during the hot summer months. The only negative thing I will say so far is that it is slightly bent which causes it so fall over- which is annoying. I have to lean it against something to keep it upright. I will update this post in July or August when it's used regularly.", "This is EXACTLY what we needed. We didn't want to pay a ton of money for an overhead sprinkler system and then we saw these. We are in hot hot south texas weather and we have chickens that need to stay cool. I bought two of these and set them about 25 foot apart in the chicken yard. They hooked up nicely, did not leak, good material, and the mist is so thin it did not even get the coop wet that was only 5 foot away. There was an obvious drop in temperature right away. My chickens come out during the day now instead of staying hidden until evening when the temperature goes down. They are enjoying their yard again and I am enjoying my hens again. THANK YOU! Could not believe how inexpensive such an effective product could be!", "Very surprised by this. It is not going to cover a large space or anything like that but if you are sun bathing or sitting outside this is fantastic. Well worth the money. My toddler thinks it's amusing to put his hand in the mist and get wet. So it is safe around kids. Worst thing they can do is knock it over. It's quite steady by itself due to the design", "OG Floridian here, and I seriously can not take the summer heat without this. I just bring it around with me as I garden, or right next to my chair when I'm laying out. Perfection!", "The misting stand is overall a nice item, and it cools off the area, but it continuously falls over and has to be picked up. I have 3 others that are made with bendable material and these don't have a problem, so I think it is just the fact that it is not stable on a surface that is not flat. So if you are purchasing for a flat surface and not a uneven lawn then this would be a great purchase. Also the other thing I noticed different about this one compared to the other Orbit Misting Stands I have is that the misting holes were on the top and the others that I have are on the nose.", "This summer has been brutally hot on the western shores of Lake Michigan where I slip my sailboat. On a particularly muggy Saturday a few weeks ago I ventured over to a little gathering of my dockmates who happened to have a couple of these set up to cool off the guests. It took me about 5 minutes to log onto Amazon.com and get one of these bad boys on the way! As is often the case, my sailing days since have been spent in the mid-70's so I haven't had a chance to break mine out yet but, given my initial experience with the mister, I'm looking forward to comfortable cocktail hours from here on in! The misting jets are adjustable from a fine vapor up to a pretty good spray. Another one of those million dollar ideas that I wish I had! Fantastic product at a more than reasonable price!", "I have owned a mister like this before years ago. I have been looking for one like I had before.

(Male posting review) I applied the Ban powder fresh right over the aroma that had accumulated yesterday through last night...atop yesterday's used-up Axe antiperspirant. I have yet to catch so much as a WHIFF of myself (which is unheard of under the aforementioned circumstances). That, alone, gives this stuff 4 stars. It is amazingly effective, no doubt!\n\nI bought this based on reviews stating that men wear it. I now question the masculinity of those men. This stuff smells like an elderly woman's underwear drawer, magnified by a factor of 10! (don't ask) The sweet stench of baby powder-like perfume encloses me like a pink shroud of estrogen that once was but can never again be.\n\nI fear that the aroma is causing an imbalance in my personal hormonal stockpiles. Testosterone that I had painstakingly manufactured and stored seems to be evaporating into the retirement home-scented atmosphere around me where it is being chemically converted to empathy and a desire to do arts and crafts, to be inhaled by any unfortunate enough to pass nearby.\n\nSailing past age 40, I certainly don't have testosterone to waste, but I am going to give this product a solid opportunity to adapt to my presence... After all, it IS masking the horror of my stench - AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT! But I fear that I shall soon have to scrub it from my armpits with a mixture of bourbon and barbecue sauce and eat roughly 17 lbs of red meat to reset my system.\n\nAgain, this is a HIGHLY effective product. I bet you could sprinkle it in the pit of an outhouse and leave it smelling like a 5-star restaurant (in a nursing home, but you get the point).\n\nSo the jury is still out, but...

How I hated spending hours at a time glued to a toilet, doubled over in severe pain!\n\nUndoubtedly my parents would give me Imodium, and undoubtedly it would help take the edge off the pain and diarrhea, but when I was given the Imodium sure it would lessen up a bit... but it always seemed to drag the horrid experience out longer, just milder... as I grew older I began to notice the pattern, but did not understand *why*... not for many years.\n\nWhen I finally made the connection of FD&C Blue 1 *always* being connected to \"the punies\" including cramping, bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, diarrhea and sometimes bloody stools, suddenly *everything* made sense!\n\nLike clockwork, when I consumed anything with FD&C Blue 1 again I experienced onset of GI distress symptoms. The more Blue 1 that was consumed or absorbed, the worse the symptoms. This includes far too many brands of colorful children's cereals and sugary beverages, sports drinks, PICKLES or PICKLE RELISH, many brands of *white* marshmallows, mouth wash and tooth paste, hand soap and dish detergent, lotion and unfortunately greenish colored Imodium. I was always in severe abdominal distress. Major GI issues. Again, Imodium would help - but drag out the experience longer. Finally I realized the connection.. sure enough, checking the bottle FD&C Blue 1 is listed in the ingredients. Just 1 smll dose has me doubled over in pain.. again.. or worse.\n\nImodium itself is good at what it does... However, this Imodium contains BLUE 1! FD&C BLUE 1 causes severe abdominal distress in a percentage of the population (many of whom have yet to make the connection). If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea, check out the FDA press release stating blue 1 is \"casually linked\" to fatalities they investigated.\n\nParents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...\n\nPs there is hope! Once I learned to avoid Blue 1 (Whole Foods is the *only* grocery store where I can safely shop without scrutinizing every product label!) my life vastly improved. Now I can almost always pinpoint the now rare GI distress to a new source of Blue 1 \"contamination\" I had not yet realized; the latest being Doppler ultrasound gels used in many hospitals and clinics. Now I know to ask them to use the silver packets of clear gel...\n\nSo if you find you are reaching for the green Imodium A-D a bit too much, start keeping a food diary and find the trend, SOMETHING is potentially triggering the episodes.", "We've all taken imodium at one point or another and knows it's an odd taste.

Extremely well built, no cheap or cheesy parts, fit & finish on the 2 units I purchased & assembled were as close to perfect as possible, considering mass production & relatively low price point for this level of quality & sheer mass, a solid strong build with a subdued muscular look/feel. The matte black rectangular steel outer frame paired with the matte finish silver round/tubular inner frame and gray smoke glass combine to quietly match any style audio/video equipment (most are either black or silver, brushed, matte or gloss) these racks compliment the equipment. The glass is thick and strong supported by this steel frame with heavy duty clear rubber/silicone like material supporting the glass to prevent scratching and more importantly to absorb vibration & prevent any kind of glass movement once set in place. The hardware is high quality, bolts /threads line up correctly, all holes are correctly drilled (plumb and square - so many other kits are not!!!) Assembly is quick/easy assuming you have some common sense experience using basic hand tools. I was concerned that the units would not be strong enough for my high end AVR & multi-channel amplifiers or stable enough for my Analog stereo old school Tube preamp/amp & Record Turntable (that requires a heavily damped vibration free surface) - I bought a pair of these racks - one for the AVR/Surround sound system for Movies (Blu-Ray/DVD, VHS, Laser Disc, Cable Box, Heavy 7 channel amp, etc..) and the other for 2 channel Analog Music sound reproduction (Tape decks, Turntable, DVD-Audio/HDCD/CD Transport & DAC, Vacuum Tube Amps/preamps/tuner/phono preamp, Graphic Equalizers etc..) - These racks are strong enough to support the extreme weight & rack parts/materials used are not affected by the extreme HEAT generated by the vacuum Tube systems, open air rack shelf design allows for the best heat dispersion/air flow & because of the rack's overall mass & low center of gravity, these are the most stable/vibration damping racks I have ever owned/used/seen, even those I have worked on located in professional recording studios, weren't built this well. This combined with a fantastic price & free shipping (when I bought them it was free) for items weighing this much - also fast delivery, you can't go wrong. After almost 3 years and no trouble other than removing dust (Good thing the metal parts do NOT show fingerprints due to textured finish, but the glass does collect dust like any other rack shelf surface material). Cable management system is minimal but functional and easily customized to suit your needs, there is plenty of room in a very wide, but shallow 3 sided box that runs the length top to bottom of the rack (approx 10\" wide, 2\" deep, Length of rack top to bottom) with large oval cut-outs in the rear of each shelf, holes have machined rounded edges so no sharp metal to cut through cable insulation & no need for messy unreliable grommets - plenty of hidden room to hide the cable and separate the high voltage Line cords from the sensitive low voltage A/V input/output cables into separate bundles. Since the back of the cable hide is wide open, it is easily accessible & new cables can be added or removed without taking anything apart. The 5 shelves are evenly spaced with plenty of H/W/D to accommodate all of my equipment with larger devices (Reel to Reel Tape, Turntables) on the top Shelves. Shelves ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE - Because the tubular steel framework that supports each shelf is welded - I rather have a strong welded frame, than weak adjustable potential points of failure on an otherwise indestructible rack system. The all Steel inner silver tubular shelf support system and outer black rectangular frame combined are a heavyweight, heavy duty system that is extremely strong, rigid and stable. Because of the size and weight, 2 adults are needed to move the empty fully assembled racks into position, IOW, these racks, even without any equipment on the shelves, is so heavy/stable that you can't move them (they don't slide on floor because of silicone feet, weight, stability) without some help lifting all 4 legs off the floor simultaneously & placing the rack where you want it. There is no way these would ever tip over, they are so correctly balanced that it would take a huge force just to push it enough to tilt it on 2 of 4 legs. I cannot think of anything negative to say nor can I think of any improvements that I would have made to these racks - I may add some RGB LEDs to the back edge of the Glass Shelves to test whether I can get the edges to light up from the front to add some color/focus on the racks - all angles are accessible so mounting LEDs are simple, if desired.\n\nLove these units and would highly recommend..", "This beast is 91LBS and is not something that I am concerned about falling over. I spent a loooong time debating on the benefits of having one of these towers versus using the TV stand that I currently have in the living room. Everything came to a head one day after I had upgraded my speakers and my Receiver went into power protect mode because it didn't have enough room to breathe when it was in my TV stand. I don't have much to compare it to outside of the $800+ range (my father has a really nice AV tower), but I will definitely say that I am pleased with how this product functions and it is well worth the investment if you're like me and need to get something under $300 to save yourself the headache of purchasing a new receiver.\n\nSome notes on the various aspects of this AV Tower:\n\nThe description states that the shelving is: Distances between shelves: top shelf=7 3/4\"; two center shelves=9 1/4\"; and bottom shelf=8 7/8\"\nThis is incorrect. I took a measuring tape to my AV tower and found that each shelf has 9.5\" between them.\n\nPutting it together: I cannot personally say how difficult this is to do. It's HEAVY, but my 110 LBS girlfriend put it together for me and she said that it took her about an hour because she lost the allen wrench and had to tear apart the living room to find it.\n- I have read some reviews on here where people mention that they had a lot of trouble putting the suction cups on this product. She circumvented this issue by using the alen wrench to push the suction cups in. She said that it worked really well and made it a lot easier/faster.\n\nCable Management: This is probably the weirdest misnomer on this product. There is no \"cable management.\" There are holes in the back where you let the cables hang and can zip tie them yourself if you want them \"managed.\" The odd plastic/tie down device shown in the pictures did not come with my AV tower and nothing in the 4 page instruction booklet indicates that it should have.\n- The unit itself hides cables well if you have something on the bottom shelf and use zip ties, or something along those lines to keep the cables together. Personally, I had a decent amount of excess speaker cable bunched up in the back (in case I need to pull out the receiver to work on it or change speaker cable, etc.) and I found that it hides it well due to the low to the ground construction and the slightly tinted glass/Receiver at the bottom.\n\nLooks: As many other reviewers have stated, it looks really nice. It's got a more rugged texture to the black front and back frame pieces than I had expected, but that's not a bad thing. Additionally, the glass is a bit more clear than it looks in the pictures. I didn't really notice this until I had it sitting in front of me. Again, it's not a bad thing, but it's something that someone else might care about. Overall, I think this piece matches my living room better than I had expected.\n\nSturdiness: Here's the whole reason that we all invest so much time in reading reviews. We want to know if the tower is going to break down and leave all of our expensive equipment dead on the floor. I can say that this tower is solid. I have moved it myself and have done so with a friend helping. You would have to throw quite a bit of energy at this guy to force it to fall over. It would be pretty difficult to find a more stable tower. With that said, if you are looking for a tower that has wheels this does not. I currently have this tower sitting on a area rug in the living room and there are no stability issues - despite the fact that my rug has a pattern than includes varying levels of carpet (ie some places it's very short and very long in others) and it's nearly impossible to have something sit on it that's light.\n\nOverall:\nWell worth the $230 that I paid for it. I would believe that this product goes for a higher value elsewhere. I don't often feel that way about the \"markdowns\" that amazon provides, but this product really does live up to the good reviews.\n\nI will update this as time goes by to allow other reviewers a fair shake before they purchase this. Feel free to leave a comment if you have a question. I will do my best to get to it to help you out.", "Just got this for a steal at $152 plus change, after taxes. I just have to say that it's really nice and has a premium look. Was it my first choice? Not at all, but there comes a time when one must accept that they do not carry the funds to be buying overpriced product that's only overpriced to appeal to people with money. This thing looks great. It feels cheap absolutely zero. I would have a hard time being more happy with anything else I can get my hands on.\n\nOn to the infos - I'm not a huge fan of the method of suction cups for the glass. It was a pain for my thumb to go through installing the cups. The very top holes where the top piece of glass goes, does not agree well at all with the cups. Press as hard as you might, it's probably not going to be enough to get them in. I took my hammer, the only practical thing I could find to hammer on that would work i.e. big enough, not small nor too big-a basic black marker, lined it up in the middle of the cup that was already as far pressed in as I could get it with my thumb, and by gently hammering I could get the cup to go all the way in. The cups and holes on the rest of the rig were a cake walk in comparison. Just press in and twist til they pop in fully.\n\n(NOTE: My size is \"football player\" massive, for the record. So of course I have large hands and as a result, thumbs. Smaller people will PROBABLY have a lot easier time installing the suction cups with much smaller thumbs. Just a heads up to not be too scared off about the suction cups. If you resort to hammer and perhaps a black marker or basic pen to hammer on, you'll probably break it like I did. My reasoning for using a marker and something bigger than the typical bolt or whatnot metal object is I was worried about ruining the suction capability of the cup. Use something big enough not to start poking through the tiny hole on the cup and it should be fine to use)\n\nThe second biggest chore was getting the top glass to go on right i.e. straight and even. I'm 6' but I imagine had I used a small step ladder I could position myself above and make a better placement. The problem that adds onto this problem is it can't be put on evenly due to the backside requiring two L shaped bars to connect the glass to the shelf, so you must connect the bars prior in order to correctly install the glass. I strongly suggest leaving the bars very loose so they work with the glass movement, and let them serve as a guideline to how far back the glass needs to go before you set it. No worries if you get it wrong, the suction cups aren't overpowering and you can retry as often as you need to get it right.\n\nYou'll also see four half circle bars which will confuse you unless someone informs you or you research them. Just do as the photo only instructions show. They will be used for attaching the glass shelves to the metal bars to better stabilize them for I guess when/if you move the tower to another location. These and the L bars will have you install a bolt to tighten to the glass for the connection. I suggest you don't over do it. I did it juuuuust enough to not be loose. Once my two towers are in place I will have zero reason to ever move them anyway, but feel free to turn it tight for another round or three if it makes you feel more secure. It is protected with a something I can't really name. I'll just say you will not be tightening metal to glass. It'll be metal bolt>something white on the end of metal bolt to protect glass>glass.\n\nAs usual I am long winded, so I'll end this quickly with - Tower is a 5 star product. Suction cup pains earns it a 4 star rating. And uh, yeah, this version involves dark glass shelves which fingerprints are particularly fond of to show themselves off. Black or dark is great but...might want to consider the clear version so you don't constantly feel compelled to whip the fingerprints off. I just got it but I see this coming from ten thousand trillion zillion miles away >:/ It's not fully blackened glass. It's more like a really dark DARK shade of sunglasses. You can still see through the glass. I am guessing this is why fingerprints show so badly.", "Pay close attention to the weight listed in the product description: this is NOT your bog-standard cheap-ass particleboard stereo stand. The frames are metal tubes and the beveled glass is decently thick -- which is where a lot of the weight comes from. These are why this is a $200 item vs a $100 item.\n\nNo worries whatsoever about this holding any reasonable amount of weight; in fact my eight year old son (sigh) crawled on top. It could totally support a modern TV of any size, though the overhang on the sides would make that a somewhat precarious arrangement if there were any chance of bumping -- usually a better idea to wall-mount.\n\nOne of the welded brackets that hold on the top from the rear was a bit twisted. I was able to bend it a bit, but at the cost of scratching the powdercoat. It comes with lightweight hardware to anchor to a wall -- I think the CPSC has been on furniture mfg's to include something. I didn't use it, you might want to.\n\nThe gray U frames had a couple of scuffs on them, not a dealbreaker or very noticeable once assembled.\n\nThe most awesome thing about this unit is how the hardware is packaged. Anyone who has wrestled with IKEA kits knows what I mean. Each set of hardware bits is sealed separately into a salp-link chain. Moreover each is labeled with the same part number that the instructions reference. No more wondering which screw is which. This is priceless.\n\nThe worst thing about this unit is the packaging. The metal components come wrapped in plastic bags, which is sad but usual, and thin foam sheets separate the sheets of glass. The nasty bit is that the voids and margins of the box are filled with blocks of EPS, aka styrofoam, that are taped together. This makes it impossible to remove the pieces and properly dispose of the box without EPS beads getting everywhere. IKEA mostly manages to use honeycomb cardboard for this purpose. No reason it couldn't be used here.", "I purchased this for my father so he could reduce the clutter of his audio and video gear and have a tower that would allow him to put his turntable on the top so he didn't have to bend over to use it. He absolutely loves it and I enjoyed that the assembly process was very easy and straight-forward.\n\nOne thing I want to mention is that the box this thing comes in is huge and weighs about 90lbs so it may be hard for some people to move it on their own. The second is there is not a huge amount of Styrofoam around the glass shelves and the first unit shipped had completely cracked and broken shelves. Major kudos to Amazon for having a quick and easy exchange process that allowed for the UPS guy to drop off a new one and pick up the old one in just a few days.\n\nThe tower is comprised of a few heavy-duty metal pieces and glass shelves. The assembly process was quite easy due to the fact that every small part was packaged and labeled clearly. A small tool that is included is all you really need for installation though I found having a small hammer around to get the suction cups that hold the shelves stable made the process a whole lot easier.\n\nOnce assembled this tower is a virtual tank. One thing to remember, and they do warn against this in the instructions, is that when you are moving the tower to grab the metal pieces and not the glass since the glass is not permanently secured. Each glass shelf can handle up to 50lbs which should be fine for most audio gear.\n\nOverall this tower was easy to put together and looks good. Recommended.", "An attractive and well-built audio tower. All the pieces were well-finished and will complement even the finest audiophile or videophile equipment. Keep in mind that this is a open-air tower with only minimal enclosure (on the back there is a metal plate that serves as a backstop as well as a cable guide.) This is mostly good though as air flow is always a concern when using electronics and with the Bush Midnight Mist tower your equipment will have plenty of opportunity to acquire cooler outside air and expel any warmer exhaust. Construction of the unit is straightforward but can be tricky for one person especially when joining the four posts and installing the tempered glass. Having a partner is recommended - particularly if you are not a buff/beefy specimen such as myself! (LOL!) The unit is sturdy and all but the heaviest equipment can be handled without too much issue (some of the larger amplifiers and receivers and certainly many power conditioners/UPS units may need to be located elsewhere.) But keep the weight on any one of the tempered glass shelves under 50 pounds and everything will be hunky.\n\nIf I have any quibble with the Midnight Mist is that the metal plate spanning the center back of the unit could have been made slightly larger and with more ports to more easily accommodate all the connectors and cords that audio-video setups can require. But that is being very picky indeed - this is a well-made and classy place to put your home electronics - be it a three thousand dollar Luxman amplifier or more modest components. Regardless of pedigree all components will look good (or at least better) sitting within this quality piece of audio furniture. Five stars.", "We were looking for a shelving unit to hold all of our media components (tivo, dvd, play station, receiver, internet router) to accompany our wall-mounted 60 inch tv. This was a great size for what we were looking for... perhaps slightly bigger than it seemed in the photos, but its in-person impression is elegant and unobtrusive, so the size wasn't a problem or a deterrent.\n\nTo echo what so many other reviewers have said, this is an exceptional product. It's well worth the money paid, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived at our door, considering we live in Alaska and did not choose to pay for any upgraded shipping.\n\nIt took my husband just under an hour to put together, and there were no problems with misaligned parts/holes, missing products etc. as some others have run into. Overall, it's a great shelving unit for a great price. While the openings in the panel to manage the cords in back aren't huge, we had no problem threading the cords we needed through them, and felt like if they were much bigger (as some reviewers have wished), it would actually make the cords more visible, and decrease the effectiveness of the cord-hiding back panel.\n\nWe have nothing bad to say about our experience. Going on two weeks of ownership and it seems to be holding up like a champ with all of our media components stacked in it successfully. Seems super stable and very durable. No reason to think it won't continue to be a great piece of furniture for many many years into the future.\n\nDefinitely recommend this!", "Wow was this thing heavy. Assembly took about an hour, while watching TV. Definitely get all the screws started before tightening them down. I did not, and I had to loosen a few up to get things to align. Once the frame was together you put plastic suction cup things (yes very technical term) on the top them to hold the glass up. They were a bugger to get in. I licked a few to squeeze them into the frame holes. Getting those little suckers in place was the hardest part of this build, but critical to keep the glass from hitting the shelves. Once they were in the glass was placed easily. The shelves are heavy - I never realized glass was so heavy. The top sheet has a couple clamps on it in the back. The TV weight limit is 50 pounds.\n\nI was able to fit a cable box, Xbox on one shelf. I also put some Games/Blue rays standing up on the bottom shelf. We actually bought a second one (off a local trading site), as a electronic shelf for the tv setup upstairs. So, we would buy it again.\nUltimately we removed the one upstairs for a different type of shelf, that would hold the tv and all the equipment, instead of having the equipment next to the wall mounted TV.", "All in all this is a great piece of furniture. That being said, however, there were some problems which are still being dealt with. When the item was received one of the welds on the tubular side rails was broken off. Contacted the company and a very nice young lady promised to get the part out to me right away, which she did. Received the part in good condition and constructed it without incident. Upon putting the unit in my living room and installing the stereo equipment I discovered that the cross pieces on the replacement tubular unit were 3/4\" higher than on the other tubular unit. This makes the shelves on the entire unit look like they are leaning to one side. Makes a great conversation piece but not exactly what I had hoped for. I am still in the process of working this out with the company. I will say that they are quick to respond and are serious about doing what is right. So, we will see what transpires. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing this unit. Just suggest that they measure the crosspieces before they assemble it to be sure they are the same.\nUpdate to this scenario. Bush industries representative has informed me that they will be checking their replacement parts to be sure they are correct and then will be sending me a replacement part, which means I have to deconstruct it and then reconstruct it, after removing all my stereo equipment. I hope this goes better than the first time.", "This thing looks great, holds lots of equipment, and was easy easy easy to setup. It gives plenty of space for each unit and lots of airflow. I needed to get this thing setup in a crunch, I had my A/V installers on their way to complete installation of my audio/video/surveillance system and I hated the rack they \"sold\" to me. I got this thing out of the box, laid out, and put together in less than 25 mins. I had no help (you don't need any). Everything in the box is clearly labeled and the instructions (for once) were very clear and labeled every screw you need in each step and where it went. Each different type of screw was in a separate bag that was labeled. Each metal part, and glass plate was labeled as well. I don't understand the people who said they needed 2 people to put this together. You don't. I actually think another person would just get in the way, but maybe not. Either way, it wouldn't save much time having 2 people doing it. Anyone is perfectly capable of putting this together by themselves.\nTHIS IS NOT IKEA INSTRUCTIONS!!! It is very clear, very very clear. It doesn't try to combine 5 steps into 1 step. Its easy.\nI personally put this in my media closet because I like the minimal look in my living room, but this could look fantastic in a living room.", "I was stunned at how high quality this piece of furniture is, for the price. I'm used to buying small furniture (desks, bookcases, coffee tables) and assembling the particle board pieces, finding creative ways to replace the pieces that are inevitably missing.... I'm sure that sounds familiar for many of you. But this piece from Bush Furniture was nothing like that! The instructions were very clear, all of the different pieces of hardware were individually bagged and clearly labeled, the glass shelves were well packed, and the metal frame pieces are extremely solid and look much more expensive than this tower actually is. Assembly took about 2 hours (at a leisurely pace) and four hands were necessary several times. The only I'd make different is the cable holes along the back panel; I have a power regulator on my bottom shelf (fancy surge protector for AV components) and couldn't fit all of the cables through the organizer porthole. No big deal, though. Plenty of room for all my cables on each of the other shelves. I love the glass top especially - it makes a good home for the record player. The other shelves hold my AVR, HTPC, Wii U, Xbone, and PS4.\nI love this thing so much that I've actually looked up other products from Bush and will certainly buy from them again in the future.", "This media stand looks great. It's sturdy and strong. Assembly was simple and straight forward.\n\nThe only problem was the product condition upon delivery. I bought it in like new condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I normally have no troubles with orders like this, but this had obviously been mistreated. One of the tempered glass shelves was shattered in the box, and the back panel piece had a bent corner on the bottom.\n\nAmazon worked with me, and with Bush to get a new shelf sent to me, which was good of them. I used a pair of pliers to bend the corner back, relatively into place. Since the stand is in the back corner of my theater room, this defect is never seen, thankfully.\n\nAll in all, it's a great stand, but it loses a star due to poor condition upon delivery.", "This audio tower stand is awesome. It looks very modern and it's very sturdy.\n\nThe box it came in was very heavy. I just took it apart in the garage and carried the different pieces separately into the house. It was packed very well and all pieces were perfect with no dents, dings, or scratches. Was very pleased with that.\n\nThe directions were clear. There are no written instructions, just drawings. You just need to go slow, review the different steps first, and become familiar with all the parts and hardware, which are all labeled very clearly. I have assembled lots of furniture and other items in the past, and this was one of the easiest.\n\nEverything fit together perfectly. I put it together myself. No problem. As a few others have mentioned, the hardest part for me (and it wasnt that big of a deal) was putting in the suction cups. I just pressed hard and used the handle of a pair of scissors to help push/twist them into place.\n\nAll in all, I am so happy with this purchase! Just buy it! You won't regret it.", "I was looking for an attractive, sturdy and roomy A/V rack to house my home theater equipment, and decided to give this a try. It was a GREAT decision. It easily fit three 90-pound power amplifiers, 1 pre/pro amplifier and my Blu-ray player.\n\nMore details below:\n\n1. This was big enough to house all of my A/V components with the exception of my PC and XBOX. My XBOX will actually fit if I place it on top of another component, but I decided to have it stand next to the rack.\n\n2. This rack gives each component room to breathe. Each of my five components have good space above and behind for air to flow, which makes me feel better about heat dissipation and wear/tear.\n\n3. The unit looks beautiful.\n\n4. The unit is simple to put together. You will need someone to help you hold pieces in place, but it can be assembled quickly (30 mins or so). It also comes with the tools you need to assemble it.\n\n5. The unit feels fairly strong and the tempered glass seems feels equally as strong. My 90-pound amps don't seem to phase it at all.\n\n6. The back cord strip does a nice job hiding the cords from front views. It look much neater than my previous entertainment center.\n\n7. Awesome value for the price.\n\nWould HIGHLY recommend this for folks looking for something that looks great, is sturdy and can fit A/V separates.", "Being allergic to most assemble yourself furniture, I set out to find an audio rack made exclusively of metal and glass. One that was heavy and stable enough for my vintage turntable to ride on top. This one ticked all those boxes and at a mere $185 shipped Prime directly from Amazon.\n\nAt 91 lbs it's a beast, but by myself and taking my sweet time, I had it together within an hour. Went together very well. No missing parts. I did use a more robust 4mm L wrench than the one included because I had it on hand.\n\nIt's an absolute work of art and the pics do in no justice! I cut 4 pieces from a mouse pad to further isolate the stand from my hardwood floor and allow it to slide.\n\nIt housed all my A/V components with a unused shelf to spare:\n\nTurntable\nPhono Preamp\n5-Disc CD Changer\n1-Disc CD Player\nBluray Player\nA/V Receiver\nBluetooth Adapter\n\nIt does a fair job of concealing wires, mine is a birdsnest and that reflects my shortcomings, not the stands.\n\nThis is a BEAUTIFUL component rack. I'm proud to own it, and I'd recommend it to everyone!", "I received this item about two weeks ago. It came in a very nice, tightly-bound box with lots of styrofoam insulation to protect the various parts.\n\nTook my wife and me about 30 minutes to put together after we got it unboxed and laid out.\n\nAll of the hardware was in the box, including allen wrenches, screws and little suction cups. Instructions, which consist solely of illustration, were sufficient. I'm not very mechanically inclined at all and I could have easily put it together with no instructions whatsoever. However, it is a two person job to build this behemoth because everything but the cable manager is pretty heavy/unwieldy.\nFinished product? Very nice furniture! It's modern looking and the tinted glass makes it far more attractive than your average glass furniture. And it is very heavy and sturdy too - that is something that I have to have!\nThe only improvement that it could stand? An enclosed cable management system - maybe a little snap-on piece of metal or plastic that would completely cover the wires going up the back. I only say that because I hate to manage the cable mess - I just want to cover it!\nThis is my first ever online furniture purchase and I feel that I got a good product at a good price.", "I am very happy with my purchase of this AV tower. I assembled it alone with no problem, closely following instructions which were adequate. I tightened the screws while the unit was on it's side, as the instructions said. When I stood the unit up it was lopsided, so had to loosen the screws and re tighten them in the standing position to get the rack to stand without wobbling - adding weight also helps. I used 2 tiny screwdrivers to insert the suction cups, the rubbery substance being very durable. One piece of glass was chipped along one edge due to a factory cutting problem. I called Bush Furniture, explained the problem and they cheerfully sent me another piece of glass - they had seen this problem previously. The AV Tower is an awesome unit, very sturdy and beautifully appealing to the eye. The sale price was what sealed the deal. Be aware that glass shelves require a lot of dusting and/or cleaning to look nice. I find the width of the wire routing metal piece to be adequate. The shelves are all evenly vertically spaced. I use this unit as an input device rack, below my 55\" TV hanging from the wall above it.", "Well due to the aesthetics and stellar reviews here I purchased this rack and will have to admit for most general applications it is perfect. Great looking quality rack and a good price. BUT for anyone with a true audiophile system or if you are planning to build one I would stay clear. Only after researching did I find each shelf is suggested to not support more than 50lbs and if you are getting quality components most amps will well exceed this number. I know many reviews people have said they have 100lb units and all is fine but being the shelves are glass, all being fine temporarily doesn't do it for me. Two of my Mcintosh Amps weigh over 133lbs and I wouldn't dare risk it. Not that I even had the option to risk it since both of my amps are 9.5 inches high and each shelf will only accommodate 9\" and are NOT adjustable so keep that in mind as well. For one large component the bottom glass can be removed giving a few more inches but it will then be resting on the floor.\n\nIn total great unit for most but make sure of your total weight and height of not just your components now but what you might add in the future. Also really no need for glass shelves since your components will cover them anyway. If this unit had steel adjustable shelves it would be perfect and this is what I had to replace it with. Sadly I didn't not look into these things and with it build and it just wasn't an option to return.", "Well constructed and a slick look. I scoured the internet (mostly Amazon) and this was the best value in mid- to upper-range A/V tower (marked down from $400 to $215). I put my new Onkyo TX-NR809 (also on sale for $499 through Amazon) in the top inner shelf and the other components below it. My center channel speaker sits on the top glass shelf just below my wall-mounted flat panel TV. The glass shelves sit on some rubber (silicone?) suction cups that isolate from scratches or vibrations. They are locked in place with plastic-tipped threaded set screws.\n\nThe top inner shelf accessibility isn't as good as the lower shelves because of impingement by the black metal frame. I had to bring my receiver in through the side. If the unit was a little bit deeper (1-2\") that would be ideal as it was difficult getting all the cables plugged in. The back panel of the Audio tower and the slits in the back panel could be a bit wider to better manage and hide all of the cables from A/V equipment. If the unit had lockable casters, that would be good as well. Otherwise I can't complain.", "This audio stand is beautiful. It makes me want to buy a better looking stereo.\n\nIt's also solid as a rock. I just wish it was square. Quality control needs to be tightened up during the manufacturing process. If it didn't weigh 90 lbs. and would have been a b-word to repack, I would have sent it back.\n\nThe \"vibration dampening pads\" are just suction cups. For the money, I was expecting a real anti-vibration system.\n\nI do have to give Bush Furniture a shout out for cleaning up Amazon's mess: my shipment was missing the parts list and assembly instructions and the hardware pack was torn so screws and small parts were scattered all over the box. I called Bush Customer Service and they emailed me a PDF of the parts list so I could take inventory and recontact them to have any missing parts sent via overnight. Very good customer service."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000W8OWIG", "title": "BUSH BUSINESS FURNITURE Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet in Hansen Cherry", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/9198XbRii3L._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "121 ratings", "description": "Customize your storage with the BBF Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet finished in Hansen Cherry for classic styling with clean lines.

On the downside, it had damage to the back panel that is visible on both sides (see photo taken as we were unboxing the product). After my husband determined that it probably would not impact the structural integrity, we decided to \"live with it\". He put it together and there were two issues with the hardware. The door lock only seems to lock one door, which is useless since the entire width of the cabinet can still be accessed by opening the other door. Secondly, as a tip for others, he said that the best way to install the doors (the hinges) was to remove the adjustment screws first and then slide the door's hinges all the way into the receiving hardware, and then everything should be pretty square and straight if the cabinet was correctly assembled. My only other comment is that a couple of hours after I placed the order, I realized that i had accidentally used our debit card instead of my Amazon store card (my intended payment method) and I didn't catch it at that moment (my fault). So I asked this company to cancel the order so I could reorder again with my preferred payment method, and they said basically just said \"No\". I had also ordered another Bush office furniture piece that was through a different company on Amazon, and they were very helpful and accommodating (quite pleasant). So that aspect compared between these two companies was like night and day. So I definitely didn't want to try to return this one with the damaged part after the prior attempt to work with them to cancel this order. The cabinet itself looks good with my other furniture and will prove to be quite useful.", "This is the second Bush cabinet that I\u2019ve built. Yes, the locking mechanism is weak, but I didn\u2019t buy the cabinet for security. I wish that Bush had included a plug of some kind to fill the lock hole. Assembly was straightforward and relatively easy. It is very heavy, 89 pounds, but it is also very robust being able to support 100 pounds on top easily. I actually had to order this twice. The first time, FedEx lost the box somewhere in New Mexico where it still remains. Bush was quick refund the amount I paid for that shipment. I repurchased it and it was here in just a few days, instead of taking a circuitous route around the western US like the first one...", "The BBF brand is one of the best RTA furniture you can get and super easy to assemble with clear instructions. I have been buying BBF pieces for 16 years and will continue.\n\nThe 30\u201d width of this cabinet perfect as a printer stand with room for an inbox tray on the side. I like this better than the piler piece at only 24\u201d.\n\nThe Cherry laminate of this Series C piece matches my Series A pieces but I prefer the rounded corners of Series A. This piece has right angle corners.\n\nThis has a backside hole with grommet for cords if you want to power something behind the doors.", "Shipped quickly, seems very sturdy", "I purchased this cabinet for extra storage in my home office. It is attractive in appearance but putting it together gave my husband a bit of a challenge. (Could be his skills!) I ordered a second shelf which added more space for what I needed. Why it isn't part of the initial offering I don't know. The lock is quite cheesy and so if you're trying to protect any secure documents forget about it. All you need to do is pull hard on the doors even with the lock on and they open. A few screws were missing but the customer service at the company was great and they sent them immediately. I am overall satisfied with the piece. I guess for the price it is a good addition.", "I have purchased about 7 various pieces this Bush Business Furniture in Hansen Cherry. I am a bit neurotic when it comes to office furniture and I wanted something that would last. It had to be able to take the abuse of well\u2026.actually using it.\nI must say that I have been impressed so far. All of the sets came shipped on varying days from different shippers over a one week period. The packing is very impressive. Each piece of wood inside the box is wrapped in foam and/or foam like paper. One box appeared to have taken a beating, but no damage to the items. Several boxes weighed over 120lbs.\nAssembly varied depending on the item. If it had drawers, it took longer than a desk with two legs. Following the instructions was easy as long as you made sure you chose the correct fasteners for each step. (correct screws)\nThey look very nice with thick laminate and they are extremely sturdy. If you want a commercial grade product at a fair price, look no further.", "This office set is awesome! Not only is the product outstanding, so is the customer service folks. I had a small dig in the top of my desk and they sent me another top. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I don't use the locks, so can't provide info on the issue that everyone has complained about. If you follow the instructions, you'll be fine. Let's face it, locks only keep out honest people. They look amazing!", "Used for extra office storage space and surface.", "I needed a solid cabinet with a lock for use at our church by one of our groups and this one turned out great.

The cabinet can be opened even it is locked.", "We were looking for a cabinet that locked so that is the main reason we chose the Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet. We were disappointed because, although it does lock, it doesn't lock well. To begin with, the locking mechanism simply locks against the other door rather than connecting the 2 doors and latching against something else. What this means to me is that it can be opened without a key even it if it locked. All that is necessary is to pull the doors open far enough the locking latch will simply separate from the other door. This really doesn't help me. For anyone needing a cabinet that securely locks, this is not the one!", "I have put together alot of stuff and this was very easy.", "Heavy-duty storage, very attractive as well.", "Purchased this office storage cabinet to replace a much older cabinet.

On arrival two pieces were damaged and a short call to BBF had replacement pieces on the way that same day.\n\nI recently remodeled my home office and got 6 pieces from this BBF furniture line.

As many others have realized, it's awesome not having the white flaky residue and ruined clothing that I used to get from using the white-solid anti-perspirants.\n\nFRAGRANCE - 3.8/5.0\nIn my opinion I find the fragrance of this product to be almost gender neutral, meaning men or women could probably use it. I'll be honest, my girl likes the smell, but not nearly as much as some of the other products like Speed Stick Gel that have more traditionally \"manly\" scents. That being said, the Old Spice High Endurance Sport Scent can be more appropriate for business environments where you just want to smell clean (like soap), and not like you're wearing cologne in preparation to go out to the club! Also, this product has a fairly strong level of scent, especially right after application. If you or someone close to you is sensitive to strong fragrances, apply a bit less of the Old Spice if you're going to be in close proximity to them for a while.\n\nAPPLICATOR - 3.0/5.0\nI don't exactly love the applicator. Most other products click up in small increments when you turn the applicator. The Old Spice doesn't click so it's harder to know how much you have raised the product since it's crystal clear. I don't want to apply too much so I raise it just a bit at a time and end up having to go back and raise it more until I can start to feel it apply to my skin. This is just a bit more aggravating and time consuming than clicking it up one or two notches and knowing how much product will be dispensed. It's not the end of the world, but it's noticeable to me.\n\nPERFORMANCE - 4.8/5.0\nOne of my favorite things about this stuff is how long it lasts. I can usually go a full 24 hrs and still smell great. This is probably the longest lasting deodorant I have ever used! It seems to have the same active ingredient and percentage as other similar products but it pretty much outlasts everything else I have used.\n\nWASH-ABILITY - 4.5/5.0\nTo me one of the most important things to consider with a deodorant product is how well it washes off my skin and clothing. I hate the products that are so waterproof they don't wash off clean even after a hot shower. Most of the white-solid anti-perspirants are like that, but so are some gel products. Also, I don't want the product to build up in the armpits of my shirts even after being laundered - again, the white-solid products are the worst culprits for this. I find the Old Spice High Endurance to be quite easy to wash away in the shower, and I haven't noticed any build-up in my shirts, which is awesome for such an effective product!\n\nAVERAGE SCORE: 4.0\n\n**** RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****", "The price is Too high!

I received it surprisingly quick and opened the box right away. It was packed very protectively and was super easy to put the legs on. It is a bit top heavy, but, they actually have a chain on the back of it to attach to the wall so it won't fall over. I didn't think it was that bad, so I didn't attach it....but the option is there just in case. There was a faint varnish smell, which has gone away already. They drawers are roomy....two of them are sectioned...the others are are not. The top opens for more storage and has a ring section as well....there's also a mirror.

I believe it\u2019s solid wood it doesn\u2019t feel like any kind of particle or anything like that and it\u2019s very very nice. I\u2019ve seen similar items in stores smelling musty and nasty this one arrived smelling wonderful.", "A little misleading.

I have not found a need to use this feature as the Armoire stands alone effectively without being anchored to the wall. The Armoire has four drawers with plenty of sectioned off, divided space to place earrings or bracelets that you can separate by gold, silver or costume and also has two large, deep drawers that will hold a combination of jewelry types.

It doesn't add any shine to my hair nor does it make it look dull. It allow my hair to look natural and doesn't cause that hardened hairspray use. It also helps to keep the volume in my hair after blowing it dry, although since my hair is so fine there is always some flattening as the day goes on no matter what products I use.

I tend to skip exfoliation because I find it doesn't do me much good. For cleansing it's important that you find a cleanser that is effective enough to remove the excess oil and any other dirt from your skin, but not so aggressive as to irritate the skin. Neutrogena has a good reputation for making effective but gentle skin products and this is no exception. Then, there is salicylic acid. This is a somewhat effective medication for treating hyperactive sebaceous glands, which produce the sebum that can clog the pores, ultimately leading to acne. It's not strong enough to work for all cases of acne, but it's fairly mild as far as these things go, so if it's strong enough for your particular case of acne, it's a good one to go with. It didn't used to cut it for me when my acne was worse, but as I've gotten older my acne has become milder, and it turns out that by using this cleanser every day while showering, I am pretty much able to constrain my acne to a very occasional lonely zit. The occasional zits are small and disappear quickly without becoming big, infected, or painful. The cleanser is an excellent vehicle for delivering this medication to the skin. Neutrogena and its competing brand, Clean & Clear, also make toners and moisturizers that contain the same ingredient. It generally doesn't hurt to use those as well; a little extra salicylic acid from using multiple products that contain it does not seem to become too much very soon. (You'll notice if it becomes too much because it will dry out the skin too much.) I have been purchasing this product and various store-brand knock offs of this product for many years, and it has served me well. These days, because I know I use it anyway, I tend to just order it on Amazon, and get a few at a time.

Originally was buying one for my neighbor, but saw the price was so low and extended so long and how strong does it have to be for some cobwebs? So I got one for myself as well. Extends quite a bit.

That's just silly, and people that leave negative reviews for giving this a hard workout extended to scrub at things, like it's for industrial use, need to get a brain.

Either way the ones I got are perfect. The smell is not strong (I should know. My mother has this coconut butter perfume that is stupid strong and I can't stand it. This is weak in smell compared to that.) and it's done wonders on my hair. I know this because I bought this specifically because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner and it works.\n\nI had to bleach my hair twice and I have since used this conditioner (no shampoo after bleaching) and left it in the 3 minutes, maybe more, to have my hair come out silky smooth. That's saying a lot from me, because I have naturally curly, thick hair. I'm mixed so I've got my fathers hair more than my mom's, but this did what it was suppose to do. It kept my hair from feeling like straw (as it would after bleaching) and it's even worked on the tips of my hair which were really fried after the 2 bleaching sessions. Keep in mind that I shower in the morning and at night (I only wash my hair 1 day out of the week. When not bleached.) and was using this each time as I wanted to strengthen my hair again before I tone it.\n\nAnyways, it does what I need it to do. Keep my hair from looking like a straw man's head!", "I just moved to North Dakota where it is so extremely windy, cold, and dry and my hair is showing it dramatically. I have spent probably $150+ on deep conditioners, oils, masks, anything I could find to keep my hair from being so brittle and breaking, not just at the ends, but even half way up the strand. My boyfriend brought this home off of the clearance rack at Walmart and my hair has never been softer since I moved up here. I wash my hair between 1-2 times a week and I use about a palms worth of this each time. In a different climate, it would probably make my hair greasy, but it has been a life saver up here. I only gave it 4 stars because while this is the best my hair has looked while up here, it's certainly not the forever solution I'm looking for since my hair is still dry, just not nearly as dry as it was!", "I bought this product after reading raving reviews about it online, watching videos and everything from almost every beauty and hair care blog and website out there. They were all saying how perfect this is, because it smells good, because it's so simple and quick, and especially because it's so affordable.\nThat is why I immediately jumped and bought myself a pack of 4 instead of trying just one. Well, that was a bit of a rash decision; the product isn't bad. It really works very well with my hair and with all kinds of hair, it really costs a fraction of the price of most other masks and it's so simple and fast, it's amazing. The smell, however, is a bit of a problem for me.\nI couldn't pinpoint the smell, it felt like it was changing, constantly.\nIn a nutshell, the scent reminded me of one of those bottles of perfume there are for younger girls who want to feel like adults. You know, the colorful bottles, smaller ones, made for tweens, early teens, those bottles that sit next to the glitter body lotions and stuff. Those things have a very strong sweet scent, and that's what this smells like.\nIt felt like I was rubbing candy in my hair, and I didn't like it at all. It's very very strong.\n\nIf you like sweet scents or if you don't mind, I really recommend this from the bottom of my heart.\nIf you're more sensitive to that type of thing, I would steer clear of this product.", "I can not tell you how well this works, you'll just have to try it!! But I can tell you that this stuff is a miracle in a freakin bottle. My hand is thick, like my pony tail is literally an inch, around mid tail, but the strands are fine and I die it, flat iron, and blow dry it every night, so it was starting to feel like hay, just so dry and brittle. I used this the first time, and I noticed a slight difference, but nothing to drastic, but I decided to keep trying, and the second time, my split ends were no longer split and my hay hair felt like crushed silk. By the third use my hair was falling in russet waves with no damage and I was tearing up it looked so good. I haven't had hair like this since I was little, and my boyfriend even said something. (This is the same guy who doesn't even notice when I get my hair cut or colored.)He kept messing with it, I finally had to tell him to stop because it was getting annoying. This stuff is worth its weight in platinum. If you are tired of dealing with hay hair, and nothing seems to be working, give this stuff a go. Its cheaper than most remedies and it smells SO GOOD!! You'll love it, and I'll be your hair will soak it up like sunshine!!", "Love this. I remember using it for the first time a few years ago and I never use anything other than this product now. I always thought I'd have to spend a lot of money for something great, but on a whim I bought this because, honestly, I needed to meet my amount for the prime free shipping.\n\nOccasionally though I'll substitute this with the more expensive It's a Miracle 10. But that's because I bought a 32oz and it's lasting me forever and impossible to finish, haha.\n\nFor the price, this conditioner is a steal. After shampooing and rinsing my hair, I'll apply the conditioner and leave on for a few minutes. I've noticed though that if I keep it on my scalp as well, it'll make my head a bit oily as the day goes on. So I usually just concentrate it on my hair past my head and all is good. I love how it gives weight to my hair strands so that they don't feel brittle and fizzes away in the wind.", "I've been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine. There's a pleasant slight coconut fragrance. My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week. Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy. Often I'll use it while having a hot cup of tea, leaving it on more than 3 minutes in a plastic shower cap or one for processing; uplifting for hair and spirit.\n\nThe formulation has changed AGAIN since the original. It does seem thicker and rinses cleaner with less residue. It's not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it's very close.\n\nI recommend it.", "This deep conditioner is really good. I understand a lot of naturals may not rate it very high because its not considered sulfate and paraben free. however, this works wonders on softening and conditioning my hair. I use it in between regular heat deep conditioning because I work out a lot and co-wash and shampoo my hair more than normal. This is one of my staples and has been a contributing factor to the health and growth of my hair. I've purchased the four pack before and plan to continue as long as it works for me. It may not work for everyone, as we each respond differently to products based on our hair texture, porosity and other factors, not because someone says so. Try it and make your own informed decision.", "I use this once or twice a week, and it makes my hair so shiny! In fact, when I was a kid, I spent a long time in a hot tub that, apparently, had just been shocked with way too much bleach, and my hair dried out so badly that I was considering a drastic hair cut. Like, I could hold it by the roots and all two feet of it would stand out straight! I spent weeks using home remedies and products to try to fix the damage, and nothing worked. My mom had some 3 Minute Miracle, and she said if THIS doesn't work, we'll just have to cut my hair short. I used this ONCE and my hair was back to normal! It's been over 10 years since the Hot Tub incident, and I still keep this stuff as a staple.", "I'm one of those people with weird asian hair. My bangs and top/roots of my hair are very thick and oily, but the back and ends of my hair are dry and brittle. So I've long looked for a product that will help my situation. This really hydrated my hair well and smells really good. I use it once to twice a week to help my hair with its dry and brittle tendencies.\n\nHowever, there are some cons.\n**NOTE THAT THIS IS FROM THE EXPERIENCE FROM MY HAIR AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO EVERYONE**\n- Because of how dry my hair is, I have to leave it on much longer than its supposed \"3 minutes miracle\" (5-10 mins/ more on extremely dry days)\n- Have to use a lot to fully hydrate the hair thoroughly\n- Have to follow with the aussie leave-in conditioning spray to fully hydrate", "I've tried one bazillion conditioners. really. I have quite the relationship with my hair. No matter what I do, I keep coming back to the 3 minute miracle. Some one left a bottle at my house by accident, didnt need it back, so I plopped it on, not expecting much. That was 5 years ago, at least. I buy it in bulk. If anyone knows of a conditioner that gets tangles out as easily as this cheap stuff does, I am always willing to try it, but nothing in my opinion comes close to this. Really.", "I do not scrimp on hair products- at 50 plus, my not-yet-gray hair is the youngest looking thing I have going. So I use Fekkai shampoo, Goldwell's leave-in serum, & a Malibu de-mineralizer once a week to abate the effects of well-water.\n\nBut when it comes to an everyday conditioner, you can't beat \"Aussie Moist 3 Minute Miracle\"- even at many times the price. I've tried many upscale & salon brand conditioners over the years, but always go back to this stuff. It really is a bit of a \"miracle.\" You can feel split rough ends (from heat styling, etc.) resolve in the time it sits on your locks. As you rinse, smoothness reigns again.\n\nGive it a try & you, too will be buying the 4-packs & 6-packs offered here on Amazon.", "I have used this conditioner for about 3 months now after switching from Infusium 23 Moisture brand. I like this conditioner a lot better. My hair is fairly curly and has some frizz to it so I was looking for something that would help weigh it down. This does just that, after the 3 minute wait, the conditioner rinses with no oily or other residue. After drying and applying some other leave in product my hair feels and looks great. After using this I use less of my leave in product, and it seems to thicken and weigh my hair a little which gives me a better handle on the curls. Highly recommended!", "I'm always looking for the holy grail of hair conditioners, so I can't tell you how many different ones I've tried over the years, but it must be dozens and dozens. And I always keep coming back to this one, because it does the trick for my fine, dry hair. I don't know why I stray...why I imagine that there's anything better, I should know by now that there isn't. And you sure can't beat the price. It makes my hair soft and silky, without weighing it down. It's worth the three minutes!", "Literally a Miracle.\nMy hair is dull, dry, split, and falling out from years of dyeing and a recent harsh bleaching. This product is AMAZING. In just 3 minutes my hair had so much more moisture. It was incredible. I bought the 3-pack of this and I am so glad I did. This along with a few other Aussie products I've ordered (Hair Insurance Split End Protector; Smooth N' Bloom Conditioner) has improved the health of my hair tremendously.\n\nI absolutely ADORE this product and WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. It's a real life saver. You have to try it to believe!", "I have the stupidest hair texture. I have curls but they're not pretty, they just look deformed mostly. I have to either straighten my hair or look like a wreck. My hair is a frizzy, huge mess that can't be controlled by much. This stuff is the best product I've used to get more softness and smoothness to my hair. I LOOOVE it. I really do. I bought the four pack and will again as soon as I run out. It surprisingly lasts a long time even though I have thick, long hair and use globs of the stuff!", "I am relaxed and have been on my healthy hair journey about 18 months now. Although I have solidifed most of my staple products I have never been happy with any of my conditioners ranging from both high end and low end products. Aussie is my new staple. I love how thick it is, and I love how moisturized my hair feels after just 3 min. I leave it on a little bit longer as I do my other shower rituals and my hair loves it! Detangling is a cinch! I dont really care for how the bottle is made, but not a huge deterrance for me. This product is a welcomed staple in my reggie!", "After years of torturing my hair with chemicals, I didn't know what to do with my hair. I accepted it's fate as a dry, frizzy exchange for a broom. Then suddenly I tried this product....\n\nMy hair started singing! Okay maybe not literally.

I am sold on this product for life. I'm never using any other conditioner again!", "I'm a guy and I've been using this conditioner for years now, still giving me the results from day one: soft and silky hair! This is perfect for a daily conditioner and works as a hair mask if you leave it in longer.

I would have liked a farther away expiration date.", "We are BIG into natural living, so I was NOT one who wanted to whiten our teeth using unsafe ingredients. The ingredients in these are overall pretty decent, EXCEPT the SACCHARIN.\n\nThat said, we had a dentist recommend we whiten one of our teen's teeth BEFORE braces because they said if we whiten AFTER braces, they would have to REMOVE & REPLACE any fillings in the teen's teeth because the fillings would be the color of her teeth that were stained from silent reflux due to hiatal hernia issues caused by a tongue tie, as well as her lips & buccals were also tied, causing the dental issues.\n\nWe did NOT want to have to have her fillings redone for several reasons, so we decided to try the home whitening. I was NOT happy that there is saccharin in them as it is TOXIC, but I felt I had to compromise because I felt 14 days of saccharin on her teeth for 30 minutes, would be less harmful than having to replace the fillings that would be in her mouth for several years, not to mention that every time a filling is redone, part of the natural tooth structure is removed even further, & we felt that was the greater risk long term.\n\nAfter reading countless reviews on several listings for the Crest strips, I decided upon these ones. I saw \"professional\" ones that were pricier & I was going to buy them, UNTIL I saw the reviews that said the strips were dried out, the boxes came empty, etc. I also considered the ones for SENSITIVE teeth, but was concerned they would not whiten quickly enough, as some reviewers had stated. These ones said \"professional effect\" so I decided I would go for it after reading the reviews.\n\nWe are SO happy with them!\n\nOur teen used these for 14 days, 30 minutes each time, daily. She brushed her teeth before (she did not see the note on the box that says to avoid brushing right before) & rinsed with a Waterpik after to get the stuff off her teeth thoroughly.\n\nWe were THRILLED that when she went for a filling on day 14 to repair some damage due to the ties & using straight charcoal powder on her teeth (UNBEKNOWNST to me!), her teeth were as white as they could be (B2) without heavy duty professional whitening. The DENTIST was VERY happy with the results as well.\n\nWe are VERY pleased & did not realize how much the silent reflux (which we did not know was happening) had impacted the color of her teeth. Her teeth are SO white now & ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!\n\nWe are now going to buy strips for our other teens & tween to use, because they also had silent reflux until they had their unknown tongue, lip, & buccal ties released recently. Their teeth are nowhere near as stained & our one teen's were, so I am not sure if their teeth will be as white as our one daughter's are after using these strips, but I want to let them try.\n\nOur teen is SO much more CONFIDENT now & smiles SO much. She was NEVER bothered by her teeth before, but I think that now seeing them look so absolutely BEAUTIFUL, has helped her teeth to look as great as she now feels after having her ties released, & her airway expansion in progress. Had I known her teeth were so stained, I would have used these sooner.\n\nAfter I get my kids' teeth done with these strips, I may splurge on some for me too.\n\nI WOULD purchase these again & have purchased them for my other kids now.", "If I use more than once a week my teeth become sensitive.", "As a person that consumes large amounts of coffee and tea, keeping my teeth white has been an ongoing struggle that has prompted me to buy just about every whitening product available. Every time Crest comes out with a new Whitestrips product I give it a try. Many have been disappointing, and all have proven to be a somewhat unpleasant chore to use. Now I understand that doing something to make your teeth whiter is worth some time and effort, but using the Crest Whitestrips is usually a messy, uncomfortable process that I have always dreaded. Still, I have always been able to get noticeable results so I continue to use them nonetheless. Until recently I was getting the best results from using the Crest Whitestrips Pro Effects 10-day System. However, those strips still tended to slide around on my teeth and required that I keep my mouth closed for the entire treatment.\n\nIn February I was given the opportunity to try the new Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips kit. It is certainly a big improvement over the other Whitestrips products. The Advanced Seal kit only requires a 30 minute treatment once a day, whereas the rest of the Whitestrips product line requires two 30 minute treatments each day. The entire kit lasts for 14 days, but it promises that you will see results within 3 days. The kit contains 14 packets, each packet containing an upper and lower whitening strip. Each strip is coated with a peroxide-infused gel, which is claimed to mold and adhere to teeth better that any previous Whitestrips product. Crest also notes that this product will only work on natural teeth, and will NOT whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings, or dentures. These Whitestrips should not be used by anyone under the age of 12, and should not be used on teeth with braces. Crest even claims that you can drink water while whitening your teeth with this product.\n\nHere is the 3-step method for using this product (taken directly from the Crest website):\n\n1. Peel:\n- For best results, do not brush teeth immediately before applying strips.\n- Open foil pouch and remove.\n- Peel strips from backing.\n2. Apply:\n- Apply gel side of strip to teeth. It will instantly mold and adhere to teeth.\n- Align strips with gum line and press gently for good contact.\n- Fold the rest of strip behind teeth to keep in place.\n3. Reveal:\n- Wear strips for 30 minutes once a day, remove and discard.\n- Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal comes off cleanly.\n\nAfter using this kit for the full 14 days, here is what I have personally experienced:\n\nFirst of all, the claim by Crest that these strips hold much better to your teeth is true. In fact, when trying to remove these strips some may feel that they hold TOO good. I have found that removing them can be a somewhat difficult and messy task. After being in your mouth for 30 minutes the strips are rather slimy and slippery, so I have learned to pull one end loose and then use a tissue to pull the strip off my teeth. You really have to tug pretty hard in order to get these strips off from your teeth! Second, the strips still leave some unpleasant residue on your teeth, so you will want to make sure to brush right after removing the strips. Third, the strips are still a little bit of a pain to apply. It's hard to fold them over your teeth without getting creases in them. But, the fact that they hold strong is a great thing. They hold on tight for the full 30 minutes, and therefore don't slide around on your teeth like the previous Whitestrips did. I don't experience the excessive amount of saliva generated by the previous Whitestrips products either. Although some folks do experience a mild amount of increased sensitivity after repeated use of this product, I was able to complete the full 14 treatments (without skipping a day) without any discomfort whatsoever. These Advanced Seal Whitestrips are a great improvement in design, and they are ultimately much easier to use. I definitely notice that my teeth appear whiter within 2 to 3 treatments, and by the end of the 14-day treatment my teeth looked wonderfully bright.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with the improved design and excellent results provided by the Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips product. They're not completely perfect, and they are still a bit of a chore to apply, use, and remove. But when all is said and done these strips are definitely the best effort produced by Crest yet. If you are looking for whiter, brighter teeth, and don't mind a 30 (35 minutes including removal and brushing afterward) minute inconvenience for 14 days, I highly recommend the Advanced Seal Whitestrips system from Crest. Shop around though, because they can be found much cheaper on the Internet than in local retail stores. I have found them nearly twenty dollars cheaper on sites like Amazon than what they sell for in brick and mortar stores. In these tough economic times it is always good to save a few bucks whenever possible. After all, paying more for the same product is not going to get your teeth any whiter. =o)", "Excellent purchase!!", "After completing the treatment I felt like they did whiten my teeth a lot. However, I would look at myself in different mirrors and lightning and not see the results as much. I do believe they work but I also have a couple of stains from when I had braces that did not go away. In my case, I am going to need a professional whitening treatment to achieve the results that I want.", "These work well", "Teeth Whitening, easy to use...", "Being a true Brit I have (had) quite yellow, stained teeth. One of my front teeth is a little crooked and I\u2019m not a big fan of braces to fix something so minor, but a few years ago a friend suggested that whitening my teeth would make the wonky tooth look less weird. In my teen years I tried lots of cheap messy gel products from eBay and none of them had any qualities that made me want to continue use, least of all any whitening effect.\n\nRoll on a few years later; I\u2019m in my late twenties, a mother and looking to step up my career a little. I look in the mirror and I\u2019m happy, but I could tweak a few things and feel 10x better about \u2018Me\u2019. So with this time money being only a small factor in my endeavours, I decided to do some research on whitening procedures offered by Dentists in the UK. After a few weeks of comparisons and consulting forum after forum online I came to the conclusion that going down the bonafide dentist route would be more costly than expected and no guarantee I wouldn\u2019t be in sensitive agony.\n\nBut, Crest Whitestrips seemed to be the next best thing. Only downside is you can\u2019t get them in the UK. Good job that Amazon.COM will ship to my UK address \u2013 Awesome!\n\nHaving read up a lot on how to combat the sensitivity issues I took the initiative to purchase some sensitive toothpaste and mouthwash to start using prior to picking a whitening treatment. The more I could do to prevent sensitivity the better. I began the strict regime of twice daily brushing, flossing in the evening and mouthwash about 4 weeks before I put anything on my teeth. Bear in mind that I was a brush once a day gal before I started this and a lot of my back teeth have amalgam fillings. I even have a filling in the back of my front tooth, I was not kind to my mouth at all!\n\nI ordered a sample kit from a UK based website initially before taking the plunge on a full 14 treatment pack from Amazon.com. I got 7 treatments of the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 variety and figured I\u2019d see if I liked those first.\n\nI saw results after the first 2 strips. It was amazing. They stuck to my teeth so well and gave full coverage for my smile. Because of this I purchased a 14 pack of the \u2018Glamorous White\u2019 variety and followed the tracked package from the USA, to the UK, through Customs and to my door. It arrived 1 week earlier than expected. Happy days.\n\nSo I\u2019d used up my 7 \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 and began on the \u2018Glamorous White\u2019 as soon as they arrived. They stick to your teeth beautifully, though in the instructions it doesn\u2019t tell you to dry your teeth, I always find they adhere a lot better if you do. Sitting for 30 minutes with them in your face is a breeze, I tend to do housework or sit down for half an episode of Scandal\u2026..usual mummy things.\n\nThe picture attached to my review speaks for itself, this is from before using 7 \u2018PE\u2019 strips and then 7 Glamorous White strips (half of my purchase from here). My results have been fantastic, and in only ten days! And ZERO SENSITIVITY! *high five*. And I\u2019ve got another 7 treatments to go if I want to, or save them for top ups.\n\nI\u2019ve marked this item as 4 out of 5 because it misses the direction of drying your teeth before applying them, there is some confusion around how many times you can have a treatment per day and because the bottom strip is a lot smaller than the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 version. The \u2018PE\u2019 ones cover my whole bottom smile which is about 8 teeth left to right. With this one I get just about coverage for 6 so if I\u2019m honest I wouldn\u2019t buy these again purely for that reason.\n\nIn terms of daily application I go with two as the maximum, not because I have any sensitivity but just because an hour of my day is all I\u2019m prepared to give up to this at the moment.\n\nI\u2019m at the stage where I want to get to a satisfactory white and then just maintain it from there. I\u2019m confident I can do that using Crest products, but it will most likely be the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 as overall I find them to be the superior version.", "Easy to use.!", "1000/10", "It does the job", "Aclara los dientes efectocmenete muy r\u00e1pido pero el dolor de la sensibilidad es muy fuerte", "I will start by saying that although I was expecting some sensitivity issues (I read a lot of reviews...) there has been none until now. I did start brushing with Sensodyne Rapid about two weeks before starting the white strips, and I continue to brush with it right after I remove the strips. I have also been using Sensodyne Protect & Repair with Novamin. I just removed my 4th pair of strips and to be honest I don't see a difference... My teeth are still as yellow as before. I don't smoke or drink coffee/wine, so I guess it's just the quality of my enamel. I really was not expecting a drastic change, but after 4 treatments I thought there would be a little improvement.... I don't know, should I still be hopeful? Now, about the infamous bottom strip: dear sirs at Crest, the bottom strip in the Advanced Vivid is ridiculously small! I mean, seriously, who wants to have six beautiful whitened teeth sitting right next to two or three yellow ones?? It shows! No one has such a small mouth. I had to use one packet of strips just to cut into pieces so I could cover the other teeth, which in my case are the darker ones. So, I'm already down one treatment. Other than that, the advanced seal works very well, the strips are easy to apply and remove and leave no taste in my mouth. No sensitivity in the gums either. Now my question is what white strips version should I try in case these do not work at all, and how long should I wait inbetween treatments? I would really like to get rid of some of this yellowing... Can you help me Crest? I will come back and update this review towards the end of the treatment. Keeping my fingers crossed!\n\nEdit\nDay 5: I left the strips on for one hour this time, although it is not recommended and Crest does say the product won't whiten past the recommended time. Sure enough I still can't see any real change in shade. The teeth look whiter right after I remove the strips, but after a few seconds the color is back to normal. I did experience a few twinges on my teeth about 8 to 10 hours after this treatment, nothing painful, just weird. I guess leaving the strips for longer than recommended does improve your chances of getting sensitivity. Still not impressed.\n\nEdit\nDay 6: this time I went back to the recommended 30 minutes routine and the slight sensitivity didn't come back. I have finally started to notice a difference in teeth shade, they are not much whiter (maybe one shade whiter) but they are definitely brighter! Also I went to the dentist and had them professionally cleaned, I hope that helps a little with the process.\n\nEdit\nResults! I can now say that my teeth are much whiter and I am so pleased! Still a few days to go so it can only get better. It took me about six days to really start seeing a difference but these actually really work, it's worth the wait. I'm rating these strips 4 stars just because of the size of the bottom strip. Other than that they work great and gave me no pain or discomfort.", "so I never had whitened my teeth before (other that the 4 times I used a charcoal activating toothpaste) and I thought this would be a scam, but my brother had some yellow teeth and then he surprised me one day with a white smile. For him, this would be worth the 5 stars! I was blown away but I still didn't try it. I kept putting it off but I wish I had done it sooner.\n\nMy teeth were off white. I don't smoke, but I think drinking coffee and skipping out on flossing caught up with me that there was a slight yellowish tint in some lighting but it was only noticeable to me. I have small teeth and big cheeks so usually when I smile and talk you only see my top teeth, which is good because I have a chipped tooth at the bottom.\nAnyway, I am graduating college soon and had to take some pictures so I finally remembered that I wanted to give this a try.\nI feel more confident when I smile now but here's the issue.\nThe bottom strip is not the same size as the top strip so the bottom strip did not give as great of coverage as the top strip. It also slipped off; whereas, the top strip was perfect at sticking on to your teeth. Crest should consider just giving 2 top strips and I'm surprised they have not done so seeing how people have been making this complaint for over a decade.\nThe change on my teeth were not as dramatic a change as my brother's. I was hoping it would be lifted 2 more shades but still I am very impressed with my top teeth. My bottom teeth kinda look the same from day 1.\nIt is still well worth the $ to feel confident when you smile.\nI plan on buying them again in a few months. Also most days I did not get a zing sensation (you get it from having sensitive teeth) but the days that I left the strips on for too long I did feel it. If I felt a zing, I'd wait a few days before putting in the next strip.\n\nI took some pictures of my teeth to show the transformation. I think the teeth look really good in sunlight but under certain lighting like white lights- not as great. if you are debating this, don't overthink it. Give it a try! :D", "these were my first experience with teeth whitening strips and i think they\u2019re pretty good. they make my teeth a little sensitive but they do whiten quite nicely. the taste is bad though it\u2019s not intense but it\u2019s definitely not what i especially, like it kinda tastes dangerous but i haven\u2019t experienced any poor health from it.", "I love using these!\nOkay, so lots of people have commented on how these can increase your sense of sensitivity and it has a nasty taste in your mouth--I'm going to be honest: I don't really taste anything. It says not to swallow anything so maybe someone accidentally swallowed some and it was gross? Idk. And as far as sensitivity goes, I have sensitive teeth anyways so I was SUPER nervous about using these but I took a risk, and I've continued using my normal toothpaste: Crest's Whitening Therapy toothpaste that also helps majorly with sensitivity. I don't know if it is the toothpaste that helps but I haven't felt an increase in sensitivity. :)\nIf you have problems with sensitivity but want to whiten your smile, my Dentist told me (I had previously asked for advice on using these strips) to decrease how often you leave them on and for how long. If you feel any weird tingling or pain while the strips are on after a bit, take them off and try again the next day or the next. Totally up to you how long you use it. JUST DON'T FALL ASLEEP WITH IT IN!! I don't know what happens but it's all over the instructions as a warning. haha\nAlso another thing, in the instructions (You can tell I was worried about using these haha) it mentioned to avoid brushing your teeth right before you use the strips. It didn't explain why so I either just do it at the end of the day or wait a while after brushing my teeth, like 30 minutes to an hour if you can. And I always brush my teeth after-cuz the whitening gel is all over your teeth and it feels gross and weird so I rinse first and then brush my teeth after a few minutes--I don't want to immediately brush off what I want to whiten my teeth!\nAnd I know everyone's been putting up BEFORE and AFTER photos of their teeth. Well I totally blew it I didn't take a before picture... But I'm getting married in June so the real test is if my smile will match my dress!! *Fingers crossed!!*\nGood luck on your adventures!\n\nOH I ALMOST FORGOT!\nSo children: It disclaims in the package instructions that white spots could appear or stains on your teeth could brighten temporarily.\nLet me emphasis the word: TEMPORARILY. TEMPORARILY. I have small lines on my teeth from braces (I wasn't a diligent brusher at 12 years old) and they brightened for like a day. I used it again (I do every other day) and they weren't as bright. So DO NOT WORRY if you experience similar results. Keep calm and keep on whitening. :)", "These strips have definitely whitened my teeth. My wife and other members of my family all use them too.", "YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY THESE WHITESTRIPS IF YOU REALLY WANT WHITER TEETH. Don't whine about sensitivity, it says right on the box that it can happen. I had no issue with the \"goo\" on these bleaching my clothes or fingers. They only became gooey when I removed them from my teeth.\n\nI had been thinking about whitening my teeth for awhile -- I had the Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening kit, but that thing TORE MY GUMS UP. It did whiten my teeth slightly though, but not worth the $50 and the pain. I asked my dentist about getting professional whitening, but he said it's basically the same thing as everything out on the market that has a tray (like the rembrandt kit), just wildly more expensive (I love his honesty).\n\nI had the old whitestrips from about 3 years ago -- they didn't do too much for me. I got this new set of Crest Whitestrips in a fit of optimism. The shipping took a little longer than most stuff I get from Amazon, but nothing outrageous. The packaging was nothing to hoot at (mine came wrapped in the Classifieds section in a manila envelope, the box was a little crushed, but the innards were fine).\n\nI read the instructions, and DID NOT brush my teeth beforehand, and slapped those suckers onto my lower and upper teeth. I like these better than the old whitestrips, they aren't gooey and slippery like the old ones. They're more a tacky feel, like they get sticky only when they get wet, so you can readjust them without them sliding all over your mouth. I do have a fairly wide smile, and the upper strips cover just about all of it, and the lower ones cover about 6 of my teeth. These don't taste as bleachy as the old ones, and they didn't irritate my gums AT ALL either.\n\nI've been using them every other day to cut back on the risk of sensitivity (but I fell asleep with them on one day, which you're NOT supposed to do - so i ended up leaving em on for like 2 hours instead of just 30 minutes, so I had some sensitivity after that session that faded eventually). I noticed a visible difference in the shade of my teeth within 3-4 treatments and I think i still have about 5 packets left. My teeth are pretty white now, but not unnaturally white (by unnatural, i mean like Ross in that episode of Friends where he dates the girl with the blacklight). My teeth aren't paper-white, but let's be honest -- that would be creepy. The walls at my job are a pale cream color, and my teeth are now whiter than the walls.\n\nThe only thing that could make these better is if they paid my bills and told me they loved me once in awhile.\nOh, and maybe included a whitening scale, so that you could compare your teeth when you start to when you finish.", "After using the 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips, I saw an improvement in the color of my teeth after just four uses. This is a great product, and after my order runs out in five days, I will more than likely request a second box from Amazon. However, before you order this product, there are a few things that you need to consider.\n\n1.) Though this product works, it is nothing special. This whitening device is simply an adhesive strip of peroxide that bonds firmly to your teeth, and you can get the same whitening result by rinsing your mouth daily with hydrogen peroxide from the grocery store.\n\n2.) If you have a peroxide sensetivity, stay away from this product. Some people experience a burning sensation on their gums during usage, so I recommend rinsing with regular household peroxide to test your sensetivity before you spend $20-$30 on these whitestrips.\n\n3.) As Crest promises, these whitestrips DO NOT slip off of your teeth while you are using them. In fact, when I used them for the first time, I panicked a little when my 30 minutes were up. The strips become extremely sticky and slimy during usage, so it is almost impossible to peel them off of the front side of your teeth. I recommend pulling them off from the back of your teeth first, and though you might feel a slightly painful tug on the front of your teeth, it goes away quickly.\n\n4.) If you are going to apply these whitestrips, you MUST use a mirror to do so! It is important to place the strips RIGHT AT YOUR GUM LINE, or else you will get funky results. If you have any creases in the strip, that crease will show up on your teeth. When I used them for the first time, I did so without a mirror, and I had a thin horizontal white stripe in the center of all of my teeth. Though these lines disappear, it was very unsightly for awhile.\n\n5.) The immediate after math of using the whitestrips is not always pretty. First of all, the strips leave a thin gunky residue on your teeth, so it is important to brush afterwards. Also, the strips sometimes leave white spots or lines on the teeth. These spots are only temporary, but I do not recommmend using them right before you have to go somewhere important.\n\nOverall, I recommend this product. If you apply the Crest 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips according to the instructions on the included leaflet, you should see dramatically whiter teeth after you have used all of the packets in your box."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001OTE6NS", "title": "Men U Muscle Fibre Paste Hair Gel for Men 3.3oz", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91OS1heWgpL._SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "9 ratings", "description": "Men U Muscle Fibre Paste Hair Gel for Men 3.3oz", "reviews": ["I have thin and thinning hair that I keep about 1\" long (buzz cut it weekly with the no8 guide).

No it's not thin. It isn't supposed to be.\n\nThe pad is a GREAT 15\" LONG. Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market. I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection. Even light flow doesn't go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet. Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us. I don't know why the industry didn't realize a century ago that you shouldn't be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4'9\" to 6'7\". A 6-7\" long pad doesn't even protect the most direct fluid route if you're a larger lady.\n\nLying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\" inches long. We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry. These pads don't do that and I wish they did.\n\nI still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I'm afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum. If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I'm afraid even this pad will need frequent changing. Do Diapers work as an alternative? The answer is \"not so well\" as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid. Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes. If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on). Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.\n\nBack to these pads...\nFor comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS. They have made the best \"tops\", the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades. In other words they feel great and do stay dry. These don't have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE. Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad. That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT! Listen to MEEEE P&G.\n\nA word about those darned wings. All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe. They never stay in place. They don't spare your pretty panties anything. Take them away! I tuck them under [or scissor them off].\n\nThis pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that. When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall? You're handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person's hands and then putting all those bad particles there. That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that. I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.\n\nINCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose. Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners. They are as thin as a sheet of paper. And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to. Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.\n\nI'm switching back to Always from Natracare. Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare's SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you. I'm hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description. I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.\n\nI DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you'll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist. That's just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.\n\nFinally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.\n\nSOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.\n\nFor Natracare the best price I've found is at Lucky Vitamin The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10.", "WOULD LIKE KREFUND AND I CAN SEND THEM BACK", "I liked there\u2019s more then enough to have for a while.

Also, the trim was sometimes not sewn on well and some of the gold on the trim was peeled off.", "I was skeptical ordering these in ivory because the on line picture looked as though they were light beige. Well, it's hard to describe, but when they are turned one way, they appear very light Ivory and when they are turned another way they look darker and not what I would call Ivory. This is due to the weave and the shine that can appear. Aside from that the valances appear to be high quality. On the window they appear to be more beige and the pretty braided trim on the bottom is not even noticeable. They are not room darkening although the white backing may help. For the money, you can't go wrong. I think my color choice might be the root of my problem, but it is all I could use for my intended room.", "The color was definitely gold . But hung to long for my tests for a valance .", "Purchased the ivory valance to put on inside of my front door. I didn't want a curtain that drew attention to it since I have busy curtains around my large living room window close by, and I'm happy as this looks neutral and blends with the room. It does have a slight shimmer to it which to me makes it look more expensive than it is. I wanted the blackout function so weirdos can't peep into my house, and it works great! Per the instructions I threw in dryer with large wet towel for 20 minutes to get out wrinkles. It got most of them out and despite the instructions advising not to iron, I did anyway (carefully) on a medium setting and only on the cloth side (and not on the blackout side as the blackout material looks like it could melt if ironed). The pic shows the true ivory color. My last comment is the pic shows there is a small ruffle that flares out above the rod and my valance does have this ruffle.", "The color is darker than the photo but it is a nice deep wine color, the fabric is solid. It did however have very deep wrinkles where is was folded, they recommend cold ironing, I put it on med heat and still struggled for a long time without great results.

I am using this valance with a tension rod between my cabinets... Do I love the look of it? Not really... BUT this valance DOES have the thermal panel and IS blocking the sun.

So pleased that I ordered another set in dark grey for my daughter's room. I can't wait to hang those. I returned the microfiber valances that previously hung in her arch and opted for these instead since they're thicker and looks better with the white backing from the road. Both her window and mine face the same street and gives uniformity.", "These curtain valances are exactly what I needed to finish off my new bedroom set. They are a very good quality and are lined on the back with a rubber backing in white. I did not purchase the matching panel but I can see where they would be 100% light blocking if used over the entire window. They are true to what is advertised in size and fabric. I did not purchase these at a discount but they are really a great value for their price. To get the wrinkles out from being folded in shipping just put them in the dryer on a low setting with a damp wash cloth for about fifteen to twenty minutes. They are easy to care for which is great because dry cleaning is not in my budget. Overall I would highly recommend these curtain valances to my friends and purchase them again.", "We have full set on bedroom slider door and use the valances on the transom window above the bed. Definitely cuts down on the light coming in. The only negative is the white backing - I am sure it will come off over time. It already has some pin-size holes from washing. Have to be really careful when drying. Even without washing, I am sure the white backing will come off with long term exposure to Florida sun. Going forward, I will purchase the heavy duty blackout curtains without the thermaback.", "They are longer than expected, I should have measured better and the width was ok", "These definitely are black out valances, and are very thick. The quality is there, but to be honest...these look a little bit \"old lady\" to me. (Sorry old ladies...) It's the rope trim on the bottom. In the pictures it looks ok, but in person it looks kind of cheesy. I am giving these 4 stars because they are very well made, I just am not a huge fan of the look. Overall they are quality valances though and do the job.", "We bought this to cover an arched window above a big window in our home office. We have wooden blinds on the regular window but we were struggling to find a good way to cover the arched window. Our house faces East and in the morning the sun was just blinding. We put this up and we are so much happier. I can work in the office any time without having to squint and it is also much cooler in there. We have a couple more windows that could use some curtains, so we will probably be buying some more of this brand.", "Originall I purchased this thinking it would look great in the living room. After getting them I chose to put them over our sliding glass doors off our dining room. It was a great, inexpensive way to add some class to our dining room. I purchased one more (a total of 4) to put one over the door off the kitchen to bring both rooms together. They are GREAT quality for the price!!", "The quality of these valances were better than anticipated! After a quick iron with low heat, they were ready to hang. The valance at the width I ordered doesn\u2019t bunch, but it doesn\u2019t need to with the scalloped edge. The fabric\u2019s texture adds just enough visual interest to keep it from looking plain. Overall, I\u2019m very pleased with these and would order again!", "I bought this valance in burgundy for my mom to go with her new curtains. It looks pretty in the picture but even better in person. The material is nice and once ironed, looked lovely and it is not too heavy so a small rod works well. Great price too!", "Very good value. I purchased 2 for my window.

I have a very sensitive body and do not like those nasty artificial \"mint\" flavorings in conventional flosses. They make my gums burn. I used to use the \"unflavored High-Tech\" generic floss at CVS pharmacy but they stopped carrying it and only have the mint version - arrrhhhh- no mint! That's why I was so happy to discover Dr. Tung's natural floss with natural cardamom flavoring. It doesn't irritate my gums. The best part of this floss for me is that the fibers fan out really wide when between the teeth and I can visibly see much more \"junk and plaque\" on the string than with other brands.\n\nNOTE: Some people are complaining of shredding. Here's my tip: a couple of years ago when I used to buy this product, it used to shredded a lot because my teeth are spaced very close together. They must have improved their floss because it rarely shreds anymore. Just maybe 20% of the time I used it. I noticed that it usually shreds in my back molars where the space is tightest. One way I learned to minimize shredding is to floss straight up and down in those tight spaces - meaning, I don't floss at an angle. I have found that this almost always minimizes the shredding. Also, some of my molars have pointy ends, so I'm wondering if this is just tearing the floss when it comes into contact with the jagged ends? I am just more careful not to let it touch the pointy parts of my teeth and I think that prevents cutting of the floss. Now go enjoy this amazing cloth-like floss. It's such a great sensation and makes flossing, dare I say, actually fun?!", "I have long-standing issues with gum recession and pocketing, and I therefore brush and floss religiously and sleep with a night guard. It was a losing battle until I threw out my electric toothbrush and bought a Colgate 360 manual brush. (Highly recommend.) Then we had some notable improvement, but only to a point. I had also been looking for a woven floss for ages, but even the nasty mint-infused one I used to use seems to have disappeared. My dentist told me even he couldn't get it anymore, but still recommended I get some if I could. So I went searching online, and stumbled across this floss. I bought a 6-pack in desperation, based on the ridiculously positive reviews. I didn't understand how a dental floss could generate such enthusiasm. I mean, it's floss! But it's not like any other floss I've ever used. My teeth feel so clean after I use it. Also, I love the taste. I love mint, but not in my floss. This flavor is much more natural than most dental products. But the kicker was this: My dental hygienist was amazed at the improvement in the pocketing after I had been using this floss for only a month or two! I brought some in for my visit, and both she and the dentist approved of it, though neither had ever heard of it. After getting confirmation that I wasn't delusional about how great this floss is, I ordered another 12-pack. It arrived almost immediately.

It's thicker than other flosses but still slides well in my tight spaces. However, I've had more trouble with a few little spots of inflammation when using this, and my dentist could tell that I had been flossing daily but was puzzled about the inflammation and buildup. I ended up finding that this floss was not as effectively removing plaque from between my teeth, especially down near the roots, as other flosses I've used. I've been able to make it work better by \"scrubbing\" with it, but it just takes much longer to floss that way.\n\nI'll probably be switching back to Hayden expanding floss, which I had also used for a while and which gave better results for me at the dentist office.", "Short version - This floss is perfection. Okay, I know it is just floss, but I am a huge fan of this stuff. I like is that it isn't minty - it supposedly has some sort of flavor, but I really don't notice it. Who needs flavor in floss? Also, I like that it isn't waxed. Waxed floss always seems to leave residue behind and this doesn't do that. The floss is woven so it expands when it needs to, but can stretch to fit easily between tight teeth. And, it isn't skinny and sharp so it doesn't cut into my gums. So yeah, perfect - I will be distressed if this ever goes off the market.", "Thick enough to get stuff out, thin enough to get inbetween my (very) closely spaced teeth and my teeth definitely feel clean, clean, clean after I use it. It never misses a speck! Price is great, also. Whenever I offer my friends some after lunch I preface it with \"do you want to try the best floss ever?\"\n\nSide note: it does have a tiny amount of some \"natural plant and bees was coating\" which I think clumps up when I floss between particularly closely spaced teeth and it appears as if I have flossed out a tiny bit of white stuff. At first I thought it was stuff on my teeth, but after double checking with another floss I realized it's probably the wax. Now I just know what it looks like and ignore it. It is *very* subtle and doesn't leave residue in your mouth. (Definitely less coating than several of the other flosses I've tried)\n\nAnother note just in case you didn't know, if you floss something out from between teeth, make sure to keep flossing that space until nothing comes out. Just because you flossed there once, doesn't mean you got it all. I must say, however, this particular floss is pretty good and I rarely have to floss more than twice between teeth that had some food residue.", "Adjustable in teeth, so cleans better", "works well, quick delivery", "Product is just as described, and lasts a long time since there\u2019s so many in the package.

Take alone or mix with some juice and she sleeps so much better when she can\u2019t relax her brain.", "After years of trying to get my kids to bed at a decent hour I finally asked their pediatrician what to do. My daughter has an autism spectrum disorder and is on an anti-depressant for mood disorders. I used to give her Hylands Calm Forte for Kids but we were up to eight tablets and it still wasn't effective. Not to mention I had to force them in her mouth so they'd dissolve. She knows if there is something in her drink and she will not take any medications that she can taste. Her psychiatrist suggested giving her Benadryl at bedtime but I am not comfortable doing that. She would have lights out then lay in bed for up to an hour each night. After reading online reviews of this product I purchased it for both my children. My daughter gets one dropperful (1ml) in Sprite and she doesn't even notice it. What a blessing.\nI also bought it for our son who is five and hyperactive. He also has behavior disorders. He would toss and turn, talk, and fidget forever before he finally fell asleep. Even as a toddler at naptime in preschool he would not sleep and would keep the other kids awake with his restlessness. I started him on the 2 dropperfuls (2ml) which is the full dose. The first night he fell asleep after twenty minutes. I kept him on this dose until school let out. I now give him 1 dropperful each night and he falls asleep within thirty minutes usually. He takes it directly without mixing it into anything.\n\nI truly recommend this product to anyone with children who have sleep difficulty. I wish I had started using this product years ago with my kids. I've had many late nights with my kids because they just couldn't fall asleep.", "I've been using this for my 7 year old for a couple of years. Prior to this, bedtime was a real beast, no matter how tired he was, where he would spend an hour and more playing, jumping up and down on and off the bed, and be completely hyper until he would finally quit and fall asleep. There was no way he would fall asleep early enough on school nights on his own. Now, I give him half or a little less than half of the dropper - he weighs 60lbs - in his night time juice, and he calms down, and about 30 - 45 minutes later, he is ready to get into bed for story time. The taste is so faint that you can hide it in almost anything, which I have to do, but it's not at all unpleasant if you want to use it straight from the bottle. This has let my child get the sleep he needs and saved my sanity. It's also great for me since I am a light sleeper and can't get back to sleep if I'm woken up. Just take a dropper full and I won't be staring at the ceiling for hours waiting for morning.", "Our pediatrician suggested a melatonin supplement to help our 3-year-old have a better sleep schedule. My husband is a night owl and she had slowly joined his routine. My daughter throws a fit anytime I try to giver her anything like medication and can only find pills and chewable tabs locally. I was so glad to find these drops on Amazon.\n\nI add the drops to a small amount of sugar-free punch. She has no problems with it and will sometimes even ask for her \"night time\" drink. I have tried pills for myself in the past, but these drops work much faster.\n\nI would describe the taste as citrus and a tad odd. It bothered me at first, but now it is fine. The directions say to take 2 ml, which should be 2 dropper fulls. I could not get the dropper to fill to the 1 ml mark, so I usually just fill it to the 0.75 ml mark 3 times, close enough. There is a 0.25 ml mark but it's harder to get it to that amount.\n\nMy sister and I were discussing melatonin supplements for our kids and I told her I had found drops on Amazon and she said she did too. I described the bottle (the name had escaped me) and they are the same ones she ordered, she loves this product too.\n\nI just ordered my second time through Subscribe 'n Save and can't wait for it to arrive.", "Some will tell you melatonin supplements are \"snake oil\" and only trick you into thinking you'll fall asleep, so you do. I can say that Sleep Soundly does work, since my special needs daughter can't be given a placebo, since she is non-verbal and wouldn't understand the implication.\n\nMy daughter's sleep cycle is very easily interrupted by something as simple as an inactive day (uncommon, but occasionally we have a lazy weekend), and for years whenever this happened, we were having trouble getting her back on cycle. She would be up all night and then have trouble staying awake the next day... until we found this. Sleep Soundly warns it's not for children, so before giving it to her, we talked with our pediatrician and she said that it's safe enough that we could even give it to our toddler without ill effect; there's simply no way to overdose on melatonin (definitely talk to your pediatrician before giving this product to children, though. Never believe everything you read on the internet!).", "I normally don't write reviews but this stuff is awesome. My daughter has an extreme case of ADHD and even after waking up at 6:00 a.m. and having a day full of non stop playing, she fights her sleep everyday and will not actually fall asleep until midnight. After doing about 5 hours research and not finding any negative side effects I thought I'd try it. The best thing about it is that it taste like sugar so you can put it in milk or juice without them knowing. She can always tell if her apple juice or milk tastes different, but not with this. Some say it works within 5 minutes but my girl still takes around 30minutes to finally wind down then within the next 30 minutes, she passes out. Just ran out tonight and its going to be a long night I can tell. I don't understand how these kids can keep going all day non stop and still be wide awake at night. My daughter gets 10x better sleep with this and isnt cranky the next day from not getting enough deep sleep. If you are questioning whether it is healthy or not, I would say it's definitely healthier for your kids to get a full nights sleep and be well rested.", "I purchased this product for my son who is 11. I used to give my son a different type of drops when he was younger but it had a slight flavor to it which he didn't like. I then changed to the chewables since he was older. I couldn't figure out why they weren't working as well as the drops. It turns out he was hiding them in places around the house instead of taking them. I purchased these and they have been working like a charm. He can not taste any difference in his pediasure at night. He has been sleeping like he should be.", "This stuff really works! I take some about 20 minutes before I'm ready to go to sleep and it does the job in making me drowsy and getting me to sleep. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it doesn't help me stay asleep all night. I'll sometimes awaken a few hours later and am not able to get back to sleep. If it's at least 4 hours before I have to get up in the morning, though, I'll take a little more of this liquid to help me get back to sleep. I recently tried a \"timed release\" tablet version of Melatonin (also purchased on Amazon - see my other reviews) in hopes it would keep me asleep all night, but I ended up throwing the nearly full bottle of it in the trash because it did absolutely nothing -- it never even made me drowsy. I ended up buying this product again because I had such good luck with it helping me get to sleep.", "I was a little leery about using melatonin for my son but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. My son, who has special needs, was going through a rough patch and couldn't get to sleep at night. My doctor recommended melatonin. I chose this one based on others reviews myself. I give him two droppers an hour before bed and it immediately calms him and settles him for sleep. As others have mentioned, I give my son a \"break\" every month for about a week or so. I did notice that his night time sleep patterns would get disturbed, he'd be wide awake at 4:30. When that happened I would give him a break, he'd go down fine (because he was so tired from waking up early) and when I noticed him have trouble settling we would use it again. He has actually been off for a month now because he is going down fine without it. I think it's a great product: great value, non habit forming, and as no funky taste!", "With approval from the pediatrician we started this melatonin 2 weeks ago. I started off w/ one dropper full and now I give him one half of a dropper, with the same effect. My son, who has sensory, motor and speech disorders has never slept well. He is 31 months old. He slept about 9 hours a night, sometimes a lot less, no naps. Now he is at 11-12 hours a night. Asleep within 30 minutes, and can't keep his eyes open, he is that tired. Where we go from here, I don't know. Our therapists say he shouldn't need it for long, his natural melatonin should kick in, but from what I've read that isn't always the case. I think I'll try .33 of a ml next. All I know is we are getting decent sleep, and not having to soothe my son to sleep for an hour each night is a BLESSING.\n-by the way, I put the melatonin in with his Zyrtec dose and he drinks it down in a medicine cup.

We,(us and our son)hadn't had a full nights sleep in years. Our son's pediatric neurologist prescribed 3 mg of melatonin a night to help him sleep. The change was immediate! The dosing is easy, small, and the taste is easily masked in any drink. Our son has his in his hot cocoa 30 minutes before bedtime. The first night he was asleep within 45 minutes of drinking the product. He stayed asleep all night, and he was well rested and easily roused in the morning. This has been the case ever since then. The changes during the day are amazing as well. He is more focused, happy, has fewer meltdowns. His teachers at school all have marked his improvement. He looks healthier, well rested. This brand is excellent. The dosing per bottle adds up to an incredible value. The only downside has been that the included dropper is not able to draw the entire dose in one pull. I just draw smaller multiple doses to keep the amount accurate.", "So I use these for my very active (borderline hyperactive) child. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want to go to sleep. These things are NO JOKE. There is a trick to them. You can\u2019t give them to a child and let the child run free. These are best administered while reading a bedtime story or while giving an after bath lotion rub. Usually he\u2019s out within 20 minutes and sleeps soundly. My other older children also use them and have great experiences sleeping.", "I'm using the product to replace the prescription drugs I take for sleep. They are hardcore addictive drugs that I have been taking for years. I've been taking Sleep Soundly Melatonin for a few days as well as cutting my Rx dosage in half.

My initial desk came with pieces that were bent and warped beyond anything imaginable and the Walker Edison company was mostly unhelpful with fixing the issue. They essentially said to order a second one, swap out the parts I need, and ship the other one back. Now I have to figure out how to get this 60lb cumbersome box taped back up and delivered to my local UPS Store. Frustrating to say the least.\n\nNow I\u2019ll hope and pray the desk doesn\u2019t become a ticking time bomb and the glass doesn\u2019t randomly explode.\n\u2014\u2014\nSave your money and your sanity and find a better desk elsewhere. First of all, if you order the Alexa curved desk, the keyboard slides are welded on and can\u2019t be removed. Honestly, I could have tolerated that but the fact that I can\u2019t even assemble this huge pile of junk takes the cake! The curved center piece came with a really shoddy welding job that was bent and broken. Because of that, the bolt holes no longer align so no matter what I do, there\u2019s no assembling these two pieces. It can\u2019t be bent back into place either. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to the manufacturer but I\u2019m doubtful as to how fast they\u2019ll make this right. As of now, I\u2019m stuck working on the floor with a broken desk that\u2019s unreturnable. If they respond back or take measures to help, I\u2019ll update this review. As of now, though, two thumbs WAY down!", "I would buy it at the sale price again with it's issues... But only in the same circumstances of placement and that I don't need the keyboard tray. Most likely I got an one off from the factory and you might have better luck.\n\nI have three complaints that stem from one issue, measurements. One of the glass panels is slightly (nearly a centimeter) bigger front to back than the others making it not hold perfectly true in a corner. This could be fixed by adding a plastic edge to the back, but I don't think you can find one for the curve. The holes were slightly off center meaning I had to undo the rest in order to get everything to line up. Both of those issues were on the right side. The third is the keyboard tray on the left side won't fully close due to the back being slightly closer together than the front. I don't know if it's because the weld was done at a bit of an angle, an issue with placement of holes on the glass again or the length of the bars attaching the back legs. If not on sale Amazon has one without the keyboard tray for just slightly higher than the sale price of this one, and you can but a clamp on keyboard tray for about $25-$40.\n\nFor my purposes the desk doesn't need to be in a corner and the right side is the one on the wall, so you don't notice the first issue and I can use the keyboard on the top. Plus it was on sale, so it's cheaper than a similar model without the tray. It does look really nice and gives me much more space than my old setup, so I guess I can overlook the issues. And I'm not bothered enough to take it apart and send it in for a replacement.", "I love the look and simplicity of the desk. However the assembly was not the best. The measurements are slightly off so I struggled with making sure the glass didn\u2019t overlap (which could result in shattering). Although the instructions suggest doing the larger glass pieces first, I recommend starting with the smaller middle piece and working your way out. In addition to that, the table just didn\u2019t align correctly. I believe that\u2019s an issue with the legs and how you secure them together. My biggest issue is was the keyboard tray. Due to the legs lack of proper alignment I was unable to install my keyboard tray at all which is a pretty essential part of this desk. I didn\u2019t bother returning because I honestly think it\u2019s an overall manufacturing issue. For the price it wasn\u2019t a bad deal and it\u2019s really stylish so that helps.", "Components don\u2019t assemble or lineup very well, and the glass arrived chipped on one of the panels. I was able to file it down and smooth it out with a wet sanding cloth. The sliding keyboard tray is pretty much useless and the height is not adjustable.", "This desk is actually really nice looking, sleek, and modern. It has quite a bit of space for anything you need. The glass is tempered and is holding up well with some weight. The glass does not appear to scratch easily but it obviously needs to be cleaned often. The only issue I had was that one of the screw holes on the underside of the desk (attaching the left side of the frame to the center portion of the frame) was not drilled properly at all and became stripped. As long as you calibrate the position and torque of your screws after you've assembled the desk, the three separate glass tops will sit relatively flush with one another. Overall, especially for the price, this is an amazing desk.", "Assembly was straight forward and only needed an extra Phillips screwdriver. It fit together well. My only complaint is the glass panels didn't exactly match up on one \"corner\" where it the end piece met the corner triangle piece. It was small but noticeable. Figured for the price and the fact they are mass produced, it was reasonable. Assembled it is very sturdy and I already have it loaded up with a laptop and extra monitor and several notebooks. I did follow a previous reviewers suggestion and used the keyboard tray as a stand for the monitor. That required a trip to the hardware store for some legs and drilling thru the corners of the metal frame of the keyboard piece.", "This is a very sturdy table, and looks really nice now that it is set up.\n\nThe Cons: when you go to fit the glass on the table the holes do not align at all you will be forcing it to fit. This part was frustrating and almost sent it back. I am sure it was a defect in the manufacturing of the holes. But this does need work. So we dont plan on having to take it down anytime soon. Because it was such a pain to get the glass on top to align. Everything else was great. We just did a lot of walking away from it while putting the glass pieces on.lol It was for my son who is six foot he is not able to use the keyboard drawer, he is to tall so he took it out another down side. Howerever with that being said he just puts the keyboard on top no biggie and took the drawer out. At the price point once together it is a sturdy table. But if you are tall and having the keyboard drawer matters this table will be to short for the tall people. Hope this helps", "I need to mention that I got this for 50% off on sale. If I\u2019d paid the sticker price of over $200 I would absolutely not be okay with what I got.\n\nAssembly was a pain in contrast to what others have said. It\u2019s just screwing things together but I must have ended up with a part that is too small or otherwise ill fitting somewhere in here. I\u2019ve managed to get every screw into every hole but some of them required a monumental effort on my part and it was clear I was pushing the pieces to their limits to get it together. At the same time I can only really say every piece is screwed in, unfortunately I\u2019m left with one of the glass panes at a pretty noticeable slant. I wouldn\u2019t be able to fluidly slide something across the right angle of the desk for example.\n\nI\u2019d be cautious about the leg room if you need the keyboard tray. I\u2019m pretty thin and 5\u201911 so far from a giant and it\u2019s definitely pushing it. I don\u2019t really feel this is shown accurately in the images.\n\nThe glass is quite nice but the legs themselves definitely have a super cheap look to them, huge welding marks at the corners and all.\n\nOverall it\u2019s about the minimum of what I\u2019d have been okay with at the sales price. If you\u2019re seeing it for $200 I\u2019d look elsewhere.", "I needed a stylish desk bigger but not too big for home office. It was easy to assemble and it\u2019s very sturdy. It has an extra warp around for a laptop or other items. I love it!", "Buyer Beware! After setting this up a few months later the glass has popped out of place with the silver brackets that was attached to it. The corner piece is now just resting on the metal and so is the right side. I haven't had this this for not even a year yet and it's broke. Now I can probably super blu the brackets back on to the glass but I would have to disassemble the entire desk to do so which is a pain in the butt and I'm afraid the desk might actually shatter.

I went to go pick it up from my apartment office and I could not lift it, no one in the office could lift it, and one my husband got there he had a lot of difficulty trying to lift it.\nAlso, in the picture it shows a stand for the tower. This is basically just a rectangular piece of metal that sits on the floor, not connected to anything and to me, doesn't really serve much of a purpose.\n\nOverall, the desk is great and I would definitely recommend it - I would just suggest you have someone there with you to help you carry the box."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002ZCXZJ4", "title": "Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Waist Tab Jean", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91nOf1rVoOL._AC_UY500_.jpg", "ratings": "13 ratings", "description": "Levi's Men's 514 Slim Straight Waist Tab Jean", "reviews": ["It's tough to find jeans that fit and look flattering on a tall skinny guy like me, but these do the trick.

Yes, they are sturdy, and not so loosely wound that they fly off when you want to grab some. For those that struggle with having to use them one-handed, I would suggest pre-loosening one in anticipation before an \"emergency\", so it is easy to grab when your hand(s) is(are) mucky; not so difficult. Some would think this too \"unsightly\", to have a sheet or two hanging loosely, but their lives will be made difficult in all matters with that mindset. Also, using a firmly mounted towel holder, like an under-the-cabinet towel holder, rather than a countertop stand, will hold it firmly enough to pull off a sheet. I actually quite happy that they don't unroll too easily and flop about. I don't want the entire roll coming off in one tug. They hold still, so they can be torn off without too much coming unrolled, and with one can tear it off with just one hand, rather than having to steady the roll so it won't all come undone. When I know I'm going to need to use some, whether for cooking, in the art studio, or whatever and wherever, I take off what I know I'll need and I have it ready to go. It's kind of a no-brainer.

Viva has a loyal following for those who want a thick, useful paper towel, one that isn't loosely wound, like the other brands that give a false appearance of having more of their filmsy junk than is actually there. The \"Choose-A-Sheet\" is just right, as often what is needed is either the smallest option, a single sheet (equal to a regular \"half sheet\"), or three sheets (equal to a regular sheet-and-a-half).", "The most soft paper towel I\u2019ve ever used. I love them", "I just have to say that I love these paper towels. They are soft, absorbent, and can substitute as a napkin at the table, even for a more formal meal, in a pinch.\n\nYet, there are downsides. I'll address them:\n\n1) These paper towels are expensive. As a stay-at-home mom, I feel as if these paper towels are a splurge. And yet, they are so useful. When using a paper towel to swipe at a yucky mess on the kitchen counter (like raw chicken juices), I only need one small piece of paper towel (the choose-a-sheet option is so handy). When cleaning bathroom mirrors, a full sheet takes care of an entire mirror. When we grab a roll to keep in the car, a child can use a sheet as a \"plate\" for small bites of cheese and salami and then wipe his or her hands on it afterwards.\n\n2) Store brands work just as well. Sorry; I beg to differ. These paper towels are so soft that I can wipe my two-year-old's face with them and she doesn't complain. The paper towels are so absorbent that just one usually does the trick. Furthermore, it is even fun to use them because they do feel like a splurge!\n\n3) The natural-minded family should be using cloth paper towels and napkins. Yeah, I agree with that one. You should check out Moo Cow Mama's Etsy listings for bright, adorable cloth napkins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/123470498/beach-cloth-napkins-summer-decor-beach?ref=shop_home_feat_3\nLet's just say that my family is getting there. I picked up some cheap cloth napkins at Wal-Mart and they work just fine. They're a good option. There are just seasons when it is nice to have a disposable option.\n\nOkay, so if you do have a baby, like me, you need to use these paper towels to make your own baby wipes. Recipe + instructions here: http://hip2save.com/2014/01/06/video-how-to-make-homemade-baby-wipes/", "While the price point for the Viva line may be a bit higher as compared to other leading brands, the extra few cents per roll is well worth it. These towels are sturdy and absorbent for cleaning up any mess, but work well for a wide variety of tasks. The select-a-size is an added bonus since you do not have to waste an entire sheet for something less daunting. I keep a few rolls out in the garage for general use (paint, grease, oil cleanup) as well as one in each of my vehicles. They have the durability to be squeezed out and reused for applications like water cleanup. The only drawback is a relatively minor one - when cleaning glass or similar objects such as a car, there are a few tiny fibers which are left behind. This makes it a bit more challenging to use them for Windex, and probably shouldn't be used on a car if you care about tiny scratches. You should stick to a lint-free cloth for electronic screen and car finishes as you might expect. This particular deal on Amazon (4 packages with 6 rolls each) is priced just a little bit better than local retail. When you consider prime shipping and not having to pick these up at the store, the value goes up a bit (normally you pay a price for convenience). I have re-ordered these on Amazon for the past 3 years, probably every 2 months. Great buy.", "OK, this is going to sound like the rave of a crazy person\u2014or worse, someone who works for Viva\u2014but I swear it's all true.\n\nI'm not big on brands names. I'm usually willing to give a generic brand a try to see if it's any good. I couldn't tell you what brand of toilet paper I last bought or which orange juice is in my fridge right now. I have a number of brands I like, often a few I absolutely hate, but I just buy the one that's the least expensive at the time I'm buying it.\n\nThere are a few exceptions, and Viva is on that very short list. A friend had raved about Viva and I gave her my speech about how I really don't have favorites of most things, that I try to shop frugally without giving up quality. But the more I used them, the more I liked them. To me, Viva feels more like a very lightweight cloth than paper. They last a good long time when I'm working in the kitchen and I like that they offer the Choose-a-Sheet rolls (what the bigger brand calls Select-A-Size, which is admittedly a much better name). I find I almost never use more than the half-size sheets now.\n\nJust as my friend showed me why she likes Viva, I've done the same with my mother. In fact, mostly as a joke I gave her a three-pack of rolls for Christmas (among other things; don't start telling me I'm a terrible son), but mostly to keep her from stealing them from my pantry when she visits.", "When Amazon dropped Viva giant from the sub & save program a month ago I turned to these. I figured they might make a reasonable substitute for roughly $23 per month. What could it hurt, after all these are the same towels just with big instead of giant and with a handy choose-a-size option right?\n\nWrong.\n\n1. They are thinner\n2. They don't hold up as well and tear (compared to Viva original--they will likely hold up better against other brands)\n3. They are rougher slightly abrasive than Viva Giant.\n\nand this was the worst imo:\n\n4. They leave lint--lots of it, EVERYWHERE. On your table, wood surfaces, counters, mirrors, skin -- it's really ridiculous. When you need to re-rinse or look for a no lint towel to wipe up the dusty lint left by the paper towel you just used, then there's definitely a problem. This was very visible especially on my glass table top and mirrors.\n\nWith Viva giant if I needed to do a quick cleanup for say a food drip on a jacket or the kids needed to wipe their hands or face before dodging out, all I had to do was a damp touch up. Big mistake with these towels. What ever you wipe would need to be rinsed off. Lint gets on eyelashes & face and heaven help you if you wiped clothes. Dark or light the lint would then need to be washed or rinsed out.\n\nSilly me I thought choose-a-size meant same towel w/a neat tear line for you to choose a smaller size if you wished. I had no idea it meant choose a cheaper skim-version of Viva.\n\nIf it weren't for that I might say these were a fair substitute but no, the lint was too much.\n\nAs I was coming on to cancel my sub and save of this item I unbelievably found out that after only one shipment Amazon raised the price from the $23 +change that I subscribed to $37 + (with Amazon Mom). Are you kidding me? You introduce the subscribe and save for this last month and change it the next?\n\nIt's bad enough that you took away the best towels and offered this low quality replacement but really...prime is losing its value. Amazon your loyal shoppers deserve better.", "These are absolutely horrible paper towels. I do not understand the rave reviews. Perhaps I got a bad batch. I bought a big pack (24 rolls). I wish I could return them. I do not often give one star reviews but here is why this product absolutely deserves my one star:\n\nLet's get the pros out of the way first: Pros:\n* The paper towel adheres to the roll. This makes it easy to grip and pull only as much as you need. (It also tends to 'stick' to other surfaces, see \"cons\")\n* The paper towels are very soft. I guess this is a Pro for some people but not for me. I don't understand why a paper towel needs to be soft since you aren't generally using a paper towel on sensitive areas on your skin. Bath/Facial tissue is understandable, towels not so much. This is a good quality for hand drying towels but that's about it.\n\nCONS:\n* SOFT: Yeah it's soft. I don't get why this is important. The paper towels are soft to the touch like thick toilet tissue and they perform as you would expect thick toilet paper to perform. Notably two problems with the softness:\n\n* They disintegrate and fall apart immediately when wet. This is compounded if you use any cleaning solution. In my household we rarely use anything stronger than a mild water/vinegar dilution and even that causes these paper towels to shred. As you can see from these pictures, these towels were used to clean a microwave and mirror and you can see the horrible lint situation that is left behind.\n\n* Even when dry, they lint badly. Rubbing them against your fingers causes a cascade of dust.\n\n* Clingyness. This was a pro because it adhered to the roll but it's a problem when you are trying to clean something like glass. Regardless if you spray the cloth or the glass first, the paper towel doesn't want to glide across the surface and you generally end up bunching the paper towel up into a ball, causing it to fall apart because of it's \"softness\".\n\n-------\n\nAgain I don't give 1 star reviews often. But these paper towels are not suitable (in my opinion) to use on glass, mirrors, electronics, or anything that you don't want lint all over. Thrift store towels are better. These are marginally better than toilet tissue for cleaning. I have to go behind myself with a feather duster to clean up after these towels. If I could give negative stars for making cleaning duties even worse, I would.", "Paper towels, the most used towels in my household throughout the day. We go through at least a roll per day so its important to select a brand that provides the most bang for the buck. In our quest for the ideal paper towel, we've encountered cheap, melt in our hands type and durable, strong as real cloth type. Viva paper towels fall towards the latter type. They are high quality, soft, absorbent and feel like real cloth. They don't melt when they get in contact with water. They are durable and can actually be re-used if needed. For example, after using a towel to dry our hands, we sometimes wipe the sink and/or kitchen counter top with the same towel before throwing a piece into the trash. This allows us to make the most use of a paper towel before discarding it. The ability to \"choose-a-sheet\" also adds to the savings. For maximum savings, we rotate between different brands of quality paper towels and Viva is in the rotation.\n\nIf you haven't used Viva, give it a try. It may just become your favorite paper towel.", "I was skeptical because I've always been a Bounty guy and EVERY other non Bounty paper towel I've tried has been a massive fail (Sparkle most recently). So like with Q-Tips (always use the proper Q-tips because the knock offs are terrible always), I have remained loyal to my select a size. But I read good reviews and took a flier trying these out. Glad I did. It literally took me 6 rolls to decide how I felt about them relative to Bounty. I finally think I've decided I like them better. Both are 5 star products. The difference is that Viva is a decidedly cloth like feel vs. an absorbent paper like feel. The Viva are super absorbent and you can wring them out and reuse them (great for a counter spill). The texture is good for a nice napkin, which I need because I don't use napkins. Totally worth a try. You may wind up loving the cloth feel of these and switch. If you don't love it, at least you aren't suffering through terrible quality paper towels you just wish would go away. You'd be using these and still impressed with how well they work.", "OMG! We'll Never Buy Paper Rolls Again! At first glance these roles of soft cloth-like sheets appear to be smaller than rolls that boast more sheets and are marketed as jumbo, Giant, etc... When actually while these single ply roles are actually tighter rolled sheets yielding a more capable, more cost-effective product per sq ft. Than Brawny, Bounty, Scott, Great Value, or any other sheet paper product we tried. SUPERIOR for house cleaning! FANTASTIC on the new Glass Top Stoves! SUPERIOR for spill pickups! SUPERIOR ABSORBENCY! SUPERIOR for cleaning car interiors, dashboards ...even armor all application too! Soft enough to clean jewelry with and even apply makeup with! A SIMPLY AMAZING product with ENDLESS USES! In fact, We haven't found a project yet where it didn't come out on top! And no, we do not have any affiliation with the manufacturer other than making a verified purchase here on Amazon! Try it ...It'll replace all those specialty wipes and you'll never buy traditional paper rolls again!\n\nPRODUCT UPDATE: THRILLED with these! Constantly finding new uses! Moisten lightly for GREAT RESULTS on Laptop screens, Computers and Monitors!!! its uses are endless!!! :-)\n\n3 MONTH USAGE UPDATE... We've had to change our 5 STARS rating to 1 STAR due to continued manufacturing defects! We had to send our last case order back and CANCEL our subscribe and save orders on these! Firstly, the manufacturer is aware of a problem with the sheets being so tightly wound on the cardboard core that they have a tendency to crush or deform the core which prevents these sheets from dispensing properly on ANY HOUSEHOLD DISPENSER! Additionally, the third case shipment we received had defective sheet perforations which did not allow for the sheets to tear individually causing a real mess as each sheet would shred in pieces trying to come off the roll! :-(\nWhile we were extremely enthused with the product and its extended uses far beyond that of ordinary paper towels when we received our first case, its just NOT WORTH THE CONTINUED STRUGGLE to attempt to use this product as received defective multiple times! While the cloth like material is a great idea, the manufacturers quality control is terrible resulting in continually defective product being shipped.", "These are the only paper-towels I buy anymore! They are extremely durable yet soft enough to clean off an infant's messy face! I subscribe to these every 6 months and I think I end up buying maybe one or two additional single rolls at the grocery store until my next order, but we use paper-towels almost daily. The nice thing about them is that, say I use them to dry my hands, I can use the same paper towel multiple times before I need to throw it away; it is virtually a hand towel. I have used it to clean/scrub table tops/counter tops... and I can use one paper towel to finish an entire table or counter (unless of course it is extremely caked on with food, etc. then may need or just want to grab another one). Overall I think these are the best paper towel available for your money out there. I won't personally buy anything else (and when I use other people paper towels in their homes, I often recommend that that buy these if they don't already, I'm serious, they are that good!)", "I slice these rolls in half and use them to make wipes for diaper changes. They are the only paper towel I've ever tried that I would do that with. With the choose-a-size rolls, the wipes rip off in neat little squares--just like store-bought wipes, but without any weird chemicals or alcohol. These wipes are lovely.\nWipes recipe for any moms or dads who found the store-bought wipes were giving their baby diaper rash: 2 tbsp pure aloe vera gel, 1 tbsp Dr. Bronner's castille soap, 1 tbsp witch hazel extract (should be no more than 15% alcohol). Combine with 2 cps freshly boiled water, pour over half a roll of Viva paper towels (cut side down), big rolls, in a sealable container. Let thoroughly absorb, pull out the cardboard roll, and start pulling out your wipes from the center. Happy wiping! (Pro-tip: cut the paper towel rolls in half with a very sharp straight blade knife, sharpening the knife again between rolls. I somehow thought a serrated blade would work better and used that for a while, but that just makes a mess.)", "I ordered 6=15 rolls. I received 6=12 rolls. I'm not happy with this substitution!!", "I'm a big fan of Viva paper towels. I've been using them for many years. I've tried other paper towels, but Viva's softness and absorption are the best. Other paper towels tend to sop up a spill, these actually absorb a spill. I'm not one to waste paper, so the ability to use a single towel to clean a mess is a huge bonus. I like to use the half sheet towels. If it's a toddler-sized spill, I may have to use 2 half sheets, but rarely more than that. Viva paper towels do leave fibers behind if washing windows, so I do also use super-cheap, thin paper towels (usually store brand recycled paper) for dusting, windows and mirrors.\nI buy these through subscribe & save. The price is always the same or better than at the store and I no longer worry about running out of paper towels.", "We've bought Viva paper towels for years now. They're better, in our opinion, than any other paper towel on the market. It took a little while to get used to the choose a size function but it's actually nice to be able to pull off a short piece to clean up small messes. Less waste, towels last longer. Amazon's been a great source and so far has been between a bit and a lot cheaper than buying them at the grocery store plus they come right to the front door.", "When I found the Viva towels, choose a size, I was overwhelmed with joy. I have always thought there was such a waste with the other brands and their full size.\n\nMy husband was the first to start to use them instead of regular Kleenex tissues. Then I started. These towels have really saved us money. We have just started on Social Security and a very fixed income, so the additional use saves us much needed money. They also do a great job cleaning both in the kitchen as well as in the bathroom. I am glad Amazon has reduced the price again. When Amazon raises the price to $45 or $55 a carton I can find them at Walmart for the same $33 a case... and both have shipping for free...(I am a Prime Amazon shipper and Walmart has free shipping with a certain amount of purchases).\n\nI cannot say enough about how great Viva is as well as such a money saver!", "Just the Best! Got these on sale one time a few yrs. ago at a local store. After I tried them I went back for more, but they were cleared out! From then on out I find deals online and buy in bulk. These will last you a long time! For two people 2pks lasted more then 6 months. Love the pick a size the best. Yes they might leave a little lint but these feel and work like a wash cloth you toss away. I used them to scrub everything, glass stove top with the cleaner using very little 1-2 (2 makes one reg size of others that would tear up before I finished) Spills or in the garage to wipe off the oil on your hands you name it.", "I love these paper towels. They are the only ones that I will buy from now on. They are very soft, kind of like a cloth, but thick. I do not need to buy dishcloths or sponges anymore, I have scrubbed with this paper towel. At first I did not because I was afraid it would fall apart, but alas, it did not fall apart even while scrubbing the stove top. You could even use these to blow your nose on, it's softer than some tissues and great to use as a napkin.. I also like the Choose-a- Size feature also. They are expensive, but it is nice to feel a soft, strong paper towel that can take a scrubbing. My husband even likes them and told me to not buy any other paper towels. My mother even liked them. Viva is the superior paper towel by far than any other brand.", "Believe it or not, I have had every contractor and customer in my building ask were I got these from as they feel like shop towels and work great. I tell them and they can't believe its from Amazon and the price. These are high quality, better quality than even I expected when I ordered them for the company. Now I order them for my home as well. Absorbency is really good, might be beat by a bigger brand, but still better than cheap ones. Where the difference is, is the strength. it beats all other bigger brand ones by far, it compares to a blue shop towel. May it be food spill, cleaning, killing a spider these are the paper towels to get it done."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0037UT2CC", "title": "Melissa & Doug Annie - 12' Drink & Wet Doll", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71nR9nE5CYL._AC_SX569_.jpg", "ratings": "1,909 ratings", "description": "Little ones will love cuddling and caring for this poseable baby doll with a wipe-clean body!

The doll doesn't sit well on the potty which is why we bought it but my daughter was so cute feeding the doll her bottle. She was obsessed with giving this doll her bottle!", "I bought this for my daughter to help get her interested in potty training. It honestly just annoys me because it\u2019s messy and she needs a lot of help to play with it. The bottle holds more water than the toilet so it overflows. The doll is hard to position on the toilet and doesn\u2019t stay. And it\u2019s hard to feed her the bottle while she\u2019s upright on the toilet. But the water goes right through the doll, so she has to be on the toilet. It is cute watching her try to put the diaper on her (it\u2019s not waterproof, FYI), but she needs help with that, too. She also needs help putting the clothes/hat on. As far as baby dolls go, it\u2019s fine. The pacifier actually stays in the doll\u2019s mouth. Just plan on being involved while playing with this doll and cleaning up after!", "I really like this doll. She\u2019s perfect!", "I purchased this doll to use with the book \"Toilet Training in Less Than a Day\". This doll does not function exactly as needed for that method but it was the closest I could find and we made it work.\n\nIn that method, the idea is to give the doll a drink, take her to the potty, pull down her underwear and then have her go potty. This is important so you can train the child using the doll on the proper way to go potty and then what to do if you have an accident. The problem is, as soon as you start giving this doll a drink, she starts to wet.\n\nTo make do, we held her on her back directly over the potty chair while we gave her a drink and then tipped her up into the sitting position over the potty chair. It worked okay but isn't as effective as it could be for the lesson being taught.\n\nPotty training aside, she is a pretty doll with eyes that open and close. She is well made with nice coloring. Her clothing, bottle, and potty chair are all well constructed.", "I ordered this for a great-granddaughter's third birthday. She was totally enthralled with it. I can't take a photo because she took it home to Florida with her but I can say she strapped the doll in on the airplane and took her out to hold up to the window so the doll could see they were on an airplane. Pretty cute, huh? Will add the caution that the doll DOES WET so before feeding be sure you are prepared for the water to come out quite quickly. A fun experience.", "I bought this to encourage my daughter to potty train. I suppose it might have helped her get the idea a little, but really it has just been a fun doll for her to play with, particularly the fact that it can go in the bath and it can go potty. If you are using it for potty training, be aware that the water goes immediately through the doll, so you must have it positioned on the potty to catch the water or the doll will have an \"accident\". I found it difficult to hold the baby, the potty and the dolly, particularly if I attempted to put my daughter on the big potty too. The doll does not sit well on the potty by herself. I actually found it easier to have my daughter give the doll the bottle while I held the doll over the real toilet than to try to mess with the little potty that comes with the doll. However, she has had lots of fun with it and it comes with fun accessories - like the undies, diaper, binky, etc.", "My daughter is 2.5 and loves this doll! She is doing some awesome pretend play with her; it\u2019s fun to watch! She sits well, her eyes close when she\u2019s laying down, the pacifier stays in her mouth when you put it in all the way. We have not tested out the drink water and wet feature yet, so I can\u2019t comment on that yet. I gave this a lower score primarily because this baby doll, who you feed with a bottle and who wears diapers, has noticeable breasts! Lumps that actually stick up. I\u2019m disappointed, especially because I trust Melissa and Doug products. I mean, why are boobs necessary on a baby? But other than that, we love Annie.", "My daughter loves this doll. I saw a video on it with helping with potty training. If you give this baby water, make sure it's already wearing the diaper or is sitting on the potty that comes with it (as the water just goes straight down). It does not easily sit on the potty by itself, you may have to hold it on there. The bottle is very specific to this baby. If you lose it, no other bottle that I've found will work with it. However, for the price, it's a great doll and my daughter loves taking on and off the diaper. She also loves that it came with big girl panties and a hat (which doesn't stay on the head that good). It's well made, arms and legs move freely. Again, she loves this doll and they go potty together a lot.", "Absolutely love Melissa and doug but I should have looked at the description before I ordered it. Overall quality is very good.", "This is a sweet, small doll that\u2019s solid but plastic. My daughter asked for a doll that can go in the tub and wet a diaper. This did both for a great price. I did return it for a doll that does #2 as well. But, overall great doll!", "Purchased this doll for my 18 month old granddaughter for Christmas as requested by her mom. Didn't pay much attention to what I was actually ordering until it arrived and then I was tickled by how absolutely perfect it is for a toddler. She was delighted with her \"baby\" and was easily able to carry it around and to give it the bottle and pacifier that came with it, and to sit it in the chair-- in and out, over and over, that's what 18 month old's do and she couldn't have been happier. I found a little bag to hold the accessories so they didn't get swept up with the Christmas wrappings, and it was all intact when she left here 4 days later. Whether she will be able to keep the pieces together or not we'll have to see but I'm betting she will have this baby for a very long time. Highly recommend!", "I bought a different one for potty training my first child and that one broke quickly. This one seems sturdier. I like that the water doesn't go into the doll unless you squeeze the bottle. That made it easier to not make a mess.", "My 2-year old granddaughter is just learning to go potty and really likes her doll mimicking potty-training & diaper change along with eyes that wake & sleep. The water bottle is great except you have to feed her sitting slightly reclined on the potty as the water does go right through her or the cloth diaper if she's wearing it-which they warn does this. The bottle is a little bit big for my little one to squeeze on her own in order to get the water into the dolly. But that's okay. We play with it together if she's using a filled water bottle. When I'm not around she can play with it all as long as the water bottle is empty and still has fun with the non-water play as well.", "My pre-schooler loves this baby doll. I wanted an all plastic doll (versus one with a soft cloth midsection) that was more realistic with closing eyes. (I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to one eye doesn't completely close.) But still a great doll. She is the perfect size for my 4 yr old. With movable arms/legs, dressing her is a breeze. I didn't inform my daughter that the doll actually 'drinks and wets', so we don't use that function and she is still perfectly happy with it. To compliment this purchase, I also bought the Melissa & Doug Doll Accessories Bundle. My daughter was thrilled with both the baby and all of her great accessories! Would recommend!!", "My 4 and a half year old daughter wanted a baby doll that she could feed and would go potty, so this looked like a great option and we were happy with the quality of the items. It is a little bit of a juggling act to get Annie to sit on the potty and drink at the same time without falling or squirting, but my daughter enjoyed it. She was heartbroken when we left the bottle on an airplane after vacation because that takes most of the fun out of the set. We have called the airlines, called Melissa and Doug (who do not have that particular bottle available to send as a separate item) and are now experimenting with making our own bottle. My suggestion would be to have an extra bottle in the kit - always good to have a backup with these small toys for small kids. Suggestions from anyone else who has dealt with this issue welcome!", "Bought this for my daughter for her second birthday. She enjoys playing with it and it is a great size for her. The main struggle we have is getting the doll to balance on the potty; she has to have my help most every time and now has struggled enough that she brings it to me instantly to get it set-up for her. The doll pacifier is also a little bit difficult for a child to put in the doll's mouth on her own. This is not a problem when we are playing together, but if she is playing on her own, this is a difficult toy to play with 100% at this age. Otherwise, great choice and so glad we chose this doll for her help in potty training!", "This is a really, really cute doll - far cuter than anything else I have seen for the money. Her rosebud outfit is adorable. Both my daughters have spent hours bathing her, dressing her, and diapering her. Her dress, velcro-ed up the back, is easy even for a young toddler (18 months or so) to put on. Her hat comes off easily, but goes on reasonably easily, too. The pacifier and bottle are fun accessories. And the little potty is fun, too - but as other reviewers have noted, the \"drink and wet\" aspect of the doll is a little weird. Water goes right through her. But that weirdness as a drink-and-wet makes her absolutely perfect for giving a doll-bath. Water doesn't get stuck inside her. And our little Annie has survived hundreds of baths with no noticeable impact on her face.", "It's a cute doll with a sweet face. We love that the eyes close. My 5 year old daughter wanted a baby that had a potty and would go pee. (I didn't want to get anywhere near those Baby Alive dolls since they're so expensive and I can't handle their huge heads and molded plastic hair, no matter how fun they could be!) She's old enough to play with the doll without making a huge water mess, although I've encouraged her to play with it in the bathtub so we don't have to worry about keeping the water in one place! The accessories are nice and the outfit is cute and soft. Pay attention to the size of this doll... 12\". It's really quite small! Despite that, my daughter has had and is having a lot of fun with it.", "My 16 month old loves her new baby doll! This Melissa & Doug doll is a great first doll for baby and comes with every accessory you will need. The outfit is high quality and adorable (almost something you'd put on your own child in their size!). My only cons with this doll--the bonnet doesn't stay on too well and the pacifier is hard to keep in the doll's mouth. Other than that, it's wonderful! My toddler quickly figured out how to put the bottle in the doll's mouth and put her on the toilet. We aren't using it for the drink & wet feature yet but we tried it out and it works as expected!"]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0038PDVNC", "title": "Smith Teamaker EcoSmart Cup, White, Green", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cxlGhjr5L._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "1 rating", "description": "EcoSmart Viridian Paper Hot Cups provide an upscale image for specialty hot beverages.

You see I have a very very coarse beard and moustache. When I shave it doesn't even seem like I shaved. Sometimes I kid myself by saying that my facial hair is like barb wire. Haha. I'm trying to play it off a little bit but it can be seriously detrimental to your self image if you don't learn to have a thick skin or take things too personally. Anyway back to the review. Of course they (the Mach 3s) don't shave as close or as smooth as the Fusion blades but they're the next best thing. And they don't cost nearly as much. They're still sorta pricey as you guys who have a budget can probably attest to. But what makes 'em a bit costly for me is that the blades only last me for like two or three good close shaves. After that they start cutting wimpy again. It's a little more cost effective if I buy them in bulk. That's why I buy the 15 packs. Matter of fact that's what got me sucked in to writing this review for you guys. I need to get some more. And it doesn't help that my skin is not only producing coarse hair it's also a little more sensitive than most men's skin. So I feel razor burn a little more than most men too. And although it's not seriously bad I do feel a little twinge of it every day under my chin.\n\nMY SHAVING TECHNIQUE\nWhen I shave I have to really prepare my beard and face 1st by washing my face and taking a very warm 8-10 minute shower (exclusively on my beard). I know this isn't for everybody but it's better for my really coarse hair. Anyway I wash it of course in order to remove any oils and debris that has built up throughout the previous day so that nothing will impede the cutting of the hairs. The very warm water (not real hot mind you. Just hot enough before it starts getting a little too uncomfortable. That's all.) to soften the beard where the beard can come off rather easily. It may not come off like a hot knife thru butter but it makes the hairs under my sideburns just fall off. And bc my hairs tend to lay flat when I shave I apply a little Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave solution on my dry face after I dry off to supposedly make the hair stand erect. It seems to work a little but I still get a little uncut hairs left. Then after I wet my face I put a few drops of shave oil on my face to help the blade glide more across my face to help prevent cuts. Then I put the shave gel or cream on. Now for me bc I have very coarse hair, especially around my mouth, I have to make two passes. You may only have to do just one and get away with it. I can't. Haha. On the 1st pass I shave with the grain (or in the direction my hair grows) downward for the most part. Upward under my Adam's apple. And then after I shave my whole face I apply a 2nd coat of shave gel or cream and I do a 2nd pass shaving against the grain. I do the sideburns 1st bc their already soft and work my way inward to about 1/2 inch to the mouth. I don't shave my mouth area just yet in order to leave the shave gel or cream on it to continue letting the water absorb softening it more bc it's the coarsest hair on your face. Then I jump to the other sideburn and start shaving inwardly towards my mouth. When I get 1/2 an inch to my mouth I move to under my chin. After I go across under my chin. I move to my neck. But here's where it gets sorta tricky. The hairs under your Adam's apple grow in the opposite direction of the rest of your face so I switch directions there to shave in the opposite direction. (i.e. if you were shaving downward now you go upward. If you were shaving upward on your 2nd pass you shave downward). Now you're almost finished. Double check to see if there are some hairs still uncut. You may have to twirl cut them (bc a one directional cut may not cut the hair) with your blade that is if they're stubborn hairs that don't want to be cut. Now don't be lolly gagging too much here doing that bc your face has just been traumatized with all that cutting and is probably getting inflamed. So you want to turn the faucet on the coldest water settings as soon as you can. And apply it to your face. This is not going to be pleasant. But man up bc if you don't you'll wish you had. Bc this can help your face avoid swelling and bumping up. And nobody wants to see their face all red and swollen and bumpy. Anyway when you're finished you can admire that work of art you just created. If you want to you can even enhance your face with an after shave or some cologne or whatever turns you on. It's your world man. Face it with a smile knowing that you got this.", "I have been using Mach3 razors for over 22 years. I recently tried using a no-name refil but the quality was not the same.

You won't be disappointed!", "does the job", "great product", "The value was good.", "I experienced difficulty in finding this item in the usual retailer. Fortunately, I found it to be available on Amazon.com. Exactly the product that I wanted and delivered promptly.", "The razors came on time, and the package and the razors were in good condition.", "Great blades, i keep reordering. Nothing wrong with this.", "I have heavy growth. Have tried many, these work best for me.", "Very close shave with no razor burn", "Ok product, only good for one shave per blade comfortably and very expensive.", "Gillette really screwed the pooch when they came out with the Mach 3. I remember it clearly I was a young lad in my early 20's when I first discovered the magic and sheer awe of the Gillette Mach 3 blade. I had tried many other shaving devices, disposable, one blade, two blades, 4 blades, 5... 6? Blades? all inferior...\n\nI think it may have been because I was homeless and living in my van but I soon discovered that a simple Gillette Mach 3 blade was in fact so good that one blade could in theory last a lifetime if properly cared for. Gillette must have also had this realization because they quickly moved to stifle the interest in the Mach 3 by coming out with an endless series of supposedly better options. They even tried to make it seem like the Mach 3 was not as good as it really was by adding that stupid moisturizing strip which wears off in about a week or two.\n\nHere is the thing with the Mach 3. Yes, there is a moisturizing strip and yes it will go away after a few weeks of daily use... YOU DON'T NEED IT!. The only reason that strip exists is to inform the user that it's time to change blades but in actuality your blade is perfectly fine. Another thing. you might notice that the sharpness of the blade also diminishes in the first week or two. This is another attempt to get you to purchase more blades. In reality the first two weeks of using a Mach 3 is what I call the break-in period. This is the period where the blade is actually too d@mn sharp! and you cut yourself a lot. After this break in period the blade is perfectly sharp and will continue to be so (as long as you wash it well and clear out the hairs from between the blades) for an indefinite time.\n\nNotice also, how you can never seem to find the Mach 3 on grocery store shelves? They either have it stowed away in the back or they are simply out of stock. This is another attempt to steer you away from this perfectly made product. They do this because they know if everyone gets hip to the idea that the Mach 3 will last forever then they will be out of business.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I just purchased a brand new 15 pack of blades which i just received in the mail yesterday. As it is the case that my 46th birthday is next week i figure that this 15 pack will last me till I'm 60 years old. I have an annual ritual of replacing my blade, not because it needs to be replaced, but simply because I want to support the company that has made the most perfect facial hair cutting product ever made ever.", "Razor blades are razor blades these are as good as any others."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003AYTI9W", "title": "Kink Industries Steel Ball Head Penis Ring, 1.5 Inches", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51P8+Bwl8tL._AC_SY606_.jpg", "ratings": "27 ratings", "description": "Feel more during intercourse and when having an orgasm with this Steel Ball Head Ring!

That's not the issue though because once in it felt fine and was looking forward to using it, the problem is that the ball is attached to one end of the ring and the other end is not solid, there's a small space between the end of the ring and the ball. I squeezed some blood into the 'area' and it caused the ring to open very slightly and when released this caused a massive painful pinch of the skin that went into that small space. The ball does spin but I don't think that's where the pinch came from like others have said, its from the fact that one end is open.

I can reach everywhere.", "I could not make up my mind which of two extendable dusters to purchase. So I got them both (since I have a two-story house, it does make it convenient to have a duster on each floor for spider webs!) and am keeping them both. They are similar, but each has a different advantage that I value.\n\nHere are my plusses and minuses, by number of stars, for this duster, the\nEurow Electrostatic Duster with 3 sections extension pole\nand the\nOXO Good Grips Microfiber Extendable Duster\nin a few categories.\nAs you can see, I like both of these dusters!\n\n1. How well does the dust-head work?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The cleaning head is made up of soft filaments. This duster is better at plain old dusting of objects with crevices. For example, we have a set of leather masks hanging on the wall. The very light filaments can be swirled around the masks, fluffing away dust in all the folds and crevices, without in any way damaging the masks. This picks up spider webs and dustballs, but just regular soft dust, in spite of the \"electrostatic\" in the duster's name, is more fluffed into the air.\n***** 5 stars Oxo - The cleaning head is very soft, but the filaments are wider and shorter, more cloth-like, than the extremely soft ones of the Eurow. This makes the Oxo not as good on objects like the masks. However, the Oxo is better on general, and especially on more heavy-duty, dusting. I don't dust as often as I should, so the tops of hanging painting frames, for example, can get quite a layer of dust. The Oxo is better at capturing the thicker dust, rather than just pushing it off of the frames. I don't have a ceiling fan to try it on, but I would think this would work well on dusting the top of the fan blades.\n\n2. How adjustable is the dust-head?\n**** 4 stars Eurow - The head is made with a heavy wire center, rather like a giant pipe-cleaner. This can be bent into a curve or at a soft right-angle, which can be very handy. The wire center is sturdy, though, it's not like you can twist it into a pretzel. And, like a pipe-cleaner, once you've bent it, it takes a bit of work to get it perfectly straight again. (Not that it would make much difference if it isn't perfectly straight.)\n**** 4 stars Oxo - The head itself is not flexible, which, again, can be very handy, especially for more heavy-duty jobs. However, you can easily change the angle of the head using the sturdy button at it's connection to the pole.\n\n3. Ease of extension and adjustability?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The Eurow can go up to 76\", which is a very nice length indeed, especially as it is very light and I have no trouble directing it when fully extended. It isn't long enough to reach the ceiling in the two-story entry-way (without a ladder), but every where else it can handle.\n****+ 4.5 stars Oxo - The Oxo is shorter, extending to 54\" total. I'm only taking half a star off for that because it's length is plenty for most places. The head is heavier than the Eurow's head, but still easy to direct at 54\". However, around anything a bit delicate, the fully extended Oxo, especially as it's dust-catching fibers are shorter, will need a little more care and control.\n\n4. How easy is the dust-head to clean?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The dust-head doesn't come off the pole, but it is super easy to clean. If shaking it off isn't enough, just run it under the tap. Extending the pole is easy; retracting is easy.\n***** 5 stars Oxo - The dust-head is removable, as it's attached with a snap. You can wash it in the machine, or just swish it around in water or soapy water. Extending the pole is easy; retracting is easy. FYI, you can purchase additional/replacement dust heads:\nOXO Good Grips Microfiber Duster Refill\n\nHappy Reader", "The only thing I didn\u2019t like about the duster is that I needed to stop dusting to tighten the extension. Depending on what I was dusting determined how many times I had to stop.\nThe duster did hang onto dust until I got it outside to shake.", "I purchased this duster because I needed one (not because I WANTED one..!!!). Just too many surfaces around the house to attract dust and cobwebs. It seems like you always notice a cobweb by the ceiling at the most inopportune times. Having a long-reach duster is almost a mandatory thing. I researched a bit and decided on this one. The pole uses the typical twist-lock action when you extend and retract it. The brush is soft filament and gets into small crevices and spots quite easily without damaging items or knocking things over. Unless you have a multi-story atrium or open loft area this duster is long enough for everything.\n\nIn use, I found it to be quite excellent. The filament brush head seems to displace most dust without problem... although I am not sure that it \"captures\" all of it.!! I think a bit of the dust ends up in the air and settling on lower surfaces, so always start at the top working down. The cobwebs that always just \"show up\" when you least expect it were no match for this brush head. It captured everything with no problem. When I am finished I take it outside and shake it gently to clean the dust out. If there are any cobwebs left on the brush head I run it under warm water in the sink for a few seconds. The cobwebs rinse away easily. Then back outside to shake gently and hang for about 30 minutes to dry. Good as new....\n\nThe main center stiffener of the brush can be shaped by bending if you need to do so to reach into or onto a specific area. An example would be the top side of a high shelf or maybe even the top of the blades on a ceiling fan. Exercise care on the fan blades though,,, those blades can carry quite a load of dust and sometimes appear to be a little \"damp\" or \"greasy\" if you haven't cleaned them in a month or so. Once you bend the brush to fit, it can be straightened out to its original shape with little effort.\n\nOverall, this duster is a good example of a product that is functions like it was designed. I cannot fault it at all. Sure wish I had purchased one of these years ago.!!", "BETTER THAN COTTON AND EASY TO CLEAN. DECENT EXTENSION. USEFUL TOOL.", "I like everything about it except after awhile it gets a little \"wobbly,\" not sturdy.", "Love the extension handle and picks up dust great! Easy to use and clean.", "We really love this it is easy to use and clean.", "Works very well with rattan fan", "Pleased with the cleaning tool overall and impressed with the short delivery time from ordering to product arriving at my home!", "I wanted a floor duster like my old one..one you could bend and unbend for dusting floors then ceilings. It bent nicely although the duster is not a good synthetic as too stiff and seems cheap. The pole is good but what good is it without a good duster.... the Duster shed it fibers like a cat sheds it's fur in spring. I used it and went out to shake the duster and all I saw was turquoise filaments flying in the air. This product is not something you would want to purchase. I will be returning. Sad because dusting wood or vinyl or any floor is great with mine which is similar to this one but has a much better material for the duster...not thin plastic like filaments as this one does.", "Big brush, long handle", "Must have for my cleaning business to high dust those tall ceiling heights. It's the best tool with the best price", "Worse than any other extendable duster that I've ever used. I've used feather dusters, extendable wands on vacuum cleaners, cotton-covered dusters, dryer brushes to clean out lint...honestly, ANYTHING would be better than this piece of blue junk. The wand has to be screwed in just right, or it will collapse in length. No matter what you do, the head will not stay in place. You can try to hold the head in place with rubber bands...duct tape...a cloth tied around it. Nada. Nothing works. It will just turn and turn, getting loose dust everywhere, if it dusts as all. Forget using this on an angle- if you bend the duster, it will spin and spin, not stay at the angle you set it at. I tried to dust the top of my kitchen cabinets with this- what a mistake! The duster doesn't hold ANY dust- electrostatic, my foot! A plain microfiber cloth is more electrostatic than this thing. A feather duster, heck, even a SWIFFER HOLDS MORE DUST THAN THIS THING! I cannot steer a potential buyer away from this enough. All this thing does is move the dust into the air and onto surfaces below where you dust- and I do mean ALL OVER those surfaces. I have never been more disappointed in a cleaning product or item. I hate leaving negative reviews, but I have no choice here. Buy anything for extended dusting but this darn thing, but save your dollars and don't buy this. Even if the head stayed in place, it just throws dust everywhere, so I would never suggest someone with allergies or asthma use this. It also has a strong chemical smell out of the packing, and sheds little blue threads EVERYWHERE (as if the dust wasn't bad enough...) After using this, it took me an hour to wipe down all of the kitchen surfaces. I expect some dust to fall down- but there's no excuse for this thing to be marketed as electrostatic and hold not one speck of dust in the fibers. But that's what it does. Horrid...", "I have bought several of these types of dusters and none last too long for me. I clean a few houses a week, so mine are used about three times a week for larger houses. The positive was the extension pole, which is very nice and fits on other dusters I've bought. I wasn't crazy about the plastic feel of the fibers (almost like they are recycled from 2 liter bottles, that's the only way I can describe it). They also aren't fluffy, so when you are dusting and the duster is pointed down rather than up in the air, the fibers all fall forward so it's not as conducive to dusting chair rungs and such quickly. As a couple months went by, the fibers do what they all do....get clumpier and stiffer (which means it doesn't flow around delicates anymore) and it didn't pick up dust as well. This would take a longer period of time for those only using it for one house a week, but it didn't last long enough to make it worth it for my purposes. So far, I still prefer quality ostrich feather dusters.", "Sturdyness", "I wanted a duster with a super- long handle so I could clean my 12 foot ceilings without having to stand on a chair to reach them. This duster does reach my ceilings and the pole feels sturdy enough that it won't bend or fall apart as I am dusting. Many reviewers said the duster trapped all of the dust, but that was not the case for me. There was dust on the duster but plenty of dust also fell to the ground. Also, at least for the initial use, the duster shed. But bottom line, my tall ceilings are now cobweb and dust free thanks to this duster.", "Update: It's still holding together well! The epoxy/sawdust mix did the trick!\n\nI clean homes for a living and this is the tool that I use which gives me more grief than any other! Menards used to have a reliable one that would last a long time but they swapped it out for something cheaper. This particular brand was great at first! The adjustable extension pole is a little longer than others I've had and is sturdy and locks in place well. Any new duster is going to shed a bit at first and the fibers will come off when they get caught in cracks and such. Like every other duster that I've had, the duster part of the pole comes loose from the main section because there isn't something solid for it to attach to. So all you have now is a duster that spins around on the top of the pole as you try to firmly dust ceiling fans, baseboards....and anything else. I've now taken it completely off, filled the top plastic section of the pole with sawdust and gorilla epoxy and inserted the top section back in to see if it will make it sturdy again."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B003VD5TMM", "title": "Always Thin Daily Panty Liners For Women, Light Absorbency, Unscented, 162 Count", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71YRqekqcTL._AC_SX569_.jpg", "ratings": "23,753 ratings", "description": "Get a fresh start all day, every day with Always Thin Daily Regular Liners.

Is very sturdy and fits perfectly with my other furniture.", "For the price, this is a pretty decent piece of furniture.\n\nThe good:\nThis looks really nice in my living room. The darker brown of it helps give the appearance of a more sophisticated piece. It also comes with little \"wood grain\" stickers to disguise hardware on the inside to make them unnoticeable on the completed unit. The swing out storage doors were the main thing I was looking for in a TV stand, and they hold a lot of DVDs. Other reviewers indicated that they had damaged pieces but mine was perfectly fine beyond one tiny little scuff that was easily covered with brown marker and was in a spot where it would not be noticed anyway. Other reviewers have also indicated that the build instructions were confusing at times but I didn't feel that that was the case at all.\n\nThe bad:\nEven though the instructions were pretty clear to me, its still going to take a long time to put this together. It took me about 3.5 hours to complete it by myself. The one swinging door sits a little funny (see picture) and bothers me a bit. I'm going to try taking it off and see if I can reposition it. Its not terribly noticeable and it does not hinder the door from opening or closing properly though.\n\nThe ugly:\nIt. Is. Heavy. I'm a small woman so it was very difficult to get this into my house from off my porch. And that was just trying to lift one end enough to pull it over the threshold and then push it in. If you need to get this to another floor of your home, you will either need to be very strong or have someone help.\n\nOverall, with the issues mentioned, I'm still happy with the purchase. It seems to be pretty sturdy, it looks nice, and it has a lot of storage space.", "Well this is my second review, my first review was 1 star, due to the fact that it was delivered with no hardware to put it together. Hardware was sent after trying emails for over a week. It took finding and calling a customer service phone number to get the problem fixed. I was able to assemble it without much difficulty. It is solid wood and well made. It works well in my bedroom and has lots of storage space. Would have been 5 stars if not for the missing hardware and lousy customer service.", "This a good cabinet, but when it arrived it came in a 5\" long box. At first glance it did not look like it was much but when I tried to move the box that the delivery driver left by my door in the rain and did not ring the bell. So I was in a hurry to get it out of the weather. When I heaved it up it stayed down. This was one heavy box, I man handled it inside and just about hurt myself. this is when I realized that this was not a flimsy piece of furniture.\n\nSo I got my dolly and moved it into the living room where I spent the next 3 days putting it together. Now the cabinet came complete with all you need is a screw driver. They advise against the use of power drivers. But there are some 3\" screws that I would not hesitate to use the driver on. as they are quite tight and hard to screw in. So in this respect I deviated from the directions. They even supply you with the glue for the dowels. Here too I deviated and used wood glue that I knew that once applied it was very hard indeed to break the seal.\n\nAs to the directions they are concise in that each is lettered and the directions guide you to put it together by sections. Each one needed to be placed just so, As I later found as i started to put the sections together. As it does not label them as to what is top or bottom or front or rear. So i found myself diassembling sections and switching pieces around as I found when I went to put them together that something would be upside down or facing the wrong way.\n\nMy eyesight is good but only by squinting and staring at the drawings of each section could I see how each deviated from the other. Thus i was able to get it together. I found the putting the doors together was a 2 person job. As they were the last pieces to go on according to the directions.\n\nAs I got close to finishing it i could not help but notice the finish of the wood and how straight it all came together after i figured it all out.\n\nSince finishing I have received many compliments on the cabinet and beauty and quality of it.\n\nIf the directions had been more concise or the pieces labeled better, thus making this a difficult build I would have given this 5 stars.\n\nAs to would I recommend it, I do not hesitate with a yes. As it is very nice piece of furniture especially for the price. But with the warning to pay very close directions to the drawings, and take your time before gluing, be sure each piece fits as it is supposed to.", "Difficult angles to assemble. Took 3 hours. The doors are kind of long and wonky. There\u2019s probably a better one on wayfair for the money.", "Ok so this is the second tv stand I purchased as the first one broke. This is a sturdy stand except it is made from particle board. That is fine for the cabinet portion as it is rally heavy mdf material. However at the bottom there are only 3 pieces of mdf to hold the whole thing up!!! One across the bottom of the front and one on each side. These pieces are held on by wooden dowels glued into holes. So when I moved the stand to clean my window and then tried to push it back in place the bottom piece snapped off and I almost lost my tv.....was quick enough to catch it as the whole stand tipped back!!! I have had this stand for about 2 or 3 years. I ordered another because I really liked it but I made a little adjustment. I gorilla glued a piece of 2 x 4 to each inside bottom corner and I mounted 1.5\" wheels so I can move the stand without putting pressure on the bottom pieces. Problem solved!! If you never move it you will have no problems. If you are occasionally going to move it do what I did or don't put the bottom 3 pieces on at all. Thus the 4 stars vs 5. Hope this helps.", "Tv", "Happy with the purchase, looks great in the room. My mother bought this because she is on a fixed income and couldn't afford to purchase one at the furniture store. She was so happy because it looks just as good as some she saw for around $800 - $900. (of course it is particle board and not solid wood, but you cannot tell when you look at it) Some tips for anyone who orders. Assemble very close to where you plan to use it and make sure you assemble on a clean soft surface. You will want to have an electric screw driver and a soft cloth to wipe away excess wood glue. I suggest you get Gorilla Glue that dries clear, that way if oozes out you won't notice it. (all dowels should be glued)\n\nIt took us 2.5 hours to assemble, but I am very cautious and could have probably done it quicker, but I read the directions at least twice to make sure I had things right. The picture directions are good, but not 100% clear when looking at the placement of a few of the pieces that have several wholes.", "The product came quickly. And it's pretty heavy and that's good. And a ton of parts to assemble and so it takes some patience to do so. The instructions had plenty of pictures to guide through the process. I got toward the end of it when I discovered a drawer part with a slider attached -- and the slider was attached wrong by the manufacturer! It took me a handful of tries to figure out why the drawer was not lining up right and sliding correctly. LOL. However, I managed to unscrew and then rotate the part -- using the same holes and it worked. I am not sure if it'll keep, but it's a fix that I had to do because the manufacturer messed up. I guess I could have returned the whole thing or made demands of the company.\nIn any case, I am happy with the product - with one less star.", "This is solid once assembled and certainly attractive enough for a child's room, den or playroom. The finish, however, is easily damaged.\n\nNow for the assembly: I am a small woman and put it together by myself. First gather patience and count all the parts, including the frame pieces. While putting it together I found that one piece, essentially ornamental, was not drilled properly. Customer service seems good and replacements can be ordered on line (free). Leaving that piece off, I assembled the rest with two sizes of Phillips head screwdrivers. All the hardware was present. Still waiting (next day) for the replacement piece, which I made sure is not essential to install before something else, so I'll add it when it arrives.\n\nSuggestion: Disregard instructions that say to insert the cam locks into the holes first, as it is much easier to join parts and then insert and lock the cam locks. Apply glue sparingly, though there is plenty of it furnished. Make sure dowels are sunk into the holes fully. Also make sure the parts fit tightly together before locking the cam locks. Screws will strip easily, so be careful. Ignore the step where it says to put the top on before the cabinet doors - it's easier to install the doors before the top. The top is the heaviest part and as mentioned, the finish is easily damaged in case the cabinet needs to be laid down to do the doors, and it is easier to install the doors with the cabinet lying on the back. I used one of the foam packing pieces on the floor to protect the finish.\n\nWhile it did take all day for me to assemble this, I proceeded slowly and carefully and ended up with an attractive cabinet that suits my needs quite well.", "I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. It is extremely heavy and sturdy. The one thing I struggled with was the doors. The instructions weren\u2019t 100% clear on applying the hardware, after several attempts I ended up using longer screws because I didn\u2019t apply the hinges properly and messed up the wood. Fortunately, the hinges hide my mistake. Once I got it right everything worked out quite well. My suggestion is make sure you get the hinges on right the first time. All of my pieces were in good condition when it arrived and they sent extra parts in case they were needed. Very happy with my purchase.", "So let's start with the positive:\n\n1) AWESOME TV stand.\n2) The quality of the wood is superior and the styling is great! In my instance it holds, a 47\" LED, 2 speakers, cable box, Blu-Ray player, XBox 360, and wii.\n3) Assembly is pretty straight forward. Took about 2 hours from un-boxing and organizing all of the parts and making sure I wasn't missing anything, to getting it all setup.\n\nNow to the negatives:\n\nInside the doors, it doesn't hold a whole lot and this is the reason why; the door hinges aren't made to hold a whole lot of weight. I originally started loading all of my DVDs in the stand, but after loading them onto the door and shut it, you can clearly see a big gap from the left to the right on the door from the weight of the DVDs. I had to buy a DVD stand which now holds all of my DVDs since it can only hold as many as you can fit in the stand itself (not on the inside door). Thus adding more expense which really shouldn't have happened if they had better hinges to hold the proper weight.\n\nI've tried putting little rubber \"buttons\" on the bottom of the shelf and lifted up on the door when shutting so the door would sit on the button, but that didn't do anything. Plus, it was one more thing to think about when going to get a DVD, making sure to lift up or the button would become unstuck to the bottom.\n\nSo for that reason, I have to rate this at 4 stars for the following points:\n\nStyle: 5 stars\nDesign: 3 stars\nEase of assembly: 5 stars\nFunctionality (for me): 2 stars (due to not being about to use the interior compartments besides the external shelves)", "I like it\nFor my living room\nIt\u2019s perfect exactly what I was looking for", "I have ordered this and one of the part broken when i told to replace they told its back dated and could take a month or so. it took me to 3 hours to assemble this and door was a tough part, and they said you can return if you don't like . first thing it was too small, and could not give a good look.

The \"quilting\" imbossed texture is a sham: it just makes the rolls look fatter and \"fluffy\" and shred more easily. The perforations are hard to see and half the time they fail to tear cleanly, so that bits and pieces and shreds result insteat of a neat tear.

Good gathers around the legs and the are snug at the waist, especially the backside. There have been some 'oh boy' moments - anticipating a leak but NOPE! My only wish is if they could have the color line indicator for wetness but I can actually tell by looking for that telltale yellow front or back (he's breastfed).

We are 3/4 through a case and have been using them for a month.", "This diaper is very economical and does what it needs to do. It doesn't have the wetness indicator but you can feel or smell for yourself if the diaper is wet. Because of its thinness, you can also see clearly when your baby poops.

If your baby has a sensitive bottom, though, I would recommend using another type of diaper. There's a reason this one is cheaper than the others.", "It's no surprise that the product is a good product because I was using it prior to subscribing to it through the Amazon Mom program.

I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home.", "As a new mom, I've tried couple of different brands,, and Pampers is the winner. For this specific one, it's great for the cost, but it does not come with wetness indicator... which is something you can live without.. but the ones with it, help quite a bit. But can't complain when you have to change diaper like 12+ times a day, the cost comes as a big player in purchasing such items.", "I purchased these primarily for the price, but they are a decent diaper. I am using them for my newborn who requires frequent changes. She has had no leakage so far. Overnight, which so far is a max if 4-5 hours, they hold the urine well. They do not blow up when saturated like some other diapers do. I would buy again, especially with the subscribe and save.

Our 5 month old can sleep through the night without waking up for a diaper change in these and only these diapers. The don't sag the way some of the others do. Did I mention how soft they are? I have no idea why some diapers out there are made out of the hardest crunchiest paper ever but these feel like they are made out of fabric.

I LOVE the Pampers Swaddlers because they are soft, almost fabric-feeling. I bought a huge box of the Baby Dry kind because they were a few bucks cheaper, and thank God we are almost out of this box because I hate the plastic texture of the diaper. I guess that's just personal preference since they seem to perform just fine, but I prefer to have a soft little baby butt when I hold my little one, not a squishy plastic butt!", "I was worried about these diapers. I read the reviews AFTER purchasing them. There is no elastic on the back like other diapers I've used so we've had about 3 blowouts that came out the back of them. Most of the time they have worked just fine. My son is a big piddler and he has never leaked through these diapers.", "These diapers are good - nice Sesame Street design, pleasant odor and good size. The one drawback is that they don't have the wetness indicator stripe in the front that I have seen on other Size 1 diapers.

The Baby Dry have been great, except that they are lacking the stripe that turns blue when baby is wet.

No leaks!", "BEWARE!!! Just because the box looks like Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, these are NOT the same. My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max. I won't be buying these again- they simply aren't worth the very little cost savings.", "I have two main complaints:\n1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...\n2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).\nAnyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.\n\nThis review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service. I think Amazon does a fantastic job with that. All shipments arrived before the stated arrival dates with no problems at all!", "I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash.

I had worked in a dry cleaners before, and remembered that there was a device that we used to button shirts quickly(100's per day). So I searched Amazon for a buttoning hook I came across a few options. I was worried about quality if I purchased something inexpensive, and I didn't want it to be flimsy, so I looked for the one that seemed to be the highest quality and usefulness. I sent it to him 8 months ago, and he said it was thoughtful and that was that. Today, seeing him again for the first time since I sent it, he cried(actual tears) about how much he appreciated the gift and how he uses it every day. He was bothered by not being able to do simple things himself anymore, and I was really taken aback by how much this simple device helped him. I would suggest a buttoning hook for anyone having issues with buttons, it's really a life changer, and I think this one is a solid top-notch piece.\n\nHe also told me a story about his trip back from Ireland in August where he was stopped by the TSA and had to show them what it was and how he used it. He got up in front of all of us to tell the story showing us what he showed them, buttoning his pants and shirt. He was chuckling and laughing the entire time. Only bad part is that I have no idea what gift I will get him that will ever follow this up....maybe take his daughter off his hands?", "Fits in pocket", "I purchased this for my work in a retail clothing store.

So, works great at work and home.", "At times, I have problems with small motor control in my fingers. Some call this problem neuropathy. When this happens, I find it difficult to feel small items like buttons and zippers. This makes it very difficult to get dressed unless I wear pants with elastic waists and pullover shirts with no buttons. I have another device that makes shirt buttons a snap to close but it is made of thin wire and will not work to pull heavier buttons like those on jeans and other pants through the button holes. This device has four tools that fold up like a pocket knife. The large hook on the end will pass through the button hole and grab the thread behind the button and pull heavier buttons through the hole with ease This really comes in handy when you want to wear pants. Sometimes a zipper may get stuck down at the bottom after the button is closed and it is difficult to release without reopening the button. This device has a small hook that can reach through the hole in the zipper and with one quick tug it will release the stuck zipper and help to pull it up. This is the first device that I have found to help with those heavier buttons. The tools for small buttons work fine too. But I prefer the lighter weight wire device puller for shirt type buttons.", "Pocket clip is handy but could be a little heavier very easy to use. Big help with jeans", "This works well Afters few attempts each time. The problem I have with it is the blades fold back into the frame too easily.

I was highly impressed with the quality of construction, the fit, and the finish. Every time I pick it up, I marvel at it. The pocket clip can be mounted on the other side of the handle (with Torx type fastener bit) for left or right handers should you want to carry this in your pocket, although the clip itself is too thick and is very stiff for easy use. Best to forget about clipping this to your pocket anyway. The large button hook is indeed perfect for buttoning jeans or heavier fabrics. The key to using the hooks is to rotate the hook device just as it enters the button hole to then get the edge of the button out of the button hole for a quick and easy fasten. The instructions on the back of the package clearly show this rotation technique, which makes the fastening process very quick. I have purchased another of these for my mother who has arthritis in her hands. This tool is more than worth its price. Recommended for anyone who has difficulty grasping buttons and zipper pulls.

I'd be lost without it because I've never been able to get any other button tool to work on jeans & that's all I ever wear.\nOne little mod I've done to this & my other ones is to take a small S hook & crimp it to the strap. Then I hook it in the finger hole when the blade is open.

They're not 100% light blocking but they get the job done, my husband must be part vampire and I'm more of a light and bright type so these are a happy medium \ud83e\udd70 we previously had black blackout curtains and are currently doing some small renovations and redecorating and I couldn't stomach the total darkness anymore so I bought some beautiful linen curtains and white sheers and because they barely shielded our massive living room window from the very hot Oklahoma sun, it not only put a horrible glare on our TV but our window ac unit could not keep up with cooling our very small living room anymore and because I loved the look of the new curtains so much I devised a plan to keep them but had to figure out how to also stop the sun from beating through with such force It could potentially cause spontaneous combustion which is where these come in. I bought a tension rod measured the inside of the window and scoured Amazon for 2 straight days looking for something to fix the problem without taking away from the look of my very light new curtains and something as absolutely cheap, without being cheap, and these fit the bill!!! If you're looking for 100%blackout you'd probably get that with the black or another very dark color of these but I needed a light color and therefore knew it's next to impossible to achieve vampire mode without spending a small fortune. These are very light weight and thin but still do a pretty good job so I'm confident in recommending them. The pictures are at 7:30 am before the sun really starts beating down on our window and the light is off so in the first picture all curtains are closed, the second one is the blackout which are behind the curtains you see are open, and the 3rd is outer curtains open and 1 blackout closed and one open so you can seethe differences, and the dark strip across the top of the window is our feeble attempt at blocking the light without having to buy curtains so we bought window tint which definitely helps but it was not the darkness we needed in order to go window naked so we're currently in the process of trying to find a better quality tint that allows us to see out but nobody see in, however I will say that the tint coupled with these blackout curtains are a good combination, if you made it this far thank you for reading, I apologize for the lengthy review but I wanted to give you an idea of what to expect as I find it quite frustrating when people leave vague reviews like \"it was okay\" or \"these are terrible\" I read a lot of reviews because buying online is scary and I want to know why it was good or what was not so good so I do hope this review is helpful to someone \ud83d\ude00 also my window measurements INSIDE THE FRAME are 52 in length by 75 in wide and I got 2 of the 54 in long white panels which fit perfectly\n\nAlso I purchased these in the lime green and they are a really fun bright green which gave me the pop of funky color I was looking for in my very black and drab bedroom", "Overall I'm happy with these. I bought Ruby and it looks slightly more pinkish-red than the pics, but still very pretty. These have a white* thermal lining, which I wanted, not the black lining of most \"blackout\" curtains available on Amazon these days (I've tried several!). And they're not super-super heavy like all the other \"blackout\" curtains I've tried lately that are \"3 layers\" woven with the heavy black lining. These seem to be doing a very good job blocking light and heat (I need the heat reflection properties most). Although these are not supposed to be 100% blackout, they're more blackout than the so-called 100% blackout curtains I've tried recently. I'm not using them in the bedroom (where I do NEED 100% blackout), so don't need 100%, but I think these would likely work in the bedroom. The length seems accurate, though I haven't unpackaged and hung them all yet to double check that they are all the right length. Did not notice any stitching/construction problems/irregularities (again, haven't yet looked at all of the panels I ordered). There's no awful chemical smell, even with the curtains getting very hot hanging on a very sunny south-facing window.\n\nThose are all problems I've been having with other so-called blackout curtains I've been trying that I'm NOT having with these, which seems miraculous. They were also quite inexpensive.\n\nMy only real concern is trying to wash these because of the stiff, plastic-y material (especially the \"foam\" thermal liner backing). I've had similar thermal-backed Eclipse curtains over the years, and even though they are supposedly washable/dryable, sometimes they have kind of fallen apart when washed (bits of lining comes off) or the lining sticks to itself... so, I may not try to wash them (that goes against my nature!). They are quite wrinkled, even after hanging for a few days, so I might try to steam them rather than risk washer (cold) and/or dryer (low) for wrinkles.\n\nThese are definitely not gorgeous, soft, flowy curtains, but no blackout curtain is. They do have some nice texture and are matte-finished, unlike all the weird plain super smooth and \"shiny\" blackout curtains I've tried during my search over the past couple of months. And these Ruby curtains are much nicer looking than most of the drab or weird-looking grey/beige/brown blackout curtains commonly available online.\n\n*[Update note: after opening my remaining panels--all are Ruby red, I discovered the white thermal back lining is actually slightly pink on some of them, though it does not at all look like these were previously used/washed. I'm not sure why/how the white lining turned a bit pink. I'd prefer the backs were all really white for better heat reflection, but hope these slightly pink ones will still work well.]", "I used this to separate rooms in a doorway instead of a door. It's great and I love it it does the job!! It's thick enough. You can spray some water on it to get the wrinkles out and pat and a run you hands through it like an iron with just water and your hands. I would not use an iron on this material it could melt or if you do use a towel over it and iron on very low . It's real lifesaver . We moved into a place with no door. It helps with privacy and I bought a short one so the cats can go right under it with out have to worry . They walk under the drapes and air circulates under it. I almost didn't buy this place because the was no door on the bathroom and I'm not handy.", "These are a great value and an excellent choice if you need to keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. They're also ideal if you need to shield your bedroom from outside light, to get a good night's sleep (or if you're napping during the day).\n\nSo far, we've only used these drapes in the summer, and in bay windows that receive the afternoon sun. Since summer 2022 was beastly hot, we needed all the help we could get, to keep our a/c bills low and our apartment comfortable.\n\nFrom our tests, it looks like these lower the room's temperature about 15 degrees (F), compared with no curtains on the window, just thin plastic blinds.\n\nAlso, these drapes are made from fabric that looks nice. The ivory color brings a touch of elegance, and the workmanship is pretty good. Some of the stitching may not bear close scrutiny, but I'm not sure why a visitor would be looking that closely anyway.\n\nFor the price, I think these drapes are a really good deal. We may buy more for other rooms, not for insulation, but simply because they look so nice and keep excess light out.", "They\u2019re the exact shade of pink I wanted but as you can see from the picture on a semi cloudy morning A LOT of light shows through. It gives my room a pinkish glow which is cool.\nYou can not see through the curtains, so sheerness gets 5 stars. The curtains have a decent weight to them so they should be energy efficient.

You can\u2019t see through it, and it keeps out light very well. They also stop drafts and winds from coming through and are made of a nice, durable material. I highly recommend the purple ones! I got the super long length too - the \u201c84 inch ones.", "I ordered the white but they seem light grey. I was surprised at the weight of the panels as my expectations were kind of low. I think these will serve the purpose of keeping the room warmer this winter.", "They are fine for blocking the light. However, I attempted to steam the wrinkles and they didn\u2019t come out. I washed them according to the instructions, line dried, and ironed on liw heat but they are still wrinkled.", "I purchased the \"cafe\" color, expecting that it would be a light brown. However, I found the color to be more in the gold family of colors, especially when up against a true, light, neutral, brown wall. Also, the yellow tones of the curtains are a bit cool, thereby clashing with the warmer undertones of the brown. The fabric itself is very nice, looks much more expensive than it actually is. The back side of each curtain is white, which is also nice. And, I was impressed by how lightweight each panel is. I exchanged the cafe for the ivory and found that the ivory was just pretty white actually, which is fine. My difficulty is that this fabric looks and feels like a form of plastic. They are still lightweight and with a white backing, but I fear that they will look cheap once hanging on the windows. I'm sorry to say I am returning the ivory as well.", "I really like the way the curtains look. Not so sure yet if they are energy efficient or how well they block out the light since the curtains are in a spare bedroom. They probably aren't the best. BUT for the money, you can't beat it. I am pleased with the purchase.", "I was looking for lime green curtains with rod pockets and was happy to find these at a great price for my daughter. They are a great green color and they are also a good blackout curtain. They are a decent quality, definitely good for the price.", "I like these. I purchased these to replace the ones I left at my old house. I love the color and you cannot see through them. Good value and they give privacy in the rooms. They are also energy efficient. No draft.", "I love these curtains! Not exactly what I was expecting when I bought them but I fell in love with them the picture doesn\u2019t even do them justice. I haven\u2019t noticed yet any changes in if it keeps our heat in but checking that soon \ud83d\ude1d", "I\u2019m going to put them up when I change my summer curtains to the winter ones. I\u2019m in the process of installation my windows first. I live in apartment building where the heat is limited.", "I will be purchasing again for my bedroom. They work great for blocking out light.", "These are good quality, and they block light well enough. I got them to darken my toddler\u2019s room in the summer, and it works for that. The only thing I dislike is how hard it is to open them. They are lined with a rubbery plastic coating, which is also inside of the rod pockets, so they are really difficult to pull open. I\u2019m not able to lift them up as I try to slide them open because there is a small toy shelf in front of the window, but maybe it would be easier to open if I could lift and slide at the same time.", "Of course the material is a little stiff/rough but that\u2019s ok bc it isn\u2019t expensive! The purple doesn\u2019t let in sunlight, the teal does a little! The grey is a different brand\u2026 overall good buy!", "They're nice white curtains that let light in during the day but definitely not true blackout, or even close to \"potential\" blackout curtains. They do look great in person though. However, it was a pain to have to place 2-3 orders for the amount of sheers needed as the company has a limit of 3 per purchase.", "Not sure what u was expecting but it's not bad honestly", "Very good quality fabric and bright color!

I start with that so that you will all learn from my experience with this product. My wife was on a mission to find a product that would help with her facial acne and redness. I was at Whole Foods one day and asked an expert to recommend a product for my wife. She quickly recommended this saying that Resveratrol was great for acne. I bought it on the spot.\n\nI should also tell you that I myself am a product junkie. Every since I was in my 20's I have been cursed with horrible razor rash / burn on my neck after I shave. Because I am 1/8th Hungarian, I have a very very quick growing beard. I am always on the lookout for a product that will cure this. And trust me when I say I have tried every-single-product out there. Everything from the high end, to the low end, the all natural, the organic, every single mens only line of products... I have tried them all.\n\nThen I come home with this. I tell my wife to put it on her face before we go to bed. Just to be funny I also applied it to my neck, jokingly saying, \"Hey what if this product actually works?\"\n\nWe did this together for a week, each night applying the cream, her to her face and me to my neck.\n\nThen I shaved. I had let my beard grow a little bit, normally I shave twice a week. I shaved like I normally do, got out of the shower (I always shave in the shower, if you are not doing this then you are doing it wrong my friend) and looked at my neck.\n\nMy neck was razor rash/burn free! Ok, not 100% but like at least 80% better then the last 15 years of shaving! I was astonished! I had actually found a product that worked!\n\nMy wife you ask? How was her redness and acne. Well, she got results too. Far less redness and breakouts.\n\nBut the real winner here is me! I not longer have razor burn. I bought more of this here on Amazon. I use it every night on my neck. My neck looks so much more attractive... I know that sounds funny, but I have had a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years! NOW IT'S GONE!\n\nGet this for any guy suffering from the same affliction as me. Trust me!", "Arrived on time exactly as described.
