                "Have been using Gillette Foamy Shave Cream formulated for 'Sensitive Skin' for many years. And for just as long, have always set the can in the sink of medium hot water to warm up the cream before shaving. Never had one explode yet! My last order (from a different vendor) were different in the fact that there were no foil/paper labels on the cans, the labels were directly printed on the metallic cans and I never had to worry about the labels peeling off in the hot water. I noticed that this set of shaving cream have the foil/paper labels, so I suspect they are going to peel after a couple of uses, but no big deal. Just wish there would have been a way to know this before ordering.",
                "I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel. I didn't know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too. Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!). I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I've used in the past. However, as other reviewers have noted, it's not as \"rich\" or full-bodied when it comes out of the can. The 'instructions' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams). Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it's good foam, and I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the 'watery' consistency when it comes out of the can. This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).\n\nIn summary:\n* If you like foam, you may like this one. 3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.\n* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won't like it. However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you'd like it.",
                "I've been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I'm out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren't even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number people you have.\n\nIn terms of the cream itself, I'm a big fan of foam over gel as you don't have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette's is good at all that. I don't have sensitive skin, but I've always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.\n\nEverything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).",
                "Nice value for the dollar.\nNot sure what \"sheerness\" and \"thickness\" have to do with shaving cream so I can't \"rate\" them.\nI've used this cream exclusively for some time and it works well.",
                "This is a great shaving cream foam. Was worried it was going to be the gel.",
                "Gillette Sensitive Skin is my \"go-to\" brand when traveling and being able to grab six of them at slight less than $3.25 each rather than $2.30 for singles makes it easy for me to stock up. It is like getting almost three FREE cans with a three can purchase. Shelf life is not a problem either if kept in a cool place. No, the garage is a bad idea as is over the stove or on the mantle above the fireplace. This is a good deal.",
                "I wasn't able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value. I haven't experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it's perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use. Take note, this is a foam, not a gel, and it comes out all foam. I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation. Not much you can say...it's shaving foam. It is what it is.",
                "I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular. Then recently, by accident, I picked one of these Gillete foam styles off the store shelf. Because I didn't realize my mistake until a couple of weeks later, I decided to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I'm speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.",
                "The can looked like the one he likes however it wasn't the gel he thought it would be. He still uses it and says it's ok.",
                "The item arrived when I was notified it would arrive - in a timely manner. Looks like I am all set with shaving cream for the near future.",
                "I've used Gillette Series foam for years...have never been a fan of gels. I get a great shave with the foam, and with a lot less mess, and a lot less odor. I can't believe that a product as good as this is so hard to find. Well, not anymore with Amazon.",
                "I ordered this six pack in 2012 and JUST popped open that sixth can. So keep that in mind if you're trying to order in bulk to save money, this purchase is probably way longer term than you're thinking. Also, I thought I was buying the gel, but this is the cream.",
                "Couldn't find this in Walmart or Riteaid anymore so looked for it on amazon. Had to buy the six pack, but since it doesn't really expire I'll be set for a few years, haha. I like this cream because it doesn't clog my Gillette fusion razor like the foaming gel does.",

                "This stuff is classic, works great and is impossible to find anymore even in the million drugstores of NYC. I hope they are not dis-continuing the product. It seems only the razor-clogging gels are being sold in NYC these days, so I had to buy 6 cans of these just so I could get what I wanted!",
                "Been using these for years now. A little goes a long way. Comes out like water then foams up. This is important to note so that you do not dispense too much after thinking there was no foam coming out. I find it better to shake the can 2 or 3 times (not excessively) to make it foam up quicker.",
                "This product is great. The price was right and the shaves are great."

                "The deodorant works well but you must turn a knob on the bottom to get it out and in the beginning it is impossible to turn. I was disappointed that I bought this.",
                "I have struggled with hyperhydrosis my whole life. I was bullied in school for my large pit-stains, and would always have wet circles under my pits, regardless of the temperature outside. I went through several prescriptions from my doctor, which only irritated my skin and made it itch and burn like fire, preventing me from sleep. I received a sample of this product through a female care sample pack through a clinic, and fell in love. I have now been using this deodorant for almost 10 years, and have never been happier with a deodorant. Yes, I still do sweat if it's really hot out, or while working, but that's to be given with any deodorant I believe. Applying this product at night and in the morning has solved the huge wet circles I was always embarrassed of.\n\nAlso, this product smells fantastic, and has not irritated my skin even after applying twice daily. I am so happy with this, that i haven't, and won't search for anything else. This is it for me!",
                "I was given a trial of this somewhere. I forgot about it and when I used it, it was a bit dry and hard to get out, but worked well. Now that I have a fresh one, it it much nicer to use! I only roll it up one \"click\" and put it on; you don't need much. But, my complaint is how darn hard it is to turn that dial, If you have hand issues, this may not be for you. I do not like smells in my products, but bought this because people said the smell was light and i either couldn't find or didn't want the fragrance free one (cannot remember now). The fragrance is not bad. It is lighter than many and doesn't smell for long. That said, if you are sensitive to fragrance, it is noticeable when you put it on.\n\nHave no idea how long it will last - given it's price, I hope longer than the last kind I used.",
                "Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out. This deodorant, seriously changed my whole life. I have always been a sweaty armpit person (not a smelly sweaty, but constant sweat), and was SO insecure about it. All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn't like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter. I put this on after showering, and don't have to reapply until my next shower, even if that is two days later. I thought maybe I grew out of the problem, but have tried over the years not using it, and a couple of times have forgotten it when I traveled, and I definitely still sweat like crazy. No other deodorant works even a little for me. This is THE ONLY one I can use with success. And it smells awesome! People sometimes ask me what perfume I'm wearing, and I tell them it's my D.O., haha. I don't like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the 'powder' scent (gag).",

                "This has been my favorite deodorant for years, but now that we\u2019ve moved from the desert to a warm humid climate this is a life saver. I\u2019ve tried switching to the more natural (aluminum free) deodorants that everyone raves about, but I end up smelling and with soaked T-shirt\u2019s. Secret clinical strength never fails me, and I love the fresh light scent that doesn\u2019t overpower. I can wear this deodorant on a day I\u2019m nauseous no issues, and if I\u2019m wearing perfume it doesn\u2019t clash like some stronger smelling brands of deodorant have in the past.",
                "Can go up to 2 days without sweating ..I've tried natural deoderants and aluminum free but I hate the feeling of wet pits..keeps me super dry and the smell is so fresh ..my favorite..definitely worth the cost",
                "I love this deodorant. The smell is delicate and pleasant. It works well. I had to wait 4 weeks to get it but it was worth the wait.",
                "I dislike the overpowering fragrance of most depressant but I appreciate a light scent versus unscented. This is the perfect balance and it does and excellent job",
                "It's a very good product and does what it says so long as you follow directions. I used this in preparation for a summer wedding and I'm so glad I did. Just remember you have to start using well before the date of your event in order for it to be fully effective though I have used it on shorter notice occasionally and it still seems to work fine. Amazon occasionally has a coupon that can make this really cheap so clip it and just add one of these to your prime or free shipping order since it's an add-on item and will only cost a few bucks. It's worth it to have one on hand when you need it.",
                "i'm somewhat disappointed with the scent. To me, it really doesn't smell like lavender. Now I wish I'd gotten (if they have it) the \"clean\" scent in the clear gel. The scent It isn't bad, I just wanted something \"pretty\" like my last one (which was called \"Paris\"). But, I didn't see that one. As for the antiperspirant part, it's decent but could be better.",
                "Have used this for years bit was buying in Amazon. This sounded like a good scent. I needed some and like it. It is not a heavy scent",

                "Useful and easy.",
                "Wasn't sure of the directions at first, of it was two clicks for each arm or one for each. The feeling of the deodorant is a little strange at first, but it does feel dry when it goes on, almost too dry.\n\nI reapplied about half a click to both arms in the morning because I didn't trust it to last throughout the next day as well and I was right. I was sweating all day and smelled by the end of the day. Now this could be because I didn't use it right, I'm not sure. These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.\n\nI will increase two two clicks each arm day and night. This means I will be out of deodorant by next week probably with tiny amount that's in there, but it's worth a try.",
                "I am trying out new deodorants because my old, reliable deodorant, Arrid XX Dry changed its formula. I tried Secret because it's the best seller on Amazon. So far this product is just okay. Good points:\n- The lavender scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.\n- It seems to keep me smelling fresh.\n\nI'm not giving it a higher rating because:\n- The gel is extremely sticky/tacky and stays that way all day without ever absorbing into my skin although I apply a very small amount (1-click). I wash it off before bed because the stickiness is unpleasant.\n- It transfers to my clothing, leaving a dark, hardened spot on the fabric, which is very undesirable. I let it dry for about 30 minutes before dressing and it still transfers.",

We only make organic tampons because most are made from a mix of rayon and non-organic cotton, and are commonly chlorine-bleached. Tampons often have a plastic wrapper, contain perfumes and even dyes. Rayon is a highly absorbent fibre which rapidly absorbs menstrual blood but at the same time can also dry out the natural protective mucous lining of the vagina. No-one should be exposed to pesticide residues, phthalates, azo-dyes and dioxins, especially in such a sensitive and absorptive part of the body. Know exactly what you put in your body.",

These are the shape of old school tampex tampons where as the non applicator ones are shaped like OB\u2019s . These do the job and are high quality but the ones without the applicators are more discrete (for sex, etc.) and comfortable.",

                "I used OB tampons for years in an attempt to reduce the amount of waste produced by my tampon habit. After you get used to the lack of an applicator, it's really no big deal. Then, after considering the health implications of putting synthetic materials and chemically treated cotton into my body, I made the switch to organic tampons about 10 years ago. Not only would I rather have organic cotton in by body than synthetics for obvious reasons of preferring natural materials, but I've also read that they pose less risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. I've tried a number of brands, but have found NatraCare to be my favorite for their ease of use, price, and ready availability on Amazon.\n\nOne of my favorite things about these is that they are constructed well. As they absorb fluid, they unfold in a flower sort of shape that catches everything very efficiently. I can count on them to work, no matter what I'm doing. The tiny little individually wrapped tampons are also super discreet, and can fit into any little pocket without causing a scene. I've been using these for nearly 3 years, and will continue to buy!",

Not to mention the fuzz that comes off the tampon just from pulling out the string. So 1. You can\u2019t even insert it and 2. If you somehow manage to, you\u2019re going to have fibers left over inside that will be prone to infection. Don\u2019t waste your money.

I was able to get it all out and nothing bad happened.\nRegardless, I am a little more wary of it now using anything over the \"normal\".\nI will still use the product. It's one of the better organic tampons that I have used!",

I knew a girl in high school (the '80's) who got TSS. I started using organic tampons about 5 years ago. I was lucky all those years using mainstream brands. Please Google \"TSS Woman Loses Leg\" and you will understand why I insist on using an organic tampon. These Natracare tampons are much like O.B.'s but they are made with organic cotton. In terms of price, they are not much different in cost than O.B.'s and most other mainstream brands. If you care about using this kind of product, Natracare is a good choice. I know some women prefer to use tampons with an applicator. I've never tried the Natracare brand but they do make those too.",
                "Product itself seems fine, but it made me really uncomfortable that all three boxes came already opened and then secured with packing tape from some third party. To be honest it made me wonder if this was an authentic item or if it was someone trying to replicate. Would be curious if others had this experience?",
                "Not what I expected. I'm ok with the non applicator but it's hard to get the wrapper off, the cotton can come loose when trying to grab the string and the string is so flimsy, I worried I might not be able to get it out at some point.",
                "easy to put in and feels good; notice that my period cycles are shorter and lighter when using 100% cotton period products",
                "These do not have the push insert they are just plain. I prefer the ones with the paper inserts. Have used this brand for years and like them bc of no bleach etc in them. I just ordered the wrong box.",
                "The wrappers are hard to open, and the cotton falls apart by the string as you attempt to untangle the string from the bottom to be able to insert it. The absorbency does not compare to other brands in the same category. I will not purchase again.",
                "These work really good. Obviously, the no applicator is a bit messy at times, but the other organic cardboard applicators are so tricky to get right all the time. This product eliminates that issue. They are still organic cotton, which is my main requirement. They are comfy, don't leak, inconspicuous, and I would buy them again (if they're prime)."

The dual-action formula starts working in seconds and lasts longer than Tums.** Whether at brunch or a new food spot, use Pepcid Complete Mint Chewables for fast-acting relief so you don't have to worry about hurting now or hurting later. * Based on 9-hour acid control studies during the day and 12-hour acid control studies during the night.

                "Great for my small business So much cheaper than those rules",
                "I recently started using these types of towels in my kitchen as a replacement for my paper towel rolls, figuring might be a better value so we can use paper towels to dry our hands instead of hand towels, thereby reducing cross contamination of germs and maintaining a little more clean environment in the house. I tried these hoping they would be an economical version - while they are less expensive, I find that because they are thin and hard and not so absorbant, that I am using 3x the number of towels as normal. I really did not like these towels and felt I would rather pay a little more and get a better quality towel... Sorry, but that's how I feel in regards to using these BASIC towels for home use as a replacement for paper towels. BUT that being said....... if these are to be used for the workshop to clean stuff, or somewhere else like a shop bathroom, they may be a perfect and economical towel. So to summarize....... in my opinion, if you want these as a replacement for paper towels/home use, don't get this particular version, you will probably be disappointed like I was (which is why I gave it so few stars) But if you want them for some other use, they might be great. You have to decide based on your needs whether these will work for your purposes or not.",
                "GREAT PRICE & Great value",
                "Cheap, much thinner, much less value. Poor quality. The only good thing was the fit in the holder better.",
                "I like this product. It's just what they said in the write up. When we pull out of the dispenser, they pull out linked like they should. I\"ll buy again.",
                "These papers towels are terrible! I always buy white three ply paper towels and these are the worst! Unless I got a defective batch!",
                "I ordered this case of paper towels around mid-March 2020 when paper towel rolls started to disappear online and at brick & mortar stores. Realizing that I was running out of options fast, I turned to shopping for these bulk paper towels as a still reasonably priced alternative.\n\nI was expecting 2 ply paper towels but soon realized that they were only 1 ply when I inspected the product upon delivery. Nevertheless, this product served its purpose as replacements for paper towels rolls and disposable table napkins.\n\nIt's now close to the end of June 2020 and we still have a lot of these paper towels left. I packed the bundles separately in plastic wrap to protect them from moisture, contamination & pests. This also made it easier to store the paper towel bundles in our kitchen cabinets, instead of leaving them inside the box that they were shipped in.",
                "These remind me of the paper hand towels you find in common bathroom at a small office. Great if you go through a lot of hand towels. Absorbancy - well they suck water up fast but are super thin when they do. Idea for drying hands not wiping up spills or using as napkins outdoor in the summer bbq time.",
                "I bought these because all the stores are out of paper towels. These are like the old fashioned ones you used to get out of paper towel dispensers except they are white. They are single-ply so not too thick, and not as absorbent as Bounty, but they do the trick.\n\nI was able to clean all surfaces in my home and did the windows, too. You get 16 packets of paper towels so these will last a long time. Each piece is 9 inches x 9 inches, so a bit smaller than my regular paper towels, but they work fine.\n\nMy order came in 5 days during the midst of the shortages. Would highly recommend.",
                "I ordered this for my clinic/shop, and unfortunately, my staff did not like the lack of strength. They reported to me that the paper towels did not hold up as well as they need, and would rip or break up faster than what they were accustomed to when we were ordering a pricier paper towel brand. So, I switched to another brand that is slightly more resistant to tearing and falling apart. However, let me say this: I used these paper towels on occasion and found them to be a nice texture, albeit slightly thin. If you don't need heavy duty paper towels, these might work for you. It just didn't work for our needs because we perform clinical services and the paper towels weren't strong enough under those circumstances. Perhaps they might work better for home use, though.",
                "They are soft, absorbent and a value for the money.",
                "I normally use Viva or Brawny but during these times found it not economical. The paper towels are very useful and sturdy. Its your normal commercial type paper towel. It is not Super absorbent, however it will absorb small amounts at a time. I use it in the bathroom in lieu of hand towels and I use it in the kitchen.\n\nIt has proved to be very economical. Use it to clean counters or pick up messes on the floor. It doesn't tear apart.\nOverall great product.",
                "These are great if you are looking for a large bulk of paper towel-napkins. Each lot is wrapped in brown paper until you want to use them. They aren't the best absorbers, as they are thin and papery. Yet, for a quick hand dry or such, they do the trick.",
                "Not as soft as I would like but during the times of Covid and the lack of paper products, I ordered these. They\u2019re a good value and couldn\u2019t go wrong with trying them. Plus it came right to my door! Thanks Amazon!",
                "These are, I am quite sure, made from recycled paper. There is nothing wrong with that. I use regular paper towels very often, for various cleanup tasks. These multi fold paper towels are used for drying my hand# for whatever reason, and for quick cleanups of certain liquids. They are perfect for that. I find myself now using them for more things. Sure use a lot less, off the more expensive , paper towels this way.",
                "I have these sitting in my bathroom, my kitchen and anywhere there is a sink to wash hands or dry up spills. During the pandemic these are essential to me! I have spread the word more people need to be using these at home not just at the office. They are reasonably priced and a quality product.",
                "Bought these because no store had paper towels and we just got two puppies that were having accidents. These paper towels are industrial style paper towels that you see at work or businesses. They don\u2019t really absorb much and are not the softest but I knew this before I bought them. If you are buying them for your business or just to dry hands like you\u2019re supposed to, then they are perfect but if you need them to wipe things up, I would look elsewhere.",
                "put the towels in a plastic container that has a tight lid. Use 70 percent alcohol, a few drops of dish soap, and enough water to cover the towels. Ratio I use is 3 parts alcohol to 1 part water.",
                "These are fine to clean up a spill, but I prefer a towel that is more absorbent and has a less papery feel. I would say these are slightly better than the brown paper hand towels you would find in a gas station rest room."

Light some candles, play some nice music (spa, jazz, whatever), grab the massage oil - your wife will love you.\n\nSorry for the double review, consider me inspired by recent memories of using this massage oil.",
                "Massage oil arrived as expected. Good, sanitary packaging made us confident in the quality of the product. Texture is great. It is oil based obviously so I'd recommend putting down a towel or other protective cover before applying so as not to ruin blankets/sheets or upholstery. Does not get tacky and rubs in easily. My wife does wish the scent was a bit stronger but otherwise the scent is very pleasant and we enjoy using it.",
                "Same as above",
                "The chair cover was better than I expected!!!",
                "I love this oil and I have been buying it for years. The scent is very nice and mild. It is not overpowering. I use it on my legs to moisturize especially when I wear shorts. It's good for dry skin. It's nice to use for a back rub too!",
                "The sweet almond SCENT and FEEL is luxurious ! Glides on so smooth and has a light sweet almond essence. Been using it for years. Cannot live without it!",
                "This is a perfect massage oil. Soft calming scent that leaves skin feeling great. Highly recommend this product. This one is worth a perfect 10 in my scorebook.",
                "Nice easy scent. Great for massage.",
                "It's lubricant, and works as it should. However, I didn't think it was as enticing as advertised. I think it was used once or twice before we pretty much lost/left/and or forgot about it. I'm 100% sure there are better options out there. Not saying that it won't do it for others, or that it wasn't worth the money, it just didn't do much more than some cheap ol' KY would do.",
                "Love this product. A little goes a long way.",
                "Great feeling massage oil and i totally love the smell.",
                "The wife loves it... that's all that matters. Perfect for a massage!",
                "So excited that this smells just as I remembered from years ago. I actually love the smell to wear it as a perfume scent! \ud83d\ude01",
                "Best smelling oil ever!"

                "I really like this gel! My face is partly oily and partly dry. This balances the look and feel of my skin very well and in a lasting way. If I use it in the shower in the morning, my skin still feels good late into the evening. I had little subsurface white bumps under my eyes and this gel has eliminated them over time. I am in my seventies and anyone I meet who has a reason to know my age is surprised I am not in my fifties! Part of that is genetics, but a good share of that is the condition of my skin. Even my dermatologist is impressed!",
                "I like the ingredients. They are better than a lot of supposedly \"natural\" face washes out there. I love the way the gel feels as you rub it on your wet face. It doesn't lather WHICH IS GOOD, people! It doesn't have to lather to work well! It feels very hydrating as you wash, and the smell is predominently a fresh aloe vera smell for those who have had a real aloe vera plant and used it (aside from the very light citrus undertones which dissipate quickly and are not strong because they aren't synthetic perfumes) . It does feel a little drying once your face is dry but definitely clean, and nothing a little serum or moisterizer corrects. I am 30, have never had an issue wih breakouts mainly because I let my face rest: I don't wash it every day, I don't put a ton of products on it every day. I go bare-faced as much as possible and let my pores stay unsuffocated. As a result, my face stays clear and wrinkle free so far. I use this cleanser maybe twice a week, no more, and only to cut the grime and any sweat that settles on my face after general living. But for me, this cleanser fits the bill and feels wonderful.",
                "I really like this organic face cleanser. It smells wonderful and my face feels cleaner and softer afterwards. My only complaint is that it comes in a plastic bottle and I don't know where I could refill it.",
                "I have been using this product for years but have been having difficulty finding it. I am so glad that Amazon carries it, and I got on the replenishment program, now a new bottle shows up right as I am running out of one. Thank you for taking the hassle of having to run around to different stores out of my face care routine. I have tried many face washes, some don't leave your face feeling fresh, or they leave a sticky film. This wash is perfect. I can't tell if it is brightening my face, I just like how it leaves my skin feeling, clean.",
                "This stuff is great for my oily skin but doesn\u2019t seem over drying where my face is completely dried up with alcohol or something. It\u2019s a slippery gel type of consistency and it melts off my foundation. It smells like straight-up, real, fresh orange peels. I\u2019ll lather and leave it on my face in the shower after my pores have opened up a bit and it will start tingling and slightly stinging but not in a bad way .. as if I can feel it settling into my pores to deep clean. I\u2019ll rinse with cooler water and my face looks brighter and a bit smoother too as if it eats a little bit of dead skin off of your face. I have very oily acne prone skin.",
                "I like this cleanser - it does a good job of cleaning without stripping my face dry. My skin can be sensitive, but i have never had a reaction to this. The gel consistency keeps it on my silicone scrubby pads without falling off into the shower , and it foams up just enough - dense but not extravagant and hard to rinse off.",
                "I\u2019ve been using this product for about 3 years now. The store I used to buy it from stopped carrying it, so I decided to start buying online. I love this for my combination oily skin. I can see the difference after using it and how my skin looks brighter after use. And it doesn\u2019t feel either oily or dry after use. Skin just feels clean. I have significantly less breakouts now. And, I\u2019m convinced the vitamin c is keeping my skin looking young as people always seem to think I look about 10 years younger than I am. This is especially important to me, because I haven\u2019t always had nice skin. I recommend this to others. I tried the cream based one in the same colored bottle, but didn\u2019t care for it as I felt it left a greasy residue on my skin. Make sure to get this gel and not the cream.",
                "I really like this product. I have used it for over a year. I can't say anything about the price it used to be a year ago, but look around the interwebs.",
                "Out of nowhere my face has become sensitive to everything and seems like all products lead to breakouts. I kept trying so many different cleansers that I finally decided to try soaps I previously used when I was younger with acne. This is a pretty reliable soap for me. Prevents pimples and feels like I get a good clean. It's a tiny drying though, but I have found that's pretty typical with vitamin c cleansers or cleansers that prevent pimples. So I would rather have to moisturize than have pimples. The scent is nice. It's sweet smelling almost like a sweet cereal like fruit loops.",
                "I Love This Product and it is a powerhouse product. I purchased this product because I had a breakout on my face and my daughter gave it to me to continue my face healing from the breakout that I had. This product has works beautifully for me and I will continually using it and I have continually seen results on my skin. I am ecstatic with this product and what it has done for me and the smell is very pleasant and citrus. 2 Thumbs Up",
                "Have not been able to find this anywhere lately for a decent price let alone the toner . These are the only products i can use on my sensitive skin . Please make more amd lower the price !",
                "I have oily acne-prone skin even though I\u2019m over 70. I\u2019ve tried many face cleansing products and they were too perfume-y or left something on my skin. This cleanser is perfect. However when I bought it in March 2021 it was $9 for an 8oz bottle but now, July 2021, it\u2019s over $27 for the same size. So it tripled in price! Unfortunately I had to switch products. If you can afford the current price then buy it because it\u2019s a good product. I would have given it an overall five star rating except for the price.",
                "This, and the toner of the same product line, are probably the best facial products I have ever bought. I saw immediate results in lightened pigmentation (freckles, sun spots, left over pregnancy mask). My skin loves these products. The first time I used the toner, it felt and looked like it was burning my skin a bit so I took a wet washcloth and washed it off. However once the redness went away, my skin looked amazing! I realized that the toner is just really strong, so after that, I diluted it with water and saw less irritation, but still great results. The cleansing gel is much milder but still effective (I backed off the toner after the first time and was just using the gel alone for a few weeks). Since I now know that my skin handles the gel well, I typically scrub it into my face at the start of my shower and leave it there until I am ready for a final rinse. I follow up with the toner when I feel I need it. I have been getting so many compliments lately about how great my skin looks. I am hooked and especially love that it's mostly natural!",
                "I\u2019ve been using this face wash for years. I love that it cleans my face at night without over-drying it, and I love the scent. I am really scent-sensitive, but the fresh orange smell of this is lovely. It removes most of my makeup, will leave behind just a tiny bit of eyeliner under my eyes that I can then wipe away with a tissue after I dry. I follow this cleanser with a Retinol serum and the Avalon Organics Intense Defense moisturizer. In the mornings I use the Avalon Organics Cleansing Milk.",
                "Love the product but when it came it was leaking out everywhere. Once I got it cleaned up and used it I enjoyed the invigorating citrus feel on my skin. Wish I got to have a full bottle!",
                "My face has the classic \"combination skin\" - oily in some places, dry in others. Moreover, it's facial skin on the body of a 50-something lady.\n\nI hate paying top dollar for small quantities of face care products. I also need products that require the least amount of my effort or time.\n\nI looked long and hard for a good facial cleanser that is reasonably priced. I navigated quite a few bad products along the way, several of which were not cheap. Very few facial cleansers left my face feeling \"Clean but not stripped\".\n\nThis product does this for me - my face feels clean, refreshed but not stripped or dry after. I pair this cleanser with a very light moisturizer and this combination works really well for me. One of these bottles lasts me quite a long time.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that the bottle doesn't travel as well as I'd prefer. It's one of those that you have to turn the nozzle, pumping out the current contents of the pump, in order to lock it. And if you mess-up the first time, you get to pump out yet another squirt while you try to lock it (before packing it in your suitcase). This is the only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5.",
                "The scent, the texture, the way my face feels (moisturizes, not drying), the price - it all comes together in this product. It works!",
                "With my combination skin (some parts oily and some parts dry), I prefer a gel cleasner. I was originally introduced to Aveda's gel cleanser which is what got me started on that type. Recently I was using one from a company called Lemongrass Spa, but with it being a direct sales company it was a little pricier that I wanted. And no free shipping...and let's be honest, with Amazon Prime who wants to pay shipping anymore??? So I did a search and found this gel cleaner and decided to give it a try. So far it's working out well. I like this brand anyway, so I am happy to add more of their products to my lineup.",
                "After much research and considering price and ingredients I decided to order this for my severe perioral dermatitis. I am so happy with this that even though my skin has cleared up, I will continue purchasing this cleanser because it is that good! It never leaves my skin feeling irritated or stripped. The smell is nice and fresh and yes, it does a good job of removing makeup. This cleanser does foam (not like crazy) but it does foam enough to where you feel like \u201cyes I\u2019m clean!\u201d. Highly recommend",
                "My face doesn't get nearly as red with this face wash as it does with others. It doesn't dry out my skin, and definitely helps brighten it up some. I've been using it for weeks now and I think I'll stick to this one. My skin loves it. I'm naturally prone to acne (hormonal and excess oils), have a good amount of redness at any given time & have somewhat sensitive skin. This feels so refreshing, like my skin can breathe finally without stripping off my whole dermal layer. Like I said, my face gets a bit red with this one but then totally balanced out after a minute. It's not totally moisturizing but it doesn't dry me out either."

                "I was just about making my second order and thought it would be nice to write a review.\nI'd never been a 'review person' and that's why even though i bought this product in 2014, i never had the time to review properly until now. I've decided to 'give back' too and not be so selfish thus, make it a habit from now. What better way to start off than with the products i've used and appreciated so much?\n\n*IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING, THIS'S JUST ABOUT MY CONCLUSION TO 1st TIME BUYERS OUT THERE* BASICALLY ;\n\n1. Be sure to workout intensely (esp. your tummy area) to prevent belly fat (cause trust me, it is real) like the plague\n2. If you find the mixture too sweet for your liking you could always dilute it with extra milk, some water, or anything other thing that works for you instead of complaining & whining about it and trying to force it down\n3. Mixing the chocolate & vanilla flavor (with milk) was something i wish i'd figured out sooner. I couldn't have asked for a better taste.\n4. If you're a hard gainer, you can be assured that this product WILL do something for you (if you take it properly and workout well it would do a whole lot more than that).\nI would know because i'm a serious hard gainer myself and wouldn't even say i 'used it that properly' at all but, in the end i did see noticeable gains and got weight gain compliments for the first time in all my life.\nI'm sure if you eat well, train really hard, and take this alongside you'd be just more than fine!\n5. It has some kind of \"very sweet after-taste\" though, which lasts for some time. (could be up to 12hrs or more) even if you keep eating things in-between or after you take this. What happens is soon as your mouth becomes empty for some time you start to \"feel the taste all over again\". I find it very annoying lol but it's the ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE with this product. I'm ok with any other thing.\n6. Remember to check with your doctor before taking this (if you have any health issues or are on medication or any other supplements).\n\nMy \"testimony\"...(if you're interested) ..\n\nI'd never gained above 5 lbs in such a short time my entire life! I weighed 42kg (92 lbs) before i started my weight gain journey in September 2014 and by the time my serious mass got finished (i visited a hospital in January 2015), checked my weight and it said \"50kg (110lbs)\"\nI'd never gone past 45kg my entire life! Even when i received those \"you've put on weight compliments\" when i was younger, highest i prolly was that time was like 43kg. Because of this i thought there was a mistake in the scales they were using at the hospital two year ago. because at that time i wasn't even taking the serious mass anymore cos it had finished about a month or so ago and i'd stopped working out for about a month or so as well.\nI actually asked the doctor \"um,are.. you really sure it's 50?..didn't it just say that because of my clothes or something?\" (and i'm someone who'd never asked a doctor \"are you sure\" ever in my life!) ... I mean i knew i gained some weight all right while i was still 'on track' with this, but then i knew i'd 'stopped my journey' and wasn't even doing anything anymore so i had definitely lost weight again. That's why i was so surprised! I mean, i had a mirror in my house and all ok?, but i guess because i was constantly looking at myself almost every hour on my gain journey i never actually realised that i had gained!\nIt really was 50kg. I had gained 7kg in 2 months!\ud83d\ude07 (A HARD-GAINER) i want to stress on that again. LOL\n\nI found it really hard to believe so i had to check again during that week with a different scale (for some weird reason i didn't have a scale at home and always had to check outside of the house) lol i really wasn't serious. I checked and got the same measurement to my uttermost surprise. I didn't believe it (still) ... but then after some time i finally got over it & accepted it.\nThat was when it hit me... \"Oh, wow..does this mean i gained even more while i was still on the serious mass?\" ..\"umm.. Huh? \" And then it hit me again... \"this is the first time i've reached 110lbs! ...omg..*my eyes filled with tears* About a year ago that was actually my dream.. to get to 110lbs, and now i'm here! What is this?? How did this even happen?\"\nWell yeah, i WAS extremely confused for a long time. Trust me on that one.\n\nWELL ABOUT WORKOUTs;\n\nI used to do normal 'home exercises' and i never even went to the gym. I had a workout routine, but because i'm severely anaemic it was always extremely difficult for me to workout properly (and the way i REALLY wanted to). So i did basically some 'soft workouts'.\nI didn't have dumbbells at the time, so all i did was basically \"no dumbbell home exercises\" or \"workouts without weight\" more like it.\nThis is why i was so surprised i gained. I realised that if i'd used weights i would've gained even more. I did squats mainly, (different types of squats) and then some donkey kicks and tummy workouts usually. I normally followed \"fitnessblender\" videos on youtube, and then some other fitnessmodels' videos that i found.\n\n*****I bought 2 chocolates 1 vanilla the first time i ordered this product (yes, it was a huge risk i took but this is just how much i believed in this product even before i tried it for myself). I fell in love with it and knew right from the times i researched about it that it was the RIGHT one for me. That was what i needed tbh, and i just knew. I don't know how but oh well, it did pay off in the end so i guess i was just very lucky*****\n\nI never really experienced any form of 'super strength' or felt 'so strong' to do my workouts or anything whenever i used this DURING workout, (and i would not blame it on this because i already had serious low energy problems from my anemic condition), and plus it even says to use it mainly as \"between meals, post-workout & before bed\" in the description (which i did, but also used it as a pre- and during-workout shake as well) so um, because of that i'm not gonna say it didn't do much or help me with my workouts at all. I used it as a pre-and during workout shake mainly because it had creatine and i thought it would help me workout better and easier (But maybe i didn't experience that much of a change in strength/performance because the creatine content is really small? idk) but then i do know it helped me in all sorts of other ways nonetheless. I RECOVERED FROM MY WORKOUTS REALLY FAST and that was an incredible one.\n\nFOR THE TASTES;\n\nTHE CHOCOLATE; wasn't bad at all when mixed with milk.\nI used non-fat milk as they recommend, but then always added some extra cup or so of full cream milk after i got my serving (to dilute it a bit). This was good, i liked better the taste it gave me when i did that, but then the downside was that it increased the amount of the shake and so was always a bit harder to push down quickly.\n\nTHE VANILLA; wasn't bad either. I actually grew more fond of that after sometime when i'd taken the 2 chocolate bags for so long. I liked the taste of that too, but again, it was also way too sweet for my liking when mixed with milk (esp the after-taste). so i'd always add some extra full cream milk/a little water to it to dilute that a bit as well after i'd reached the serving size.\nAfter a while, i started mixing both flavors together and IT WAS GOOD! (i only had a few cups of the chocolate left when i figured this out, so i couldn't do that for long, but then with the few days i did that, i never regretted)!\nI would take one cup of the chocolate flavor, one cup of the vanilla flavor, blend them together, adjust a little with some extra milk, and i'm all good!\n(I always said to myself \"why didn't i think of this earlier?!\" lol)\n\nIn general i never tried any with just water but my brother did once and from the look of things, it's clear they both taste better with milk.\nI never tried mixing either with other solid stuff like peanut butter, oats & the like because i mostly used to blend them with other liquid nutrition shakes (and they always blended well) but i'll try mixing them with dry oats and some other solid stuff this time and see. I'll be sure to leave an update later!\n\nAnyway, to continue my \"testimony\";\n\nIn the beginning i couldn't eat any solid food the rest of the day after i took this in the morning. It filled me up more than a 3 square-meal ever would have so i was always worried i was going to end up relying on that and use that as my 'sole source of nutrition' the entire time.\nGood thing was.. after a while it SERIOUSLY 'OPENED UP MY STOMACH'' and i was able to eat more than i ever could have handled on my own usually. That made me very happy indeed\nI knew it was the work of the serious mass because that was by far the most caloric supplement i was taking.\n\nThe other products i took alongside (more for medical conditions & clinical purposes)were ;\nScandishake vanilla -580 calories\nEnshake chocolate- 600 calories\n(That was probably why i gained so much but i know the serious mass contributed greatly too!)\n\nOh and, ABOUT THE BLOATING THING PEOPLE SAY..\n\nWhat i'm gonna say is it is really true. And i realised it when i experienced it myself. (I already believed and was aware from what i'd read even before i bought the items, but i guess i just didn't think it would be that serious!) lol Yeah, the bloating is SERIOUS as well.\nI had read that you have to workout insanely if you didn't want to end up putting on ONLY FAT so i was already prepared for that. *Only i wasn't as prepared as i thought i was* lol\nBut then to be honest.. with all my 'daily ab workouts' and the like.. i still did have a big tummy while on this mass gainer! lol I probably didn't workout as hard but all i know is i gained weight in the places where i wanted to gain all right, only it came with a lot of belly fat too! I didn't even care at the time though, cause at the time i was far too happy with the gains and knew i could workout later to reduce the belly fat.\nIt was only funny because i'd always been a skinny girl, and i'd never seen my tummy so big (i was actually afraid at some point that it was going to stay that way and it would never go back to the way it was! lol).\n\nI mostly felt 'bloated' and i think it's because i wasn't used to having so much calories in my body. I felt so 'heavy' and 'so pregnant' all the time because i was always so full! lol it was a struggle. But i managed to pull through it. After some time of going off my weight gain journey i got my flat tummy back! :) I know what to do this time if i started my journey again so i doubt that would happen anymore! I will train harder than i did last time so i'm very well prepared i must say. So should you! \ud83d\ude0a\nI would say it was fun though! The whole experience was fun and exciting as i'd never had that much CHALLENGE thrown at... well my body..ever! I was new to working out and all these mass gainers and the like. I gradually grew from there over time.. and now i know so much more than i didn't (two years ago) about mass gainers, workout routines and the like.\n\nI'm still attached to serious mass (yes of course, the love is still there!) and i would keep on buying until i've reached the goal i've always wanted to reach. (which is around 60kg or 132 lbs. I weigh 40kg now, that's about 88lbs yeah, unfortunately.. i lost all that weight in the course of just 1 year and i'm 21 now (which means very much underweight since i'm only 5'3) which is why i'm getting myself more bags of this product)!\n\nFunny thing's, i'm not even in the United States or Canada or the UK. I'm not in a country where i could easily get this product when and if i want. But then i still manage, and do all i can to get it every time (If i told you how much trouble i go through and how much money it costs me every time, you would marvel!)\nThe number of things i could buy with the amount i spend just trying to get 2 bags of serious mass down to where i am... it's ridiculous but oh well, when something's worth it you're never really bothered so this should tell you just how much useful this product is!\nThose of you who can just order it and get it the next day or two (and at this price with no other extra costs), be very lucky and make good use of it.\n\n(I'm not getting anything for this review just so you know, i do not know the company or haven't had any agreements to do this with whatsoever. I took time & wrote this review wholeheartedly just so future buyers would know what a great product this is just in case they were having any doubts) \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFor hard gainers... i'll DEFINITELY recommend!",
                "I gained 15-20 pounds in a month. No signs of slowing down. I am male, 5\u201910\u201d and have floated around 160-165 pounds for years because of a fast metabolism and an inconsistent appetite.\n\nThat weight gain came after using about one bag of protein powder + regular meals. I use one serving (2 scoops) per day (with a few missed days bc\u2026life), but I use very scant scoops (helps it lasts longer). I *highly* recommend using a blender to mix this thoroughly. I use my simple Nutri Ninja Pro. When you\u2019re done blending, pour the shake in a cup and clean the blender immediately every time to make your life easier tomorrow. It\u2019s much tastier blended with ice (about 1/2 cup) to dissipate the sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s also more refreshing with little pockets of cold. I use whole milk instead of water, about 3/4 cup. Blend in more milk until the consistency is acceptable to you, like a milkshake rather than like pudding (eck).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a heavy drink and sometimes makes it difficult to eat other food, so I usually try to drink just 1/2 in the morning, stick the rest in the fridge, and drink 1/2 at night.\n\n~~\n\nI\u2019m noticing full body gains, but most prominently in my legs (thighs and glutes) and arms. It seems to be mostly muscle. I highly recommend adopting a regular exercise routine, including weights, for the best results with this. I think working out helps ensure your gains are in line with the physique you want, if you have physique goals.\n\nI started doing StrongLifts 5x5, which only requires 3 workouts per week. Takes about 45 minutes and it\u2019s 3 basic compound movements/lifts per workout, done every other day. I swim laps on 3 of my \u201coff\u201d days with one completely off day. So, I\u2019m always getting a full body workout, although SL 5x5 has you squat in every workout, and that really develops the lower body \u2013 and, conveniently, working your lower body enhances the rest of your body\u2019s growth.\n\nDo whatever you want, but it\u2019s nice to keep it simple and consistent.\n\n~~\n\nThat\u2019s about it. Drink plenty of water (it can dehydrate you in the beginning) and get enough sleep. This stuff works well.",
                "*THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF YOU CAN DRINK THIS AND GET RESULTS WITHOUT WORKING OUT...... READ AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE!!*\n\nI was always at the 150-160lbs range my entire life and looked skinny even though my height/weight BMI said I was basically in the perfect range. I tried eating more and drinking more of these, went through about 5-6 bags but wasn't religiously taking in as much calories as I could to try to gain some mass/fat/weight...\n\nAs the title says, this is for whoever might be NOT working out and looking to buy this.\nTwo months ago I went thru some crazy epiphany evolving ego death and glimpses into the future of where my soul would go if I kept doing the negative stuff I was doing, etc of which I'll spare you the details.\n\nI weighed myself and I was exactly at 162lbs.\nI can't cook for #$$% so I asked my mom to make some homemade food for me that I could keep in the fridge/freezer so I could eat 3 \"real\" meals a day and not just fast food. Being the best mom in the world that she is, she made me 3 meals a day and I would just go to her house to eat most of the time to eat with the family. After every meal, I would drink a full serving of the Serious Mass. I used whole milk, 2 heaping scoops, 3 big spoonfuls of peanut butter, huge drizzle of honey, and a drizzle of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I didn't notice much difference until about a month of doing this. I tried wearing a few shirts that had fit me loose, but now they were almost stuck to my body (but I still didn't have a FAT belly). I did notice overall \"gains\" in mass in my upper chest/shoulders and especially my upper back. Remember, I NEVER ONCE WORKED OUT OR EXERCISED DURING ALL OF THIS.\n\nFast forward to the end of the 2nd month and now I have a visible FAT BELLY THAT I CAN'T EVEN SUCK IN - WHEN I DO SO, I CAN STILL SEE THE FAT AREAS.... Before all this, my stomach was flat and had NO FAT, when I sucked in my belly it would slightly go IN..... NOT ANYMORE.....\nI'M TYPING THIS WITHOUT A SHIRT ON, SITTING AT MY COMPUTER, AND I SEE 3 LAYERS OF FAT ROLLS DESCENDING DOWN TO THE LARGEST ROLL THAT STOPS RIGHT ABOVE MY WAIST LINE. I NOW EVEN HAVE SOMEWHAT OF \"LOVE HANDLES\". I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MAKE FACES WITH IT. I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MOVE THE ROLLS AND MY ENTIRE BODY MOVES WITH IT. WHEN I WEAR A PLAIN TEE SHIRT, MY STOMACH STICKS OUT AND IS VISIBILE (NOT THE ENTIRE STOMACH THANK GOD, BUT THE MIDDLE SECTION JUST KIND OF POKES OUT AND THE SHIRT RESTS ON IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN). I TRY TO INHALE AND SUCK MY BELLY IN AS HARD AS I CAN AND IT ONLY WORKS FOR A MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE TO EXHALE AND MY BELLY JUST PLOPS RIGHT BACK OUT.\n\nFOR 29 YEARS, I'VE NEVER GONE ABOVE 170lbs - I WAS ALWAYS 150-160LBS WITH LEAN MUSCLE.\nI AM NOW CONSIDERED \"OVERWEIGHT\" ON THE BMI INDEX - 30 IS \"OBESE\", MY CURRENT NUMBER IS 29.1 !!!!!!!!!!!!! I AM 5' 11\" AND 210 POUNDS.......................\n\nSO IF YOU ARE SKINNY, HAVE A FAST METABOLISM, AND CAN'T SEEM TO GAIN ANY WEIGHT -\nYES, THIS STUFF WILL DO EXACTLY WHAT IT SAYS. MIND YOU, LIKE I SAID - I DID NOT WORK OUT AT ALL.... WHICH IS WHY I GAINED SOME OVERALL MASS IN MY SHOULDERS/BACK BUT THE MOST MASS IS THE FAT BELLY I NOW HAVE.\n\nI advise you to NOT drink 3 full servings a day along with 3 meals if you aren't working out or exercising.\nI mean I knew I'd gain SOME fat, but 50 POUNDS in 2 MONTHS, AND 90% TO MY BELLY!!!\nMy fault, I know... but just KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!!! UNLESS YOU WANNA BE MAKING FACES WITH YOUR FAT BELLY ROLLS!",
                "Rather than using this product for weight gain, it's been helping me with weight management. I'm typically too busy at work to eat properly, so I had been cramming all of my calories in at the end of the day which was causing my metabolism to yo-yo. I was eating so few calories during the day my body was freaking out and hoarding all the fat and going into starvation mode. I now have one to one and a half servings of this product during the day and it has completely stabilized my metabolism and weight. I have tried MANY other products for this purpose from expensive meal replacement shakes (Huel and Quest) to protein powders of all kinds and they have all tasted nasty, caused upset stomachs and diarrhea, or both. I am happy to say this product has never upset my stomach or caused digestive problems, and it tastes so good (chocolate peanut butter flavor) that I look forward to drinking it each day. I only use cold water to mix it since I don't have to mask the taste, but it is more shake-like if you blend it with milk and ice. Great product!",
                "this product has helped me tremendously. I have an insanely fast metabolism so gaining weight has always been difficult for me. in about a month or two I gained close to ten pounds. starting at 115. two scoops is one serving size but I fully recommend using one scoop (half a serving). half servings are like regular shakes and are much easier to drink then the intended full two scoop serving. a full serving of any mass gainer is extremely thick and almost like sludge. the flavor on this powder is good and only tastes chalky if you don\u2019t properly blend. I also add alot of ingredients like almond milk, fruits, steel cut oats, peanut butter concentrate and sometimes bananas. highly recommend this one because it\u2019s the most bang for your buck. only downside are the flavor options.",
                "This works great, I'm 6'1\" was always 150 - 170 since high school and I'm 35 now. The last 2 years I finally made it to 200 and 215 at one point. I have a fast metabolism and I only use it to maintain my weight now, originally used it twice a day, once in the morning, and before bed I used two Cups of milk 2 servings of peanut butter and just one big heaping scoop. You will gain weight doing that, even if you're just having one large actual meal a day, but now I just make a shake in the morning, However I just found out from my girlfriend that they sell one of these for $24 at Walmart so don't buy it on here it has gone up a few dollars every couple months for the last 2 years this used to be $30 on Amazon, don't get suckered in with their inflation prices this is price gouging like when people were selling rolls of toilet paper for $20 a roll during the plandemic.",
                "I've used this product for around 2 years now. First year I had Invisalign and used this as a big breakfast meal replacement to skip lunch. Second year used this for calories and building muscle.\n\nAt the beginning I had some negative side affects as others have mentioned, but my body soon got used to it after daily intake. I only recently saw the comments about Maltodextrin, which explains a lot. I will finish the last of my bag, but I will not be buying anymore of this.\n\nThis can help gain weight, but the main factor in changing your body is actually excercising. Eat healthy instead of this, your body will thank you.\n\nFlavor reference:\n-Powder: I used 2 scoops (about 15oz). Not heaped as it recommends, but about 4/5 a scoop to prevent spilling when taken out of the bag.\n-Liquid: I used whole milk (about 20oz. If using less than it becomes too thick and grainy). It makes it more smooth and creamy. Water will work if needed, but I do not recommend it. Lower fat percentages of milk are alright, though the lower it gets the more it leads to my water comment. Almond milk makes it thicker, adds its flavor to it and yet also somehow makes it watery.\n-Blender: Ninja QB1004 48oz blender. Mix for few seconds, do something for few minutes, mix for few seconds again. Ensures complete incorporation.\n-Eating: 35oz is too big, so I pour it into a bowl. Gulp down as much as you can in one go to reduce size while still hungry, then drink rest normally over some minutes.\n\nFlavors in order of preference:\n-Vanilla = 4/5; Feeling: light; Taste: a flavor you could convice yourself is vanilla-like.\n-Banana = 4/5; Feeling: light; Taste: faint banana flavor, similar to artificial flavor of laffy taffy or a popsicle.\n-Chocolate = 4/5; Feeling: medium; Taste: a thick version of chocolate milk.\n-Chocolate Peanut Butter = 3/5; Feeling: heavy; Taste: kind of cream-like taste with a unique flavor that you could convince yourself is peanut butter (Hard to describe).\n-Strawberry = 1/5; Feeling: light; Taste: cheap Fruity Pebbles aftertaste with a tinge of chemical flavor (not as horrible as other reviews say, but not really worth trying)",
                "Trying to gain weight, and this certainly helps. Some milk and a scoop of this in my MagicBullit mixer cup - slap on the lid and ready for the ride into work knowing I have something good going on that day.\nThe flavor is awesome. So glad my daughter found this for me on Amazon",
                "I usually run around 180 lbs. I recently had spine surgery. I got down to 146. After about 25 days, I got back up to 177! I also watched healthy and lift weights. But this was a huge help! Highly recommend to anyone looking to add some lbs.",
                "Huge bag and huge scoop. It tastes okay in smoothies but not just mixed with water I have to chug it like that. I always brush my teeth right after because it makes them feel weird. It definitely makes you gain weight if you do it the right way.",
                "This is my first rodeo with weight gainers. I read the reviews and chose this one. I like the flavor and it mixed well with juice or milk. I don't use a full scoop, it seems like 2 much. I use the first line since I'm just starting with it. My issue is that it gives me bad stomach aches and diarrhea. I know that it's the powder because I wasted some on the floor. My puppy locked it up while I was getting the mop. When I took him out, his poo was really loose, like mine was (sorry). I'm going to keep using it to try to get used to it. If it becomes too much for me, I will discontinue using it and update.",

                "Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Protein Powder offers 50 grams of protein & 1,250 calories per serving- which is substantial. As you\u2019ll see from my pictures it also carries a ton of vitamins & minerals one should have on a daily basis. The ingredient quality is wonderful. Now these pictures are not shown on the Amazon description page for this product. What also isn\u2019t shown is the fact this 6 pound jug I purchased for my teenage Son comes with ONLY 8 SERVINGS PER CONTAINER. 2 heaping scoops blended with 24 ounces of fluid to your liking gets what shows in my blender. It\u2019s a drinkable amount with no problem. The chocolate flavor he likes. I\u2019ve found it\u2019s best to mix with milk as water tasted too bland. My issue is I felt I was misled in purchasing this 6 pound tub & not realizing there would be only 8 servings I\u2019d get out of it. Since no pictures or written description mentions this, the buyer has no idea. The jug is enormous but is literally 1/2 full. I do feel there is 6 pounds in here but why waste so much plastic? At $45 a jug I\u2019m undecided on purchasing this again. He just began taking it. After 3 uses he\u2019s gained 4 pounds with lifting twice. Bottom line a quality product but an expensive one. I hope my information helps in your decision to purchase the jug or not.",
                "I've been meaning to post this for months...\nIf you or someone you know wishes to gain weight this is the product. I've personally used it after an extreme lost weight ( I am perfectly fine now-it was not health related moreso mental health related). Some people emotionally eat when they're having difficult times well, I am the type where I will not eat...literally. After some time, trying to eat foods made me gag, so I said I'll drink my meals. I got strawberry (not a chocolate fan). You must blend it and it's best with oat milk or Almond as it may make you a bit gassy on its own so adding dairy can increase that \ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude33, unless you need the fat.",

Like do you remember in the movie Grumpy Old Men when Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau his dead fish in each other\u2019s cars?\n\nThis was my reality a few weeks ago. Picture the family minivan. Naturally in this situation you start to wonder what the Hell kind of food the kids dropped that rolled under a seat and started to rot. You give the car an extended once over, an amateur\u2019s attempt at detailing including pulling out and scrubbing all the floor mats. It wouldn\u2019t be outrageous for the smell to have been dog poop on someone\u2019s shoe so you scrub the floors just in case.\n\nBut still when you turn on the air blowers the smell of pure disgust blasts through the vents and saturates your amazing cleaning job (and your family).\n\nWhen your hubby checks the air filters, he discovers that the family minivan has been invaded by another family. It\u2019s like a Lifetime movie where there\u2019s someone else living in the attic and terrorizing everyone and making you think you\u2019re crazy.\n\nOnly this time that family is a family of mice. And they didn\u2019t make it. And your car\u2019s smell accurately and intensely reflects these events.\n\nEven after removing the second family from the situation, their stench lingered. It takes some time to rid a family minivan of such a smell, but we decided we didn\u2019t need to suffer through the process. And that\u2019s where this car air freshener came in.\n\nBayside Breeze. Halle-FREAKING-lujah, what an amazing scent. I never would have imagined I\u2019d be in this situation, and that a little scented tree shaped savior wrapped in plastic could bring our traumatized nostrils so much pure joy. You can even slowly freshen over time by pulling a little more tree out of the package\u2014which is a great feature for making the most of one air freshener and increasing its longevity. And that\u2019s what we will do with the second one in the package. But in our case, we went all in and took the glorious tree fully out of the package. You just don\u2019t mess around with the lingering scent of the dead mouse family that snuck under your car and made its home in your air filter. You replace the filter and get yourself some of these.",

                "We live in our camper full time. We've never had this particular issue with the black tank before but this hose worked great to fix it. The master bedroom is next to the bathroom and it started to smell in the bedroom each time we flushed. Did some research for a solution as the pods just weren't cutting it. (We also have a sewer connector that has a water hose hookup for better cleaning after we empty the black tank that we've been using for quite a while.) I came across this hose attachment and my husband used it and no more smell!! Whether you are living in your RV or just camping, I highly suggest getting this hose attachment for a better cleaned black tank.",
                "Our RV black tank had an odor that we just couldn\u2019t seem to get rid of no matter how much chemical that we put in the toilet. After a weekend out with the RV we went to the dump station and emptied both tanks. I then used this tank sprayer and could not believe how much more yuk came out of the tank. There was quite a bit of toilet paper I guess stuck to the sides of the tank and the sensors. Now no more smell. Well worth the money. Highly recommended!",
                "We purchased a used camper that was in great shape. Upon our first camping trip with it we noticed every time we flushed the toilet the smell was awful!! Tried everything from treatments to leave in products. Nothing worked. Tried flushing with hose etc. a camper told us to try this. He had same issue. It was build up in tank. Ordered this and used it for about 20 minutes in tank. Open black water valve let it run. Then close it let it run open it again. Do this often. Beware!!! Make sure you have someone outside opening and closing it. The tank will fill up fast and over flow. You need to shut water off to toilet for the cleaning wand is put down in tank. It forces water out at end spinning. Lesson learned. Do not take out of tank without shutting water off on the unit!!! Works great!!!! No more smell.",
                "This wand worked great. Have tried the solid wand but my black tank would still show 3/4 or full when only 1/4 full. This flexible wand went down into the tank and cleaned all the sensors and my ready after dump is EMPTY, and that is great.\nWorth every penny!",
                "We ordered this because I bought the wrong toilet paper and clogged the toilet, oops. It cleared the problem right up and was super easy and not as messy as i thought it would be.\n\nDefinitely get yourself a good pair of gloves to go with it!!",
                "We'd been having some issues with the level indicators on our 5th-wheel's black tank. We have a 45\u00b0 elbow not far below the toilet, so there's no \"straight shot\" between the bathroom and the tank. This little CAMCO device worked like a charm in snaking through the elbow and it cleaned the tank thoroughly without any issues. It was simple to use and built to high standards. We'll continue to use this on a proactive basis a few times a season just to keep things well-cleaned. Recommended!!",

                "This thing works great, but buy the toilet gaurd that they sell for under 10.00. First try of cleaning I was covered in sewage. I ended up having to use handful of paper towels to block the spray back.",

Before having the wand the toilet tank would smell aweful until deodorant tabs were put in and started working.

                "I like that it has a shut off valve on it.",
                "Iv'e used this product since 2011, with no problems. no leaks, after first use, the vibration noises did bother me was pretty loud. I modified the entire thing. my pipe goes straight down, I measured from the bottom of the tank to the top of the toilet valve, then from the top of valve to the bottom of the pipe 17\". the got a 2\" PVC pipe which fit exactly through the opening in toilet so to not disturb the gasket around valve I don't use the shut off valve on the stick, I connected a regular hose nozzle to the stick, just turn it on and use the lock on thing on nozzle, after centering the stick inside the PVC as best I could, I drilled and tapped 1/4x20 holes saced evenly all the way up the PVC 3 at each interval and used stainless s thumb screws, counting the turns to get it centered at each cotact poing just snug against the stick. make sure to use hose washers wherever the hose screws in I use grease on all hose washers to keep them soft grease both sides of washers. once all is centered and screwed snug with tuimb screws I drilled 1/4' holes along the stick and filled with spray foam insulation and trimmed off any excess out the top and bottom at the brass swivel . then paced 3 1/4x20 thumb screws exactly 18 inches from bottom of the swivel leaving the thumb part out from the PVC to keep it from falling to the bottom of the tank.\n\nIv'e read the reviews about not enough pressure, the trick to more pressure, is to pass as much water as possible through the smallest amount of area as possible. I relaced the airater in the bathroom sink with an airater with a hose connector on it, turn off the hot water heater so can use all the water coming in and not trying to heat the water passing through, I even put a shut off valve on water going into toilet so that water is going through the stick and not just running into the toilet serving no purpose other than filling the tank. I also bought a high pressure washer hose which looks more like a 3/8' hose rater than the standard 1/2' or 5/8'= smaller hose=more pressure, yes my swivel did stop spinning one time, but at the speed that thing turns it's going to get hot the water passes through it not around it keeping it cool it needs lubrication I plugged the two holes in the swivel with fresh bread, opened the shut off valve on the stick, used a funnel abd poured it full if 5-30 oil, hooked up the regulat hose nozzle, turn the ater on full blast and locked it, the bread will hold the oil in until the water is allowed to go through.once the water hose is hooked up open the shut off valve on yellow stick, the water will push the oil, pushing the bread out the oil will lubricate the swivel. I've probably used mine 100 times over the years the swivel has never stopped again.I leave the entire thing together in the storage unfer the camper. you'll need a male to male hose adapter to hookthe washer hose to the hose nozzle found at any hardware store for a couple bucks. when you need to use it, simply turn off hot water heater, put the unit into te toilet, screw the one end of washer hose onto the sink and turn bot sides of faucet on, in two minutes or less you're cleaning your tank without pulling any dirty hoses in throughout trailer!\n\nI'd rated this a 5 if Camco could design the swivel to move up and down like a drive through car wash, apparently there is something stuck on my 1/3 mark? when i clean it it says empty yetwhen I just empty the tank it always reads 1/3 on my sensors panel. I suspect the water is just running over the sensor enough to make it say empty but not blasting whatever it is off? I'm now using the detegent dispensor from my power wsher with dish detergent hopefully, after a few uses it wll clean tha spot? will revise this review if it does? the spray foam does make it a bit heavier but it sure made it simple to use",
                "I had a lingering odor after emptying the black tank on my camper. My camper comes with a sprayer bu reallly doesn\u2019t do a very good job. I have been extremely happy with this purchase and would recommend it to everyone",

                "This was a fun little experiment that my kids and I really enjoyed! I had been wanting to grow some crystals with the kids, so when I saw this fun Christmas tree, I jumped right on it! It was a fun activity especially over Christmas Break when we were home all day to watch the crystals grow. They really did come on quickly in the 6 hours as promised. Based on previous reviews and knowing the crystals would be delicate, we put on the star and garland at the beginning when we added the liquid. Definitely the way to go! We sprinkled on the sparkles when it was all done. I do agree that I wish a little more explanation was given on how and why the crystals formed, and what kind of crystals they were. Other than that, a lot of fun for my 7, 5, and 2 year old (and and their geeky parents, too!)",

Everyone had a good time watching the girls race to open the presents. I almost feel like that took an extra close look at what each gift was after working so hard to get to it.

I will never do business with them again or any other company that does not offer free shipping. I think a lot of companies are discounting thier prices and then really sticking it to you on shipping and handling. Unless it qualifies for Amazon's free shipping, I'm not buying!",

The crystal completely covers it and you won't see it anyways, and the tree is too fragile to apply anything other than glitter after it grows. The only problem I had was that my son loved it so much that after a week, when it started to dry out and fall apart and make a mess, and I had to throw it out, my son cried his eyes out to see it go!! By the way, it does say on the package that it is only supposed to last a couple of days, so it far outlasted its life expectancy.",
                "Fun and educational...if you know how it works. =)\nIt did exactly what it said it would. It lasted a couple of days longer than it said it would so that's a plus.\nMy only complaint is that if you bump it or move it the \"tree\" falls apart, crumbles everywhere, So maybe if the little dish was a little bigger it wouldn't be so bad. I would put it on a piece of construction paper or something of the like next time.",
                "Excellent choice for a magic crystal kit. Quite a bit larger than the other trees (not Christmas themed) we have tried in the past. The package claims it will only last a couple day, but we had ours up about two months. The trick is to put it somewhere that it will not be bumped or shaken. Place it there before you grow it, as the crystals are very fragile and will break easily when moved. It is great fun for children to watch how fast these crystals grow and I highly recommend it for a stocking stuffer.",
                "This Christmas tree is so much fun! It really does grow over the course of a single day (though it will be a little bigger the next morning). If you leave it alone it will last for as long as you want to keep it around. The decorations that come with it are incredibly cute (little string of red beads, glitter, and a star). I've given it as a gift to quite a few friends who were otherwise Christmas tree-less at the holidays. It probably isn't great for little kids - it's pretty delicate once the crystals have grown. I think they're non-toxic, though.",
                "I sent this as a gift to a friend who wasn't going to have a Christmas, and surely not a tree. I wanted some kind of fun for them so I sent this. She said the instructions said to put the bead decorations on first and then let it grow which proved to be a bit tricky. It grew overnight making the surprise the next morning even more fun. She said it didn't come out just like this picture but close enough to be a tree and she was thrilled with the surprise.",
                "I bought one of these when I was in Urban Outfitters. I thought it would be fun to have on my desk at work. It was horrible. It didn't absorb the water all the way and fell apart instantly. Then I found this one on here and figured why not give it another try. Well, the one I ordered was great! I gave one to my niece and nephew to keep in their bedroom and I think its still there right now. Its just something small and cute to have for the holidays. I bought another one for my desk at worked and everyone loved it.",
                "We've had other little trees and love watching them grow. Thought I'd try this 6 inch Christmas tree and loved it, too. The decorations were cute. It only took a few hours to start, was complete within 30 hours.\nIf you've never done one of these before here's a tip - Don't touch or move the branches or the crystals will fall off."

In 1989, Natracare was developed as a direct response to health and environmental concerns about dioxin pollution by chlorine bleaching, the use of rayon in tampons, and the extensive use of pesticides on conventionally grown cotton. For over 15 years, Natracare has been trusted by women who see the good sense in making a natural choice in tampons, pads, panty liners and feminine wipes for their monthly cycle. It makes sense to choose a tampon that is made from only certified organic cotton to avoid unnecessary exposure to chemical residuals and synthetics. Natracare Organic cotton tampons and chemical free pads are high quality products made from only pure and natural materials that are not chlorine bleached and are free of rayon, plastics and synthetic materials. Made in Germany.",

                "They don\u2019t have any applicators included like their other products - tampons are just individually wrapped in plastic instead of recycled paper packaging.",
                "I\u2019m a relatively health conscious individual and have been gradually making changes into a healthier lifestyle.\nI kind of always knew how awful regular tampons were for you (I mean it\u2019s terrible that us ladies have been sticking bleach and pesticide infested cotton up our lady parts for YEARS. I mean, no wonder so many woman have ovarian cancer!), but was always pushing off making the switch because of the price of these things! I mean, I can get 5 cancer sticks (aka regular tampons) at Cosco for the price of one of these. And that certainly adds up over time! But then again, so does the cost of harming the body with all those chemicals. Urggg.\n\nSo I finally decided that well-being was vastly more important than a few extra bucks each month and thus, made the switch these little bullet looking things, which I call 22\u2019s. Check out the pics and tell me it doesn\u2019t look like the bullet for a 22! I got the kind without the applicator, because it\u2019s less waste for the environment and (ok I admit it) mostly because it was cheaper.\n\nI was actually kind of freaking out about the no applicator thing (I mean how gross that I have to \u2026well, I\u2019ll leave out the details). Well, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it took a few times for me to get used to it, but again, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, I\u2019ve found that an AWESOME perk about the no applicator is that it\u2019s SO small and compact that it takes up virtually no room. Stick one or 2 in my pocket on a night out and I\u2019m good to go!\n\nLast thing to make note of... Again, it might be TMI but heck, what did you expect to get from a tampon review?! So before I had reformed my ways and was still buying cancer sticks, it would sometimes get itchy up there in lady world and would just feel \u2026hard to describe\u2026itchy/uncomfortable/not clean. Since I\u2019ve switched, that never happens anymore! Yay! I\u2019m pretty sure it was my ladyhood revolting at me in the presence of such unclean cancer sticks.\n\nI was NOT paid to do this review or given any free stuff. I did it because I\u2019m hoping that more ladies will make the switch. I know it\u2019s more expensive but your well-being is vastly more important than a few dollars. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert ;)\nAnyways, hope you enjoyed the review and that this helped. Please leave comments or questions if you have any and I\u2019d be SUPER appreciative if you\u2019d be so kind as to rate my review :D\n\nP.S. A few people commented about this being so hard to unwrap. They must have updated the product because it now has an easy peel flap in the middle. I took a pic so you can see what I mean.\nXoxo",
                "Organic cotton tampons are more expensive than rayon, but they're made with fewer chemicals and the fibers cause less trauma to the vaginal walls so I use them religiously. This one is a great product, easy to use and transport, and since I bought a case I won't need to buy tampons for over a year (FYI, I do the same with the Natracare breathable panty liners -- the only ones that don't leave me with a yeast infection since standard liners with plastic build up moisture).\n\nThe case is pretty compact, so storage isn't a problem and I get to enjoy both savings and convenience of not buying tampons monthly. Keep in mind these do not have an applicator, but I prefer this because they're more discreet (I can hide one in the palm of my hand or pants pocket) and also create less waste than the applicator versions.",
                "I love these. They are hard to find in stores, and more expensive there to boot.",
                "Love these things. Buying by the case, I can keep enough tampons everywhere and not worry about running out every time I get my period. And theyre organic so thats important to me. Maybe they could be more comfortable but they are perfect for me in every other way and periods just arent comfortable in general so the pros outweigh the cons",
                "I used O.B. before. Then suddenly that brand became unavailable EVERYWHERE. I hate plastic and applicators and all the waste. I hate the tampons that grow longer instead of wide.....Blah\n\nThese are comparable to O.B.. I did have a little less cramping...but not much. They are a bit more solid....almost to hard to absorb at first...I found that if I loosened it a bit by sticking my finger in the string end and scrunching it a bit, it made it a bit softer and more absorbent right away.\n\nHave switched to a cup now, but still carry these around for emergencies. Very nice product.",

                "These tampons are really good. It takes a little getting used to not having an applicator, but it's not a big deal.\nMy mind is at ease knowing the fibers are organically grown and do not contain harmful chemicals.\nThey can be a bit tricky to open at times, but mostly they are excellent. I also love the fact that buying them in a large quantity means I have plenty on hand and do not have to reorder frequently. Buying the case is definitely worth the investment and saves money.",
                "I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice.",
                "I used to be a die-hard OB user or nothing. These tampons changed my mind. They work better and make me feel better using an organic product instead of non-organic that is treated with pesticides. Would recommend!",

The ingredients in Super Seed were specifically chosen for their exceptional ability to support and maintain optimal bowel health and function. Many other fiber supplements rely on insoluble fiber alone and provide very little in the way of nutrition.

I tried mixing it with water on day 1, and it was a gloopy mass. Now I mix it with applesauce, mix in some water, and eat it quickly before the flax seed thickens it too much. It is not enjoyable to eat, but it does work well.",

                "This stuff works pretty good! Don't start with a whole scoop! Start with a quarter scoop. Work you're way up. I eat it on buttered Graham crackers. If you put it in liquid it turns to sludge. Oddly it has a slight cinnamon taste to it.",

                "i like the taste of this, its easy to mix and use.",
                "I really enjoy this stuff and want to take a minute to share my experiences using this as a fiber supplement in case it's helpful to other people. I go to the gym in the mornings and also take medication that works best on an empty stomach. Working off of an empty stomach after hitting the gym can be difficult, so I have added this to my daily routine each morning. This stuff isn't for everyone, especially not for people who have issues with certain textures. It definitely clumps up a lot if you allow it to do so and there is nothing worse than getting a big clump of this stuff when trying to pound it down.\n\nTo avoid clumping I use a 32 ounce Nalgene with a lid and add about two inches of water. Then I take a full scoop of the powder and shake about a third of it into the container. If I see a big clump on the scoop while doing this, I break it up with my finger before pouring it in. After adding a third of the scoop I put the lid on the container and shake it well. Then I add another inch or so of water and half of the remaining scoop and repeat with adding water and shake. Do this one more time to finish the scoop of powder and fill the container to the top and shake vigorously. This is the only way I've found to avoid clumping. Adding one whole scoop at once always results in clumping. The clumps float to the top and can be broken apart with a fork but why deal with that when you can just avoid it all together. Please be aware that this supplement has actual chia seeds and various other seeds/sprouts in it that do not dissolve. This won't go away no matter how much you shake!\n\nThis process may seem like a pain but it only takes a minute and makes it a lot easier to guzzle it down. I know 32 ounces of water may seem like a lot for some people but you just have to get used to chugging it down. Don't let it sit too long because the chia seeds start absorbing water and become a little gelatinous. You should be drinking plenty of water if you want this stuff to work efficiently so this is a good way to get some of your water requirements (or goals) for the day out of the way. I try to get it all down within 10 minutes of making it. Then I'm set for the day!\n\nNot only does this do the job in the gut department, it also helps me feel full and gives me a boost of energy that gets me through until lunch time when I can eat something with some substance to it. It also feel like doing this allows my meds to kick in better. I take them about two hours before the fiber drink.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that this stuff doesn't work for them and my boyfriend tried it for a few months and also said that it didn't help him in the bathroom department, but that's because he wasn't drinking enough water throughout the day. He preferred to drink his mixed with a bit of water in a coffee mug and then didn't drink much water throughout the day. Using a small amount of water makes it incredibly sludgy and gross so I have no idea how he even stomached it. I'm not saying you have to drink a ton of water the second you take it if you prefer to use less, but if you do plan on using it be sure to drink lots of water consistently, even on days you aren't using it.",
                "hope it works.",
                "This is a great amount for the price. So a really good deal. There is no flavor so I put it in my oatmeal or smoothie in the mornings. It has worked great for me also. It does what I need it to.",

                "I blend a couple tablespoons of this with a little milk. It's healthy probiotic goodness with a lot of fiber and a fair amount of protein. I drink it right away after I blend it, otherwise after a few seconds it starts getting super think. Best to follow it with some water to aid digestion.",
                "I did not enjoy the flavor of this product. It's a bit fruity and I personally really taste the cinnamon. Just doesn't work for me.",
                "This is a good fiber but it's too messy and to dense. I found if i waited too long to drink it the mixture would clump",
                "Pleasant taste, but if you're looking for something that completely dissolves in liquid, look elsewhere.",
                "I'm trying to listen to my Dr. for a change and I decided to add more fiber to my diet. I wanted to add a supplement and I tried the orange flavored stuff. It was OK, but I wanted something that tasted more natural than like clumpy Tang with artificial sweetener.\n\nI purchased Garden of Life Super Seed based on the ingredients and good reviews and I am very happy with it. Not only am I getting fiber, I'm getting protein, Omega 3 and all the other good stuff it has. I was a little concerned because it had more calories and I'm overweight, but it is actually helping me lose weight by filling me up.\n\nI've also used it as a meal by mixing it with skim milk and eating it with 7-grain toast with marmalade or a couple of scrambled eggs. I love it mixed with milk. It goes down like a bran muffin in a drink. I also sometimes drink a glass with water 15 minutes before dinner and I noticed I'm able to control my portions much better.\n\nAnother reviewer said it is clumpy, and it is, especially if you wait. That is because fiber absorbs water so as time goes on it gets a little thick. The orange stuff works the same way, so either way you have to drink it quickly or maybe water it down a little and mix it up again (or just drink the thick remainder). OK, it doesn't taste like chocolate cake, but it isn't supposed to. I think this stuff tastes great, especially with milk.\n\nI find that out of the other high fiber foods I've tried (orange stuff, snack bars) this fills me up the best and I feel like my carb cravings have subsided a little.\n\nOver all, I feel my energy level has increased significantly and I have much less mental fog. This isn't due to this particular product per se, but it made it easier for me to increase fiber and lower simple carbs like white flour products and sweets. In addition to this supplement once or twice a day, which is more like a food than a supplement, I'm eating 1 high fiber snack bar a day and trying to eat veggies (I'm allergic to most fruits) at every meal for about 30g of fiber a day. I still eat my favorite bad food (pizza and Chinese food), but I am eating smaller portions-- and not because I'm forcing myself to eat small portions but because I'm full sooner.\n\nI feel great and I'm happy Super Seed is part of my daily diet.",
                "I am NOT a health nut. I am obese and I trying to get my health/weight/stress levels under control. I also do not have any digestive diseases, however I often suffered from significant discomfort from gas, bloating, constipation, and loose stools. These had been a recent onset in the last year or so, previous to that time, I had no GI upset.\n\nI (very reluctantly) decided that my first round of behavior modification would include getting my digestive system under control by trying to regulate my diet, adding a significant amount of fiber and protein. I was very wary of getting a fiber powder because I don't like gritty textures and don't tolerate \"healthy\" tasting items well either. So I tried this in conjunction with a well-reviewed probiotic.\n\nI cannot express to you how impressed I was with this stuff. It mixes fairly easily (only spoon requires), has TONS of really good stuff for you, and doesn't taste terribly bad. However, here are a few tips:\n\nIf you do not like apples AND cinnamon, you will not like this.\nI find it absolutely disgusting when mixed with just water. It tastes to me like I imagine eating water-y mud would taste like (I literally gagged). However, I can use as little as 4 oz of fruit juice and 8 oz of water and be totally happy with the taste.\nIt tastes fake and almost sour if you mix it with apple juice. Orange, mango, and some combination of peach work wonderfully.\nThat being said, I also highly recommend mixing it with 12 oz or more of liquid if your like me and don't like to drink your apple sauce.\nHIGHLY recommend mixing with ice. Even if it sits out in my hand for a couple of minutes, the combination of thick and luke warm makes me gag.\nTends to settle very quickly, so always stir before you drink (especially important if you do water/juice combo instead of all juice. For whatever reason tends to pull just water to top, cause the water/fiber mixture to gag me). Also, tends to get slimier as well when let to sit more than a minute (also something I have trouble with).\nTo get total relief of my GI symptoms, I have to use twice daily.\n\nDouble BONUS POINTS: It works as a superb appetite suppressant. You really will maintain AT LEAST 4 hours without tummy growling hunger.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I can't live without it. Completely made me a believer!",
                "I purchased this because it was advertised as being good for diverticulosis. I like the fact that it takes natural food ingredients to add fiber to your diet. I mix it with a little water and it tastes pretty good. It is sweet and fruity. The important thing to remember with this is that it is powerful and you have to know just the right dose for YOU. If you just jump in and start taking it, it will deliver a nightmare from which you won't want to take it again. LOL The instructions should be rewritten to start with a very small amount, like 1 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon. Then increase it until you achieve the results you're after. How much fiber supplement you need really depends on how much fiber you have already eaten in your meal. Take this supplement along with your meal. I take it no later than 5 p.m. with my dinner and allow it to work its magic overnight. Flax seed is known to cause diarrhea if you're not used to taking it or other strong fiber supplements. You'll be the most happy with this if you learn to graduate yourself upwards until you find the dose that works for you! Trust me on that. Knowledge is power.",
                "This stuff is ok. My biggest complaint is it does not mix well at all.",

                "This is a really great device for keeping cool. It's perfect for two people sitting on chaise lounge chairs. That said, there is an issue. The first time I used it, it worked great. Both nozzles put out a nice mist just the right amount. Second time I used it, one of the nozzles would not work at all. I live in an area that has hard water so I'm not that surprised that this happened, especially when you think about how super tiny the orifice is on the mist nozzles. I did find a way to make the nozzle work again. I took a shot glass and put about 1/3 of a shot of vinegar in the glass. Then I put the nozzle part into the shot glass making sure the vinegar just covered the nozzles and not go above the end cap. I didn't want the vinegar to possibly effect the glue holding on the cap. I left it overnight and the next day it worked just like the first time. I really like this product, I just hope I don't have to do this every time I used it.",
                "I hung this is a tree and the hummingbirds loved it. Plus it\u2019s a nice mister to enjoy on the patio; although it needs to sit on something tall if you want it to be above you as you sit, otherwise it\u2019s at head level.",
                "I finally got to use the outdoor misting system. It only mist on one side the other side sprays out it doesn't mist like the other side does. Not to please with it.\nNot sturdy or strong.\nDoesn't work well!\nIt's easy to use just connect to your hose and turn the hose on.\nGood Luck if you get both misters to work.",
                "In my quest to get a summer tan and not burn up in the process, I purchased this misting system. I'm very pleased with it. I tan on my deck, which tends to get very hot with not much wind. This product arrived in an extremely large box but it was packaged well and arrived undamaged. Setup was very easy and the product performs as it is supposed to. A fine, cool, mist is sprayed from each side of the end and it really does make the area surrounding it cooler. My only complaint is that this thing does not stand up straight. It leans over rather significantly, but it still works!\n\nI would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to stay cool this summer.",
                "One of my friends had one of these and I loved it! She would hook it up while our kids were playing outside on a hot day and she and I would sit comfortably and watch. She would put a box fan behind it when she had parties and everyone on the patio could enjoy a cooling mist. I decided I had to have one, but couldn't find it at any of our local hardware stores. So I came to Amazon, and here it is!\n\nThe downside is that you don't get to pick your color. However, they picked perfectly for me and sent me one that matches the shutters on my house, so I can't really complain! It works very well, is easy to set up, and does just want I want. Putting a box fan behind it ensures that it blows on the right direction instead of relying on the wind. For the price, this item can't be beat!",
                "A friend of mine was looking for a misting system to leave in her backyard for her outdoor pets during the hot days in Los Angeles. We found this Orbit misting system and figured we would give it a try. It works well and undoubtedly mists the area to keep it cooler. It's a good product for the price. Some of the other misters are very expensive and take some time to install; therefore, if you are looking for a quick, inexpensive mister that works, then I would recommend this product. The only down side is the fact that you cannot pick the color of your choosing, you basically get whatever is sent.",
                "Granted, you can't compare this mister to those that are more robust and complicated, but for what it is you can't go wrong. We live in the Sacramento region that has very dry, hot summers. We wanted to get a cheap mister that all we had to do is plug the garden hose into... and the fact that this is a free-standing mister (no installation required) sealed the deal.\n\nRight next to the mister (within about 2-3 feet) it is a wet mist that will leave you feeling a little damp (but cool and comfortable). However, just a little further away you get the cooling without much dampness. The less wind, the better it seems to cool, but a slight breeze doesn't render it useless. It is extremely convenient in that it is reasonably portable.\n\nAn unintended benefit of this mister is that the infant/toddlers that frequented our back yard last summer loved playing with the mister... putting their finger over the nozzle, letting it spray in their faces, etc. It was one of the biggest hits in the back yard for play and for staying cool. It has easily held up to the abuse as well!",
                "It didn\u2019t come with a washer so water would leak everywhere. We used a washer from an old sprinkler that we had and it worked fine. Great for the garden or to cool off a bit on a hot summer day.",
                "We use this mister (there are only two little metal mister nozzles at the top) for keeping the pets cool in the heatwave months. The summers get very hot and dry and our three pets hang around the cool water spray most of the day. The water hose can be turned on with just a little pressure and works all day long to provide a fine mist from the top. The wild birds flock to get drinks of water from the mist that falls on the grass. The mister we received was purple and the base is a bit wobbly so we have to use something to prop it on one end to keep from tipping; but there haven't been any issues yet from it falling over. The wobbling is the only issue keeping this at 4 stars instead of 5.",
                "Living in the South, this mister provides relief when working outside in the yard or just sitting outside reading in the summer. Unlike other misters I have tried, this one doesn't leak when you put it on the hose. Some of these products have a tendency to not be able to thread with your hose sufficiently, thus having leaks and wasting precious water. This provides an even light misting to cool you off without getting soaked. The best part is since the pressure on this is so even, once you turn off your hose, it still provides a mist for about 20-30 minutes later.",
                "Should keep our patio area a little cooler, but I mostly bought it for the hummingbirds I feed. Hopefully they like it. It was missing the washer, which is the first thing the directions ask you to look for. Not hard to fix, just run to the hardware store and pick up some hose washers, but still annoying. That's why I'm taking off one star. Oh, Just a heads up, it comes in a giant box since this product isn't flexible.",
                "Works great and easy to set up. I had a MistyMate 10 which has 6 (plastic) misters you screw into 10' of small tubing, right out of the box half of the misters were broken. Not wanting to deal with buying new misting heads, I decided to give this a try. This thing is awesome ! Easy to set up and it doesn't use a lot of water. The best part is, its so portable to move it around where ever you need it. My wife uses it when she sunbathes and when she is thru with it, I move it over to the dog kennel. We have used it all day, everyday for weeks and only once has one of the \"brass\" nozzles clogged up but, a small peice of wire cleared it. I also bought some Gilmore Metal Hose Coupling Filter Washers which helps to filter out any larger size debris.",
                "I bought this for my daughters birthday party. It was supposed to be over 90 degrees and we had a bounce house so I was afraid the little kids would be over heated. We put this at the end part of the slide so the kids could go through it. Definately was a good idea for us! The kids even fought over it at times and it held up fine (didn't fall apart or anything) . Very light and portable. We put a brick on it to keep it stablized but it wasn't necessary. The kids ended up moving the brick and carrying it all over the place anyways. (or as long as the hose could go) I don't know, long term, the durablity of it since I only used it once so far, but it seems that it would last for a while.",
                "This works pretty well although I have only tested it a couple times because it's not quite warm enough to use it regularly yet. I purchased this to place near my chicken's run to help cool them off during the hot summer months. The only negative thing I will say so far is that it is slightly bent which causes it so fall over- which is annoying. I have to lean it against something to keep it upright. I will update this post in July or August when it's used regularly.",
                "This is EXACTLY what we needed. We didn't want to pay a ton of money for an overhead sprinkler system and then we saw these. We are in hot hot south texas weather and we have chickens that need to stay cool. I bought two of these and set them about 25 foot apart in the chicken yard. They hooked up nicely, did not leak, good material, and the mist is so thin it did not even get the coop wet that was only 5 foot away. There was an obvious drop in temperature right away. My chickens come out during the day now instead of staying hidden until evening when the temperature goes down. They are enjoying their yard again and I am enjoying my hens again. THANK YOU! Could not believe how inexpensive such an effective product could be!",
                "Very surprised by this. It is not going to cover a large space or anything like that but if you are sun bathing or sitting outside this is fantastic. Well worth the money. My toddler thinks it's amusing to put his hand in the mist and get wet. So it is safe around kids. Worst thing they can do is knock it over. It's quite steady by itself due to the design",
                "OG Floridian here, and I seriously can not take the summer heat without this. I just bring it around with me as I garden, or right next to my chair when I'm laying out. Perfection!",
                "The misting stand is overall a nice item, and it cools off the area, but it continuously falls over and has to be picked up. I have 3 others that are made with bendable material and these don't have a problem, so I think it is just the fact that it is not stable on a surface that is not flat. So if you are purchasing for a flat surface and not a uneven lawn then this would be a great purchase. Also the other thing I noticed different about this one compared to the other Orbit Misting Stands I have is that the misting holes were on the top and the others that I have are on the nose.",
                "This summer has been brutally hot on the western shores of Lake Michigan where I slip my sailboat. On a particularly muggy Saturday a few weeks ago I ventured over to a little gathering of my dockmates who happened to have a couple of these set up to cool off the guests. It took me about 5 minutes to log onto Amazon.com and get one of these bad boys on the way! As is often the case, my sailing days since have been spent in the mid-70's so I haven't had a chance to break mine out yet but, given my initial experience with the mister, I'm looking forward to comfortable cocktail hours from here on in! The misting jets are adjustable from a fine vapor up to a pretty good spray. Another one of those million dollar ideas that I wish I had! Fantastic product at a more than reasonable price!",
                "I have owned a mister like this before years ago. I have been looking for one like I had before. It is easy to attach to the water hose and mists well. I bought this two fold. The heat where I live has been almost unbearable. I actually bought two. I use it for my plants which does not seem to get enough water. It is also great when outside and I need a little water misting on myself."

It is amazingly effective, no doubt!\n\nI bought this based on reviews stating that men wear it. I now question the masculinity of those men. This stuff smells like an elderly woman's underwear drawer, magnified by a factor of 10! (don't ask) The sweet stench of baby powder-like perfume encloses me like a pink shroud of estrogen that once was but can never again be.\n\nI fear that the aroma is causing an imbalance in my personal hormonal stockpiles. Testosterone that I had painstakingly manufactured and stored seems to be evaporating into the retirement home-scented atmosphere around me where it is being chemically converted to empathy and a desire to do arts and crafts, to be inhaled by any unfortunate enough to pass nearby.\n\nSailing past age 40, I certainly don't have testosterone to waste, but I am going to give this product a solid opportunity to adapt to my presence... After all, it IS masking the horror of my stench - AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR THAT! But I fear that I shall soon have to scrub it from my armpits with a mixture of bourbon and barbecue sauce and eat roughly 17 lbs of red meat to reset my system.\n\nAgain, this is a HIGHLY effective product. I bet you could sprinkle it in the pit of an outhouse and leave it smelling like a 5-star restaurant (in a nursing home, but you get the point).\n\nSo the jury is still out, but... I think I just felt the twitch of an ovary beginning to grow in my abdomen... NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!",

I have tried basically every available undereye moisturizer at drug stores and just was never particularly thrilled, so I just resigned myself to hoping my circles didn't get much worse over time. However, this cream actually had a noticeable lightening effect on my dark circles (I am definitely not sleeping more these days, so I will give the cream the credit), and completely knocks out the occasional puffiness I have when I wake up. The cream leaves my skin silky but not shiny, it sits under makeup well, and even when I use it liberally morning and night these little jars still last me for months--so the higher price tag works out fine even for my student budget.",
                "Okay, the product packaging says you can use this like a primer. Not so. I use this first, let it sink in, try to avoid my lash line (my eyeliner doesn't stay put if I get it near my lash line) and then use primer over it. I didn't notice any difference in puffiness, but Clinique has reputable products, so just use them the way they work for you. I use this to enhance the anti-aging product I use at night, so I have some protection during the day. I did notice a measurable difference in the number of noticeable wrinkles around my eyes when I pair this with the laser focus cream Clinique has (I use that at night).",
                "Finally! An eye cream that doesn't irritate my skin. This stuff is great. A little goes a long way so the price is not an issue. I've been using the same jar for over a month and it doesn't even look like I've used it at all. It's silky and fragrance free. Love it. So happy I finally found something that doesn't make my eyes puffy and scaly like everything else I've tried."

Amazon is an authorized online retailer for PCA, however, I would honestly question whether Amazon is re-selling returned products.

I could no longer use retinol products either. I didnt know what to use and my doctor as well as esthetician recommended this line. It was well worth it. That glowing, pregnant look does NOT occur naturally for everyone, especially if u have sensitive, allergic reactions on your skin. Thanks to this product line i had great releif & improvement. Also i appreciate that instead of containing collagen, (which when applied topically cannot be absorbed by skin to increase collagen content) , it can rather stimulate collagen production in skin. This puts it a step ahead of a lot of products out there if you ask me. i will continue to use this in the long term, pregnant or not.",

I don't think so but the worst judge of old man smell is an old man (me). Whenever this becomes impossible to find I'll grow a hipster beard and switch to the \"swagger\" fragrance. Until then I'll keep using this stuff.",
                "I think the title is enough to fully justify the 5 stars. But we've tried many different body washes and have always come back to this particular brand and scent. By \"we,\" I mean I tried it, and my wife let me know if she liked the smell or not. And of course, I've grown rather accustom to the smell and even bought the matching deoterant.\n\nUnfortunately many local stores have stopped carrying this scent and have new ones which are just weird. Why would I want to smell like the jungle? Seriously. Why. Fortunately, trusty Amazon has been carrying the \"fresh\" body wash. Time to stock up and keep the wife happy!",
                "This is an excellent product at a very good price. My son is very happy to not have to look for this in the retail store for a while.",
                "Love the products old spice fresh body wash as well as the deodorant, but it seems to me the longevity of the scent is not there anymore! Doesn't last as long as it use too... hope the company is not holding back on the ingredients going a cheaper route.",
                "Combines effective cleansing with refreshing scent. When I step out of the shower my wife will often say, \"Mmm, you smell really clean!\". That's good enough for me. I give it 4 stars only because the gel is tricky to use without losing some of it down the drain. Whereas some shower gels are more \"sticky\" and stay on the hands, this product tends to the more slippery side and bits of it will escape to the shower floor. It's still good value and a fine product.",

                "Easily one of the best deals out there for body wash. Great value and good scent keeps you smelling fresh too. You can\u2019t get this in stores either so get it while you can",

This product holds with his approval and he enjoys using it. No skin reactions, and this is important because my husband suffers from eczema in the winter time. He says it doesn't irritate him to use this product. I would always recommend Old Spice. They have never disappointed my husband.",

                "This is from a woman's point of view. This product cleans my husband. That is always a plus. He doesn't smell like a dead mouse. Again, a plus. Fresh scent? Definitely not the same \"fresh\" as other products. But not an unpleasant smell. When I put long lasting in the title I meant it. I can still smell it on his clothes when I wash, even if I let the laundry pile up for a few days. For the price it is worth it for your husband not to smell like butt.",
                "Good product kind of dries out my skin which is probably related to my skin not the product itself it was a reasonable price and delivered in two days no complaints but I probably need something with more hydrating elements to adequately clean my skin",

I don't know about you, but I'd rather smell good all day then be gauranteed 3 times clean! Anyways, I have used all sort of body washes from various manufacturers and I always come back to the great scents of Old Spice.",
                "This stuff is the best. Most of the other scents seem to bother my skin, but not this one. It's great. Impossible to find locally these days as most stores carry the stuff that has so much scent stuff that it's vomit inducing. Been buying Old Spice Fresh scent soaps & deodorant since I started using deodorant. Great product.",

                "June 2015 UPDATED REVIEW - General Mills has vowed to remove all artificial colors from their KIDS BREAKFAST CEREALS, why does Imodium still contain the DIARRHEA CAUSING FD&C Blue 1 ?\n\nOriginal Review:\nTo the Manufacturers of Imodium: Please, Please remove FD&C Blue 1 and all artificial colors from the ingredients. ALL artificial colors are made from coal tar or petroleum, something our bodies do NOT need!\n\nEver since I was a young child, seemingly randomly I would develop mild to severe GI distress including severe abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea, often after I arrived otherwise healthy to school. Perplexed school officials often called my frustrated parents to come, again, pick me up from school with \"the punies\". How I hated that word! How I hated spending hours at a time glued to a toilet, doubled over in severe pain!\n\nUndoubtedly my parents would give me Imodium, and undoubtedly it would help take the edge off the pain and diarrhea, but when I was given the Imodium sure it would lessen up a bit... but it always seemed to drag the horrid experience out longer, just milder... as I grew older I began to notice the pattern, but did not understand *why*... not for many years.\n\nWhen I finally made the connection of FD&C Blue 1 *always* being connected to \"the punies\" including cramping, bloating, abdominal pain, discomfort, diarrhea and sometimes bloody stools, suddenly *everything* made sense!\n\nLike clockwork, when I consumed anything with FD&C Blue 1 again I experienced onset of GI distress symptoms. The more Blue 1 that was consumed or absorbed, the worse the symptoms. This includes far too many brands of colorful children's cereals and sugary beverages, sports drinks, PICKLES or PICKLE RELISH, many brands of *white* marshmallows, mouth wash and tooth paste, hand soap and dish detergent, lotion and unfortunately greenish colored Imodium. I was always in severe abdominal distress. Major GI issues. Again, Imodium would help - but drag out the experience longer. Finally I realized the connection.. sure enough, checking the bottle FD&C Blue 1 is listed in the ingredients. Just 1 smll dose has me doubled over in pain.. again.. or worse.\n\nImodium itself is good at what it does... However, this Imodium contains BLUE 1! FD&C BLUE 1 causes severe abdominal distress in a percentage of the population (many of whom have yet to make the connection). If you aren't sure why Blue 1 is such a bad idea, check out the FDA press release stating blue 1 is \"casually linked\" to fatalities they investigated.\n\nParents: if you aren't sure why your kids randomly seem to develop stomach aches, diarrhea, abdominal distress, bloating, cramping or worse - bloody stools, start reading the food labels of everything consumed 24-36 hours prior to onset. A pattern will undoubtedly emerge...\n\nPs there is hope! Once I learned to avoid Blue 1 (Whole Foods is the *only* grocery store where I can safely shop without scrutinizing every product label!) my life vastly improved. Now I can almost always pinpoint the now rare GI distress to a new source of Blue 1 \"contamination\" I had not yet realized; the latest being Doppler ultrasound gels used in many hospitals and clinics. Now I know to ask them to use the silver packets of clear gel...\n\nSo if you find you are reaching for the green Imodium A-D a bit too much, start keeping a food diary and find the trend, SOMETHING is potentially triggering the episodes.",
                "We've all taken imodium at one point or another and knows it's an odd taste. But this so worked on my daughter that had bad tummy to stool issues. I would definitely purchase again if I need too. And the price is right!",

                "This simplistic, clean design is a work of art - an example of form & function at its best. Extremely well built, no cheap or cheesy parts, fit & finish on the 2 units I purchased & assembled were as close to perfect as possible, considering mass production & relatively low price point for this level of quality & sheer mass, a solid strong build with a subdued muscular look/feel. The matte black rectangular steel outer frame paired with the matte finish silver round/tubular inner frame and gray smoke glass combine to quietly match any style audio/video equipment (most are either black or silver, brushed, matte or gloss) these racks compliment the equipment. The glass is thick and strong supported by this steel frame with heavy duty clear rubber/silicone like material supporting the glass to prevent scratching and more importantly to absorb vibration & prevent any kind of glass movement once set in place. The hardware is high quality, bolts /threads line up correctly, all holes are correctly drilled (plumb and square - so many other kits are not!!!) Assembly is quick/easy assuming you have some common sense experience using basic hand tools. I was concerned that the units would not be strong enough for my high end AVR & multi-channel amplifiers or stable enough for my Analog stereo old school Tube preamp/amp & Record Turntable (that requires a heavily damped vibration free surface) - I bought a pair of these racks - one for the AVR/Surround sound system for Movies (Blu-Ray/DVD, VHS, Laser Disc, Cable Box, Heavy 7 channel amp, etc..) and the other for 2 channel Analog Music sound reproduction (Tape decks, Turntable, DVD-Audio/HDCD/CD Transport & DAC, Vacuum Tube Amps/preamps/tuner/phono preamp, Graphic Equalizers etc..) - These racks are strong enough to support the extreme weight & rack parts/materials used are not affected by the extreme HEAT generated by the vacuum Tube systems, open air rack shelf design allows for the best heat dispersion/air flow & because of the rack's overall mass & low center of gravity, these are the most stable/vibration damping racks I have ever owned/used/seen, even those I have worked on located in professional recording studios, weren't built this well. This combined with a fantastic price & free shipping (when I bought them it was free) for items weighing this much - also fast delivery, you can't go wrong. After almost 3 years and no trouble other than removing dust (Good thing the metal parts do NOT show fingerprints due to textured finish, but the glass does collect dust like any other rack shelf surface material). Cable management system is minimal but functional and easily customized to suit your needs, there is plenty of room in a very wide, but shallow 3 sided box that runs the length top to bottom of the rack (approx 10\" wide, 2\" deep, Length of rack top to bottom) with large oval cut-outs in the rear of each shelf, holes have machined rounded edges so no sharp metal to cut through cable insulation & no need for messy unreliable grommets - plenty of hidden room to hide the cable and separate the high voltage Line cords from the sensitive low voltage A/V input/output cables into separate bundles. Since the back of the cable hide is wide open, it is easily accessible & new cables can be added or removed without taking anything apart. The 5 shelves are evenly spaced with plenty of H/W/D to accommodate all of my equipment with larger devices (Reel to Reel Tape, Turntables) on the top Shelves. Shelves ARE NOT ADJUSTABLE - Because the tubular steel framework that supports each shelf is welded - I rather have a strong welded frame, than weak adjustable potential points of failure on an otherwise indestructible rack system. The all Steel inner silver tubular shelf support system and outer black rectangular frame combined are a heavyweight, heavy duty system that is extremely strong, rigid and stable. Because of the size and weight, 2 adults are needed to move the empty fully assembled racks into position, IOW, these racks, even without any equipment on the shelves, is so heavy/stable that you can't move them (they don't slide on floor because of silicone feet, weight, stability) without some help lifting all 4 legs off the floor simultaneously & placing the rack where you want it. There is no way these would ever tip over, they are so correctly balanced that it would take a huge force just to push it enough to tilt it on 2 of 4 legs. I cannot think of anything negative to say nor can I think of any improvements that I would have made to these racks - I may add some RGB LEDs to the back edge of the Glass Shelves to test whether I can get the edges to light up from the front to add some color/focus on the racks - all angles are accessible so mounting LEDs are simple, if desired.\n\nLove these units and would highly recommend..",
                "This beast is 91LBS and is not something that I am concerned about falling over. I spent a loooong time debating on the benefits of having one of these towers versus using the TV stand that I currently have in the living room. Everything came to a head one day after I had upgraded my speakers and my Receiver went into power protect mode because it didn't have enough room to breathe when it was in my TV stand. I don't have much to compare it to outside of the $800+ range (my father has a really nice AV tower), but I will definitely say that I am pleased with how this product functions and it is well worth the investment if you're like me and need to get something under $300 to save yourself the headache of purchasing a new receiver.\n\nSome notes on the various aspects of this AV Tower:\n\nThe description states that the shelving is: Distances between shelves: top shelf=7 3/4\"; two center shelves=9 1/4\"; and bottom shelf=8 7/8\"\nThis is incorrect. I took a measuring tape to my AV tower and found that each shelf has 9.5\" between them.\n\nPutting it together: I cannot personally say how difficult this is to do. It's HEAVY, but my 110 LBS girlfriend put it together for me and she said that it took her about an hour because she lost the allen wrench and had to tear apart the living room to find it.\n- I have read some reviews on here where people mention that they had a lot of trouble putting the suction cups on this product. She circumvented this issue by using the alen wrench to push the suction cups in. She said that it worked really well and made it a lot easier/faster.\n\nCable Management: This is probably the weirdest misnomer on this product. There is no \"cable management.\" There are holes in the back where you let the cables hang and can zip tie them yourself if you want them \"managed.\" The odd plastic/tie down device shown in the pictures did not come with my AV tower and nothing in the 4 page instruction booklet indicates that it should have.\n- The unit itself hides cables well if you have something on the bottom shelf and use zip ties, or something along those lines to keep the cables together. Personally, I had a decent amount of excess speaker cable bunched up in the back (in case I need to pull out the receiver to work on it or change speaker cable, etc.) and I found that it hides it well due to the low to the ground construction and the slightly tinted glass/Receiver at the bottom.\n\nLooks: As many other reviewers have stated, it looks really nice. It's got a more rugged texture to the black front and back frame pieces than I had expected, but that's not a bad thing. Additionally, the glass is a bit more clear than it looks in the pictures. I didn't really notice this until I had it sitting in front of me. Again, it's not a bad thing, but it's something that someone else might care about. Overall, I think this piece matches my living room better than I had expected.\n\nSturdiness: Here's the whole reason that we all invest so much time in reading reviews. We want to know if the tower is going to break down and leave all of our expensive equipment dead on the floor. I can say that this tower is solid. I have moved it myself and have done so with a friend helping. You would have to throw quite a bit of energy at this guy to force it to fall over. It would be pretty difficult to find a more stable tower. With that said, if you are looking for a tower that has wheels this does not. I currently have this tower sitting on a area rug in the living room and there are no stability issues - despite the fact that my rug has a pattern than includes varying levels of carpet (ie some places it's very short and very long in others) and it's nearly impossible to have something sit on it that's light.\n\nOverall:\nWell worth the $230 that I paid for it. I would believe that this product goes for a higher value elsewhere. I don't often feel that way about the \"markdowns\" that amazon provides, but this product really does live up to the good reviews.\n\nI will update this as time goes by to allow other reviewers a fair shake before they purchase this. Feel free to leave a comment if you have a question. I will do my best to get to it to help you out.",
                "Just got this for a steal at $152 plus change, after taxes. I just have to say that it's really nice and has a premium look. Was it my first choice? Not at all, but there comes a time when one must accept that they do not carry the funds to be buying overpriced product that's only overpriced to appeal to people with money. This thing looks great. It feels cheap absolutely zero. I would have a hard time being more happy with anything else I can get my hands on.\n\nOn to the infos - I'm not a huge fan of the method of suction cups for the glass. It was a pain for my thumb to go through installing the cups. The very top holes where the top piece of glass goes, does not agree well at all with the cups. Press as hard as you might, it's probably not going to be enough to get them in. I took my hammer, the only practical thing I could find to hammer on that would work i.e. big enough, not small nor too big-a basic black marker, lined it up in the middle of the cup that was already as far pressed in as I could get it with my thumb, and by gently hammering I could get the cup to go all the way in. The cups and holes on the rest of the rig were a cake walk in comparison. Just press in and twist til they pop in fully.\n\n(NOTE: My size is \"football player\" massive, for the record. So of course I have large hands and as a result, thumbs. Smaller people will PROBABLY have a lot easier time installing the suction cups with much smaller thumbs. Just a heads up to not be too scared off about the suction cups. If you resort to hammer and perhaps a black marker or basic pen to hammer on, you'll probably break it like I did. My reasoning for using a marker and something bigger than the typical bolt or whatnot metal object is I was worried about ruining the suction capability of the cup. Use something big enough not to start poking through the tiny hole on the cup and it should be fine to use)\n\nThe second biggest chore was getting the top glass to go on right i.e. straight and even. I'm 6' but I imagine had I used a small step ladder I could position myself above and make a better placement. The problem that adds onto this problem is it can't be put on evenly due to the backside requiring two L shaped bars to connect the glass to the shelf, so you must connect the bars prior in order to correctly install the glass. I strongly suggest leaving the bars very loose so they work with the glass movement, and let them serve as a guideline to how far back the glass needs to go before you set it. No worries if you get it wrong, the suction cups aren't overpowering and you can retry as often as you need to get it right.\n\nYou'll also see four half circle bars which will confuse you unless someone informs you or you research them. Just do as the photo only instructions show. They will be used for attaching the glass shelves to the metal bars to better stabilize them for I guess when/if you move the tower to another location. These and the L bars will have you install a bolt to tighten to the glass for the connection. I suggest you don't over do it. I did it juuuuust enough to not be loose. Once my two towers are in place I will have zero reason to ever move them anyway, but feel free to turn it tight for another round or three if it makes you feel more secure. It is protected with a something I can't really name. I'll just say you will not be tightening metal to glass. It'll be metal bolt>something white on the end of metal bolt to protect glass>glass.\n\nAs usual I am long winded, so I'll end this quickly with - Tower is a 5 star product. Suction cup pains earns it a 4 star rating. And uh, yeah, this version involves dark glass shelves which fingerprints are particularly fond of to show themselves off. Black or dark is great but...might want to consider the clear version so you don't constantly feel compelled to whip the fingerprints off. I just got it but I see this coming from ten thousand trillion zillion miles away >:/ It's not fully blackened glass. It's more like a really dark DARK shade of sunglasses. You can still see through the glass. I am guessing this is why fingerprints show so badly.",
                "Pay close attention to the weight listed in the product description: this is NOT your bog-standard cheap-ass particleboard stereo stand. The frames are metal tubes and the beveled glass is decently thick -- which is where a lot of the weight comes from. These are why this is a $200 item vs a $100 item.\n\nNo worries whatsoever about this holding any reasonable amount of weight; in fact my eight year old son (sigh) crawled on top. It could totally support a modern TV of any size, though the overhang on the sides would make that a somewhat precarious arrangement if there were any chance of bumping -- usually a better idea to wall-mount.\n\nOne of the welded brackets that hold on the top from the rear was a bit twisted. I was able to bend it a bit, but at the cost of scratching the powdercoat. It comes with lightweight hardware to anchor to a wall -- I think the CPSC has been on furniture mfg's to include something. I didn't use it, you might want to.\n\nThe gray U frames had a couple of scuffs on them, not a dealbreaker or very noticeable once assembled.\n\nThe most awesome thing about this unit is how the hardware is packaged. Anyone who has wrestled with IKEA kits knows what I mean. Each set of hardware bits is sealed separately into a salp-link chain. Moreover each is labeled with the same part number that the instructions reference. No more wondering which screw is which. This is priceless.\n\nThe worst thing about this unit is the packaging. The metal components come wrapped in plastic bags, which is sad but usual, and thin foam sheets separate the sheets of glass. The nasty bit is that the voids and margins of the box are filled with blocks of EPS, aka styrofoam, that are taped together. This makes it impossible to remove the pieces and properly dispose of the box without EPS beads getting everywhere. IKEA mostly manages to use honeycomb cardboard for this purpose. No reason it couldn't be used here.",
                "I purchased this for my father so he could reduce the clutter of his audio and video gear and have a tower that would allow him to put his turntable on the top so he didn't have to bend over to use it. He absolutely loves it and I enjoyed that the assembly process was very easy and straight-forward.\n\nOne thing I want to mention is that the box this thing comes in is huge and weighs about 90lbs so it may be hard for some people to move it on their own. The second is there is not a huge amount of Styrofoam around the glass shelves and the first unit shipped had completely cracked and broken shelves. Major kudos to Amazon for having a quick and easy exchange process that allowed for the UPS guy to drop off a new one and pick up the old one in just a few days.\n\nThe tower is comprised of a few heavy-duty metal pieces and glass shelves. The assembly process was quite easy due to the fact that every small part was packaged and labeled clearly. A small tool that is included is all you really need for installation though I found having a small hammer around to get the suction cups that hold the shelves stable made the process a whole lot easier.\n\nOnce assembled this tower is a virtual tank. One thing to remember, and they do warn against this in the instructions, is that when you are moving the tower to grab the metal pieces and not the glass since the glass is not permanently secured. Each glass shelf can handle up to 50lbs which should be fine for most audio gear.\n\nOverall this tower was easy to put together and looks good. Recommended.",
                "An attractive and well-built audio tower. All the pieces were well-finished and will complement even the finest audiophile or videophile equipment. Keep in mind that this is a open-air tower with only minimal enclosure (on the back there is a metal plate that serves as a backstop as well as a cable guide.) This is mostly good though as air flow is always a concern when using electronics and with the Bush Midnight Mist tower your equipment will have plenty of opportunity to acquire cooler outside air and expel any warmer exhaust. Construction of the unit is straightforward but can be tricky for one person especially when joining the four posts and installing the tempered glass. Having a partner is recommended - particularly if you are not a buff/beefy specimen such as myself! (LOL!) The unit is sturdy and all but the heaviest equipment can be handled without too much issue (some of the larger amplifiers and receivers and certainly many power conditioners/UPS units may need to be located elsewhere.) But keep the weight on any one of the tempered glass shelves under 50 pounds and everything will be hunky.\n\nIf I have any quibble with the Midnight Mist is that the metal plate spanning the center back of the unit could have been made slightly larger and with more ports to more easily accommodate all the connectors and cords that audio-video setups can require. But that is being very picky indeed - this is a well-made and classy place to put your home electronics - be it a three thousand dollar Luxman amplifier or more modest components. Regardless of pedigree all components will look good (or at least better) sitting within this quality piece of audio furniture. Five stars.",
                "We were looking for a shelving unit to hold all of our media components (tivo, dvd, play station, receiver, internet router) to accompany our wall-mounted 60 inch tv. This was a great size for what we were looking for... perhaps slightly bigger than it seemed in the photos, but its in-person impression is elegant and unobtrusive, so the size wasn't a problem or a deterrent.\n\nTo echo what so many other reviewers have said, this is an exceptional product. It's well worth the money paid, and I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly it arrived at our door, considering we live in Alaska and did not choose to pay for any upgraded shipping.\n\nIt took my husband just under an hour to put together, and there were no problems with misaligned parts/holes, missing products etc. as some others have run into. Overall, it's a great shelving unit for a great price. While the openings in the panel to manage the cords in back aren't huge, we had no problem threading the cords we needed through them, and felt like if they were much bigger (as some reviewers have wished), it would actually make the cords more visible, and decrease the effectiveness of the cord-hiding back panel.\n\nWe have nothing bad to say about our experience. Going on two weeks of ownership and it seems to be holding up like a champ with all of our media components stacked in it successfully. Seems super stable and very durable. No reason to think it won't continue to be a great piece of furniture for many many years into the future.\n\nDefinitely recommend this!",
                "Wow was this thing heavy. Assembly took about an hour, while watching TV. Definitely get all the screws started before tightening them down. I did not, and I had to loosen a few up to get things to align. Once the frame was together you put plastic suction cup things (yes very technical term) on the top them to hold the glass up. They were a bugger to get in. I licked a few to squeeze them into the frame holes. Getting those little suckers in place was the hardest part of this build, but critical to keep the glass from hitting the shelves. Once they were in the glass was placed easily. The shelves are heavy - I never realized glass was so heavy. The top sheet has a couple clamps on it in the back. The TV weight limit is 50 pounds.\n\nI was able to fit a cable box, Xbox on one shelf. I also put some Games/Blue rays standing up on the bottom shelf. We actually bought a second one (off a local trading site), as a electronic shelf for the tv setup upstairs. So, we would buy it again.\nUltimately we removed the one upstairs for a different type of shelf, that would hold the tv and all the equipment, instead of having the equipment next to the wall mounted TV.",
                "All in all this is a great piece of furniture. That being said, however, there were some problems which are still being dealt with. When the item was received one of the welds on the tubular side rails was broken off. Contacted the company and a very nice young lady promised to get the part out to me right away, which she did. Received the part in good condition and constructed it without incident. Upon putting the unit in my living room and installing the stereo equipment I discovered that the cross pieces on the replacement tubular unit were 3/4\" higher than on the other tubular unit. This makes the shelves on the entire unit look like they are leaning to one side. Makes a great conversation piece but not exactly what I had hoped for. I am still in the process of working this out with the company. I will say that they are quick to respond and are serious about doing what is right. So, we will see what transpires. I would not discourage anyone from purchasing this unit. Just suggest that they measure the crosspieces before they assemble it to be sure they are the same.\nUpdate to this scenario. Bush industries representative has informed me that they will be checking their replacement parts to be sure they are correct and then will be sending me a replacement part, which means I have to deconstruct it and then reconstruct it, after removing all my stereo equipment. I hope this goes better than the first time.",
                "This thing looks great, holds lots of equipment, and was easy easy easy to setup. It gives plenty of space for each unit and lots of airflow. I needed to get this thing setup in a crunch, I had my A/V installers on their way to complete installation of my audio/video/surveillance system and I hated the rack they \"sold\" to me. I got this thing out of the box, laid out, and put together in less than 25 mins. I had no help (you don't need any). Everything in the box is clearly labeled and the instructions (for once) were very clear and labeled every screw you need in each step and where it went. Each different type of screw was in a separate bag that was labeled. Each metal part, and glass plate was labeled as well. I don't understand the people who said they needed 2 people to put this together. You don't. I actually think another person would just get in the way, but maybe not. Either way, it wouldn't save much time having 2 people doing it. Anyone is perfectly capable of putting this together by themselves.\nTHIS IS NOT IKEA INSTRUCTIONS!!! It is very clear, very very clear. It doesn't try to combine 5 steps into 1 step. Its easy.\nI personally put this in my media closet because I like the minimal look in my living room, but this could look fantastic in a living room.",
                "I was stunned at how high quality this piece of furniture is, for the price. I'm used to buying small furniture (desks, bookcases, coffee tables) and assembling the particle board pieces, finding creative ways to replace the pieces that are inevitably missing.... I'm sure that sounds familiar for many of you. But this piece from Bush Furniture was nothing like that! The instructions were very clear, all of the different pieces of hardware were individually bagged and clearly labeled, the glass shelves were well packed, and the metal frame pieces are extremely solid and look much more expensive than this tower actually is. Assembly took about 2 hours (at a leisurely pace) and four hands were necessary several times. The only I'd make different is the cable holes along the back panel; I have a power regulator on my bottom shelf (fancy surge protector for AV components) and couldn't fit all of the cables through the organizer porthole. No big deal, though. Plenty of room for all my cables on each of the other shelves. I love the glass top especially - it makes a good home for the record player. The other shelves hold my AVR, HTPC, Wii U, Xbone, and PS4.\nI love this thing so much that I've actually looked up other products from Bush and will certainly buy from them again in the future.",
                "This media stand looks great. It's sturdy and strong. Assembly was simple and straight forward.\n\nThe only problem was the product condition upon delivery. I bought it in like new condition from Amazon Warehouse Deals. I normally have no troubles with orders like this, but this had obviously been mistreated. One of the tempered glass shelves was shattered in the box, and the back panel piece had a bent corner on the bottom.\n\nAmazon worked with me, and with Bush to get a new shelf sent to me, which was good of them. I used a pair of pliers to bend the corner back, relatively into place. Since the stand is in the back corner of my theater room, this defect is never seen, thankfully.\n\nAll in all, it's a great stand, but it loses a star due to poor condition upon delivery.",
                "This audio tower stand is awesome. It looks very modern and it's very sturdy.\n\nThe box it came in was very heavy. I just took it apart in the garage and carried the different pieces separately into the house. It was packed very well and all pieces were perfect with no dents, dings, or scratches. Was very pleased with that.\n\nThe directions were clear. There are no written instructions, just drawings. You just need to go slow, review the different steps first, and become familiar with all the parts and hardware, which are all labeled very clearly. I have assembled lots of furniture and other items in the past, and this was one of the easiest.\n\nEverything fit together perfectly. I put it together myself. No problem. As a few others have mentioned, the hardest part for me (and it wasnt that big of a deal) was putting in the suction cups. I just pressed hard and used the handle of a pair of scissors to help push/twist them into place.\n\nAll in all, I am so happy with this purchase! Just buy it! You won't regret it.",
                "I was looking for an attractive, sturdy and roomy A/V rack to house my home theater equipment, and decided to give this a try. It was a GREAT decision. It easily fit three 90-pound power amplifiers, 1 pre/pro amplifier and my Blu-ray player.\n\nMore details below:\n\n1. This was big enough to house all of my A/V components with the exception of my PC and XBOX. My XBOX will actually fit if I place it on top of another component, but I decided to have it stand next to the rack.\n\n2. This rack gives each component room to breathe. Each of my five components have good space above and behind for air to flow, which makes me feel better about heat dissipation and wear/tear.\n\n3. The unit looks beautiful.\n\n4. The unit is simple to put together. You will need someone to help you hold pieces in place, but it can be assembled quickly (30 mins or so). It also comes with the tools you need to assemble it.\n\n5. The unit feels fairly strong and the tempered glass seems feels equally as strong. My 90-pound amps don't seem to phase it at all.\n\n6. The back cord strip does a nice job hiding the cords from front views. It look much neater than my previous entertainment center.\n\n7. Awesome value for the price.\n\nWould HIGHLY recommend this for folks looking for something that looks great, is sturdy and can fit A/V separates.",
                "Being allergic to most assemble yourself furniture, I set out to find an audio rack made exclusively of metal and glass. One that was heavy and stable enough for my vintage turntable to ride on top. This one ticked all those boxes and at a mere $185 shipped Prime directly from Amazon.\n\nAt 91 lbs it's a beast, but by myself and taking my sweet time, I had it together within an hour. Went together very well. No missing parts. I did use a more robust 4mm L wrench than the one included because I had it on hand.\n\nIt's an absolute work of art and the pics do in no justice! I cut 4 pieces from a mouse pad to further isolate the stand from my hardwood floor and allow it to slide.\n\nIt housed all my A/V components with a unused shelf to spare:\n\nTurntable\nPhono Preamp\n5-Disc CD Changer\n1-Disc CD Player\nBluray Player\nA/V Receiver\nBluetooth Adapter\n\nIt does a fair job of concealing wires, mine is a birdsnest and that reflects my shortcomings, not the stands.\n\nThis is a BEAUTIFUL component rack. I'm proud to own it, and I'd recommend it to everyone!",
                "I received this item about two weeks ago. It came in a very nice, tightly-bound box with lots of styrofoam insulation to protect the various parts.\n\nTook my wife and me about 30 minutes to put together after we got it unboxed and laid out.\n\nAll of the hardware was in the box, including allen wrenches, screws and little suction cups. Instructions, which consist solely of illustration, were sufficient. I'm not very mechanically inclined at all and I could have easily put it together with no instructions whatsoever. However, it is a two person job to build this behemoth because everything but the cable manager is pretty heavy/unwieldy.\nFinished product? Very nice furniture! It's modern looking and the tinted glass makes it far more attractive than your average glass furniture. And it is very heavy and sturdy too - that is something that I have to have!\nThe only improvement that it could stand? An enclosed cable management system - maybe a little snap-on piece of metal or plastic that would completely cover the wires going up the back. I only say that because I hate to manage the cable mess - I just want to cover it!\nThis is my first ever online furniture purchase and I feel that I got a good product at a good price.",
                "I am very happy with my purchase of this AV tower. I assembled it alone with no problem, closely following instructions which were adequate. I tightened the screws while the unit was on it's side, as the instructions said. When I stood the unit up it was lopsided, so had to loosen the screws and re tighten them in the standing position to get the rack to stand without wobbling - adding weight also helps. I used 2 tiny screwdrivers to insert the suction cups, the rubbery substance being very durable. One piece of glass was chipped along one edge due to a factory cutting problem. I called Bush Furniture, explained the problem and they cheerfully sent me another piece of glass - they had seen this problem previously. The AV Tower is an awesome unit, very sturdy and beautifully appealing to the eye. The sale price was what sealed the deal. Be aware that glass shelves require a lot of dusting and/or cleaning to look nice. I find the width of the wire routing metal piece to be adequate. The shelves are all evenly vertically spaced. I use this unit as an input device rack, below my 55\" TV hanging from the wall above it.",
                "Well due to the aesthetics and stellar reviews here I purchased this rack and will have to admit for most general applications it is perfect. Great looking quality rack and a good price. BUT for anyone with a true audiophile system or if you are planning to build one I would stay clear. Only after researching did I find each shelf is suggested to not support more than 50lbs and if you are getting quality components most amps will well exceed this number. I know many reviews people have said they have 100lb units and all is fine but being the shelves are glass, all being fine temporarily doesn't do it for me. Two of my Mcintosh Amps weigh over 133lbs and I wouldn't dare risk it. Not that I even had the option to risk it since both of my amps are 9.5 inches high and each shelf will only accommodate 9\" and are NOT adjustable so keep that in mind as well. For one large component the bottom glass can be removed giving a few more inches but it will then be resting on the floor.\n\nIn total great unit for most but make sure of your total weight and height of not just your components now but what you might add in the future. Also really no need for glass shelves since your components will cover them anyway. If this unit had steel adjustable shelves it would be perfect and this is what I had to replace it with. Sadly I didn't not look into these things and with it build and it just wasn't an option to return.",
                "Well constructed and a slick look. I scoured the internet (mostly Amazon) and this was the best value in mid- to upper-range A/V tower (marked down from $400 to $215). I put my new Onkyo TX-NR809 (also on sale for $499 through Amazon) in the top inner shelf and the other components below it. My center channel speaker sits on the top glass shelf just below my wall-mounted flat panel TV. The glass shelves sit on some rubber (silicone?) suction cups that isolate from scratches or vibrations. They are locked in place with plastic-tipped threaded set screws.\n\nThe top inner shelf accessibility isn't as good as the lower shelves because of impingement by the black metal frame. I had to bring my receiver in through the side. If the unit was a little bit deeper (1-2\") that would be ideal as it was difficult getting all the cables plugged in. The back panel of the Audio tower and the slits in the back panel could be a bit wider to better manage and hide all of the cables from A/V equipment. If the unit had lockable casters, that would be good as well. Otherwise I can't complain.",
                "This audio stand is beautiful. It makes me want to buy a better looking stereo.\n\nIt's also solid as a rock. I just wish it was square. Quality control needs to be tightened up during the manufacturing process. If it didn't weigh 90 lbs. and would have been a b-word to repack, I would have sent it back.\n\nThe \"vibration dampening pads\" are just suction cups. For the money, I was expecting a real anti-vibration system.\n\nI do have to give Bush Furniture a shout out for cleaning up Amazon's mess: my shipment was missing the parts list and assembly instructions and the hardware pack was torn so screws and small parts were scattered all over the box. I called Bush Customer Service and they emailed me a PDF of the parts list so I could take inventory and recontact them to have any missing parts sent via overnight. Very good customer service."

                "I love that the cabinet matches my other Bush furniture, and it shipped quickly. On the downside, it had damage to the back panel that is visible on both sides (see photo taken as we were unboxing the product). After my husband determined that it probably would not impact the structural integrity, we decided to \"live with it\". He put it together and there were two issues with the hardware. The door lock only seems to lock one door, which is useless since the entire width of the cabinet can still be accessed by opening the other door. Secondly, as a tip for others, he said that the best way to install the doors (the hinges) was to remove the adjustment screws first and then slide the door's hinges all the way into the receiving hardware, and then everything should be pretty square and straight if the cabinet was correctly assembled. My only other comment is that a couple of hours after I placed the order, I realized that i had accidentally used our debit card instead of my Amazon store card (my intended payment method) and I didn't catch it at that moment (my fault). So I asked this company to cancel the order so I could reorder again with my preferred payment method, and they said basically just said \"No\". I had also ordered another Bush office furniture piece that was through a different company on Amazon, and they were very helpful and accommodating (quite pleasant). So that aspect compared between these two companies was like night and day. So I definitely didn't want to try to return this one with the damaged part after the prior attempt to work with them to cancel this order. The cabinet itself looks good with my other furniture and will prove to be quite useful.",
                "This is the second Bush cabinet that I\u2019ve built. Yes, the locking mechanism is weak, but I didn\u2019t buy the cabinet for security. I wish that Bush had included a plug of some kind to fill the lock hole. Assembly was straightforward and relatively easy. It is very heavy, 89 pounds, but it is also very robust being able to support 100 pounds on top easily. I actually had to order this twice. The first time, FedEx lost the box somewhere in New Mexico where it still remains. Bush was quick refund the amount I paid for that shipment. I repurchased it and it was here in just a few days, instead of taking a circuitous route around the western US like the first one...",
                "The BBF brand is one of the best RTA furniture you can get and super easy to assemble with clear instructions. I have been buying BBF pieces for 16 years and will continue.\n\nThe 30\u201d width of this cabinet perfect as a printer stand with room for an inbox tray on the side. I like this better than the piler piece at only 24\u201d.\n\nThe Cherry laminate of this Series C piece matches my Series A pieces but I prefer the rounded corners of Series A. This piece has right angle corners.\n\nThis has a backside hole with grommet for cords if you want to power something behind the doors.",

                "I purchased this cabinet for extra storage in my home office. It is attractive in appearance but putting it together gave my husband a bit of a challenge. (Could be his skills!) I ordered a second shelf which added more space for what I needed. Why it isn't part of the initial offering I don't know. The lock is quite cheesy and so if you're trying to protect any secure documents forget about it. All you need to do is pull hard on the doors even with the lock on and they open. A few screws were missing but the customer service at the company was great and they sent them immediately. I am overall satisfied with the piece. I guess for the price it is a good addition.",
                "I have purchased about 7 various pieces this Bush Business Furniture in Hansen Cherry. I am a bit neurotic when it comes to office furniture and I wanted something that would last. It had to be able to take the abuse of well\u2026.actually using it.\nI must say that I have been impressed so far. All of the sets came shipped on varying days from different shippers over a one week period. The packing is very impressive. Each piece of wood inside the box is wrapped in foam and/or foam like paper. One box appeared to have taken a beating, but no damage to the items. Several boxes weighed over 120lbs.\nAssembly varied depending on the item. If it had drawers, it took longer than a desk with two legs. Following the instructions was easy as long as you made sure you chose the correct fasteners for each step. (correct screws)\nThey look very nice with thick laminate and they are extremely sturdy. If you want a commercial grade product at a fair price, look no further.",
                "This office set is awesome! Not only is the product outstanding, so is the customer service folks. I had a small dig in the top of my desk and they sent me another top. I would definitely recommend to anyone. I don't use the locks, so can't provide info on the issue that everyone has complained about. If you follow the instructions, you'll be fine. Let's face it, locks only keep out honest people. They look amazing!",
                "Used for extra office storage space and surface.",
                "I needed a solid cabinet with a lock for use at our church by one of our groups and this one turned out great. It's a solid, heavier cabinet that I got in a lighter finish. The cabinet is a good size with an adjustable shelf and I was able to add casters without any problem. Assembly is pretty simple and the instructions are clear.",
                "GOOD PRICE, WELL PACKAGED, WE ASSEMBLED IT IN JUST OVER AN HOUR.\nRECOMMENDED.",
                "I love the quality of this cabinet along with the matching desk. I did receive one piece that was damaged in shipping but Bush replaced the piece, no questions asked. Great customer service.",
                "The product delivered late, and the box and some boards inside are damaged during shipping.\n\nThe assemble is not super difficult. However, I found the lock does not work. The cabinet can be opened even it is locked.",
                "We were looking for a cabinet that locked so that is the main reason we chose the Series C Collection 30W Storage Cabinet. We were disappointed because, although it does lock, it doesn't lock well. To begin with, the locking mechanism simply locks against the other door rather than connecting the 2 doors and latching against something else. What this means to me is that it can be opened without a key even it if it locked. All that is necessary is to pull the doors open far enough the locking latch will simply separate from the other door. This really doesn't help me. For anyone needing a cabinet that securely locks, this is not the one!",
                "I have put together alot of stuff and this was very easy.",
                "Heavy-duty storage, very attractive as well.",
                "Purchased this office storage cabinet to replace a much older cabinet. Had my IT guy assemble it with no problems at all. Very sturdy and heavy as well. Buy it!!",
                "Very nice for the price, we ordered one from Office Max, identical to this one, but discovered it was a better price on Amazon, so ordered second one from Amazon. Paid less, got it faster. Bush makes very sturdy furniture. It can be time consuming putting together. We put together serveral pieces to make a work center and they all matched perfectly.",
                "I am not good a putting these sorts of things together but this was amazingly easy I did not swear once while working on it! Only draw back is the lock doesn't really work.",
                "The cabinets are in very good size and appearance to fit our needs. But there is big crack on one of the doors when arriving which was not caused by delivery since packaging was not damaged. All the communications were smooth. The manufacturer sent replacement pretty fast. If they could do their QC better before shipping, we would all save time and cost.",
                "Easy to put together and looks nice. On arrival two pieces were damaged and a short call to BBF had replacement pieces on the way that same day.\n\nI recently remodeled my home office and got 6 pieces from this BBF furniture line. They are all solid, sturdy and they look good. As I noted in my other reviews, I'm a bit concerned about the laminate being thin and, therefore, scratching easily. I'm being gentle and haven't had any problem so far."

I get paid by the job, not by the hour, so faster is better.\nI was recently hired to clean a one bed/ one bath rental that was in very bad shape. The man had been evicted and it didn\u2019t look like he\u2019d ever cleaned the place. Saying it was awful is no small exaggeration.\n\nI had just purchased this product, based on the reviews alone. I couldn\u2019t believe how well it cleaned!! Things that I thought would have to be scrubbed, wiped off clean with a paper towel. A greasy hood, a filthy glass stovetop, a doorway that was covered in something\u2026.all wiped clean!! I did have to use a razor to get some dried up gunk off the stovetop and in the oven, but even that was easier\u2026.\nThe shine it left behind? Oh, my goodness.\n\nWhat I thought would be a two or three day job, took 10 hours. I even sprayed it on the floor to mop. I also sprayed it on the walls to mop the nicotine stains off. I only went through one bottle and used it on everything!\n\nThe landlord was so completely impressed, that not only did she pay me my two day rate, she tipped me an extra $100.00. I had to tell her about these products. Hopefully, I\u2019ll get all her business.\n\nI also got the daily shower cleaner for my own home and am equally impressed. I love the way it smells.\n\nI can\u2019t wait to try their other products!",

No other brand of cleaner has done thay for me so easily and without physical force. But, it\u2019s only the lavender one. The grapefruit one is great but works slightly less well (which is too bad cuz it smells great). Anyways the lavender smells great too - it deodorizes.

                "I'm a bit of a newcomer to this product but have used gel-type anti-perspirants for several years now. As many others have realized, it's awesome not having the white flaky residue and ruined clothing that I used to get from using the white-solid anti-perspirants.\n\nFRAGRANCE - 3.8/5.0\nIn my opinion I find the fragrance of this product to be almost gender neutral, meaning men or women could probably use it. I'll be honest, my girl likes the smell, but not nearly as much as some of the other products like Speed Stick Gel that have more traditionally \"manly\" scents. That being said, the Old Spice High Endurance Sport Scent can be more appropriate for business environments where you just want to smell clean (like soap), and not like you're wearing cologne in preparation to go out to the club! Also, this product has a fairly strong level of scent, especially right after application. If you or someone close to you is sensitive to strong fragrances, apply a bit less of the Old Spice if you're going to be in close proximity to them for a while.\n\nAPPLICATOR - 3.0/5.0\nI don't exactly love the applicator. Most other products click up in small increments when you turn the applicator. The Old Spice doesn't click so it's harder to know how much you have raised the product since it's crystal clear. I don't want to apply too much so I raise it just a bit at a time and end up having to go back and raise it more until I can start to feel it apply to my skin. This is just a bit more aggravating and time consuming than clicking it up one or two notches and knowing how much product will be dispensed. It's not the end of the world, but it's noticeable to me.\n\nPERFORMANCE - 4.8/5.0\nOne of my favorite things about this stuff is how long it lasts. I can usually go a full 24 hrs and still smell great. This is probably the longest lasting deodorant I have ever used! It seems to have the same active ingredient and percentage as other similar products but it pretty much outlasts everything else I have used.\n\nWASH-ABILITY - 4.5/5.0\nTo me one of the most important things to consider with a deodorant product is how well it washes off my skin and clothing. I hate the products that are so waterproof they don't wash off clean even after a hot shower. Most of the white-solid anti-perspirants are like that, but so are some gel products. Also, I don't want the product to build up in the armpits of my shirts even after being laundered - again, the white-solid products are the worst culprits for this. I find the Old Spice High Endurance to be quite easy to wash away in the shower, and I haven't noticed any build-up in my shirts, which is awesome for such an effective product!\n\nAVERAGE SCORE: 4.0\n\n**** RECOMMENDED! - 4 STAR ****",
                "The price is Too high! This deodorant used to be $3 a tube and now it averages $5-$6 which I think is ridiculous.",
                "The product is good, like many other positive reviewers said. The smell is very strong, it could overshadow your other deodorant. It takes a over 5 minutes to dry up unless you blow air on it. It is all depend on your preference.\nThe only bad thing is the seller, who like many other reviewers said send missing items. It said 6 and I paid for 6 but ended up receiving only 3 items. I had to go through all the hassle of customer service, etc. The customer service is nice, but I wish I don't have to deal with this seller again.\nHate to write nasty reviews but seller carelessness causes time wasted and trust issue.",

The shipping box was fine so I guess it shipped broken.\n\nI can\u2019t comment on ease of assembly because I didn\u2019t get that far. If it was better quality I\u2019d see if it could be repaired but I\u2019ll be returning. Amazon doesn\u2019t offer product support and directs you to contact the manufacturer, and I would rather just return it than deal with a furniture store\u2019s customer service process.\n\nI gave it two stars because it does look like the photos and it would be pretty if it weren\u2019t damaged, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product and definitely don\u2019t think it\u2019s \u201csturdy\u201d or \u201cgiftable\u201d which Amazon asks for a rating on.",
                "Loved this. Still have it",
                "Very sturdy and solid. My husband put it together with no problems and it is perfectly suited to the purpose. The drawers and hinges all work smoothly and I am delighted that the shipping was free, as it was quite a heavy package. Definitely glad I took the chance on furniture from Amazon, which I\u2019ve been very hesitant to purchase in the past, due to the potential complications with returns. There were no issues here and I\u2019m very happy with the purchase.",
                "I love this. It wasn't hard. My husband put it together and I really like the side compartments for necklaces. More space than I can use. My husband even commented on how good it looks.\n\nI think the color and quality is very good. Yes there was a couple of spots where red showed throw the black, like a distressed look but I liked it.",
                "Great product for the price. Doesn\u2019t look cheap. Was very easy to assemble, took me less than twenty minutes. My only dislike was that they placed a large sticker directly in the side of the chest, which took me longer to remove and wash off. Nicely made. Made the perfect gift.",
                "This was easy to put together, all you need is a screwdriver. Took about 20 minutes total. Once assembled, There was a slight wobble and it was apparent that it would be easily tipped over. However, it came with a wall anchor and anti-tip strap to prevent this. The jewelry stand needs to sit an inch or so off the wall in order to fully open the necklace cubbies (located on each side). There is a mirror installed on the lid, and the first two drawers have compartments built in for sorting.",
                "These is very pretty. Very easy to assemble and doesn\u2019t look cheap at all. I am very impressed with it.",
                "I had always wanted a jewelry armoire, but didn't want to spend a ton of $$ for one. The reviews for this product were 50/50....some people loved it....others, not so much. Because it was only $88 at the time, I figured I'd give it a shot, and if worse came to worse, I'd return it. I received it surprisingly quick and opened the box right away. It was packed very protectively and was super easy to put the legs on. It is a bit top heavy, but, they actually have a chain on the back of it to attach to the wall so it won't fall over. I didn't think it was that bad, so I didn't attach it....but the option is there just in case. There was a faint varnish smell, which has gone away already. They drawers are roomy....two of them are sectioned...the others are are not. The top opens for more storage and has a ring section as well....there's also a mirror. And lastly the sides open to hooked cabinets for hanging necklaces. A ton of storage in this thing and it is beautiful....matches my bedroom set perfectly. Couldn't be happier! It was exactly what I wanted....beautiful and inexpensive----and loads of storage!",
                "I was very impressed with the quality and the build of this item. The price was good it showed up and basically you just had to put the legs on and the top piece so it was four screws at the bottom with the washers etc. and three screws for the top piece and it was done there\u2019s also one screw if you want to attach it to the wall but who really ever does that? I believe it\u2019s solid wood it doesn\u2019t feel like any kind of particle or anything like that and it\u2019s very very nice. I\u2019ve seen similar items in stores smelling musty and nasty this one arrived smelling wonderful.",
                "A little misleading. I was expecting it to be a bit taller, but apparently the dimensions include the top panel flipped up. I was using this for candles and such, more than jewelry, so kind of a bust. Beautiful and sturdy, just not what I was expecting. Also, the drawer dividers don't come out.",
                "The Powell Ebony Jewelry Armoire is exactly as advertised. The assembly was extremely easy and only required the use of a Phillips screw driver to attach the four legs of the Armoire. The Armoire is sturdy, made of good quality wood and adds nicely to a room as a piece of furniture. The Armoire has the ability to attach to the wall so that is does not tip or fall forward. I have not found a need to use this feature as the Armoire stands alone effectively without being anchored to the wall. The Armoire has four drawers with plenty of sectioned off, divided space to place earrings or bracelets that you can separate by gold, silver or costume and also has two large, deep drawers that will hold a combination of jewelry types. I was able to hang large bulky necklaces in the side doors and still be able to close the side doors completely. The mirror is also a nice added feature. The Powell Ebony Jewelry Armoire gets an A+.",
                "This armoire is well built and has plenty of space for my wife's jewelry. It would be a 5 star, but the lid has a red line all the way around the edge. Can't see it unless you are looking for it because it is a dark red line on a black surface, so it isn't worth returning it for that reason, but a disappointment just the same.",
                "The product seems nice so far, but I was disappointed there were not assembly instructions included. Going to Powell's website, I found the product online but no instructions. I think I figured it out and assembled it correctly, but not having instructions or even an owner's manual was odd. Otherwise it looks very nice, it seems sturdy, and it fit all my jewelry with room to spare.",
                "This is a fabulous Jewelry Armoire. If your countertop jewelry box is overflowing, then this Armoire might just be what the doctor ordered.\n\nPICS\n\nI have posted quite a few pics... as they say, a picture is worth a thousand words.\n\nTHE CAVEATS\n\n1. There are no individual length-wise compartments for bracelets.\n\n2. There are no individual small-size boxed compartments for earrings.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nOther than the two caveats, I love this jewelry armoire. Easy to put together... took all of 10-minutes. You will need only a Phillips-head screwdriver for the Legs and the Mirrored Lid. And that's it.\n\nOh, and you'll probably want to use a Lint-Brush as there will probably be dust from the manufacturing process/warehousing/shipping; and bits of styrofoam from the packing. It cleans-up very nicely.\n\nI got this on-sale, and it's worth every penny... especially when you look at the price of other Jewelry Armoires. Of course, the cost of the others is because they are usually larger thus holding more jewelry. I would call this an intermediate Armoire... a perfect size for organizing an overflowing jewelry box, and a lovely addition to one's decor, *s*.",
                "The overall product is nice. No issues with the product other than a couple of the parts that I will be contacting the company about to see if they will resolve them. Afterall, they do provide a six month warranty.",
                "This was easy for me to put together, only took about a half hour. It is very sturdy and looks very nice in my room. Holds a decent amount of jewelry. No missing pieces or scratches. Overall very happy with the quality and the price!",
                "Love the functionality and overall look but it came with these ugly red \u201cdistressed\u201d marks. Seems like in other reviews not everyone\u2019s had the red lines. I plan on taking a black wood marker to cover them up. But it looks like a mistake instead of a design feature.",
                "Lots of red lines which I found odd. Drawers stick.",
                "Love the look, not very sturdy but I was willing to get past that, this morning after one day of use one of the doors fell off. Now trying to connect with someone to discuss this is a pain. Something to be said about good old customer service!"

                "I've spent way too much money on expensive hairsprays and it is nice to find a reasonably priced product. I found this in my elderly mother's bathroom when I was visiting and spritzed it on as a touch up. I was so pleasantly surprised with the results that I came here to Amazon to buy my own. Now that I've used it a few times, I'm still happy with the hairspray. I have very fine hair, and this hairspray doesn't gum it up. It does go on sticky at first, but if you are patient and don't touch your hair for a bit after using, it dries up nicely and the stickiness goes away. It's light enough that it doesn't gum up my very fine hair, however here is enough hold to tame fly away strands and doesn't cause my hair to frizz up as some hairsprays have done. It doesn't add any shine to my hair nor does it make it look dull. It allow my hair to look natural and doesn't cause that hardened hairspray use. It also helps to keep the volume in my hair after blowing it dry, although since my hair is so fine there is always some flattening as the day goes on no matter what products I use. I prefer unscented hairsprays, which is why I only gave this product 4 stars. The scent isn't overpowering through and is light and fairly pleasant, I would just prefer to not have any scent at all.",
                "Yes, the hold is great, but the scent is AWESOME! It\u2019s the only hairspray I\u2019ll use. It does not have that classic alcohol type smell at all. I don\u2019t need too much (thanks to the great hold) so combined with the mild citrus smell, it\u2019s hard to tell I even have it on. Highly recommend.",

I have been using Herbal Essences Body Envy mousse for several years now, and I always tried to buy an extra bottle or two every time I was at the store, so that I wouldn't run out. Then for about a month my local Walmart was sold out every time I went in! I tried some of the other Herbal Essences products, but they didn't work as well. I broke down and bought this 12 pack from Amazon and I couldn't be happier. I think I will be buying in bulk from them from now on!\n\nMy hair will dry straight, but with some scrunching and encouragement and a healthy dose of this mousse, it will get kinky-curly and stay that way all day. I scrunch it into wet hair in the morning and then just go! Sometimes I put more in as my hair is drying but still damp, a few hours after I have been at work. If my hair has gone a little flat the second round of mousse will perk it up. It washes out easily the next morning, and does not leave residue behind. And did I mention that it has a nice scent? I get a lot of compliments on how good it smells.\n\nFive star product all the way!",

The first day I used it, I sprayed on the amount I usually do, and my hair felt like cement. It wasn't soft or touchable at all. I was not happy and felt a one star review coming on. I decided to try it another day and this time I held the can further away, and sprayed just one or two sprays here and there. That's how to get the softer, more natural hold everyone was raving about. It's now my new favorite. Also, this can is enormous! I am sure I'll have it for a very long time.",

This is NOT for make-up remover; this is a gentle cleanse.\n\nIf used heavily, without basic skin care (moisturizing, sunscreen), and with other salicylic and glycolic acid based products -- the face wash can be drying.\nDepending on how much acne is pending (i.e. waiting to happen due to build-up, hormones, stress, etc) - overuse of this face wash can cause breakouts - just like using retinol or hyaluronic acid, initially there's adjustment and breakouts.\n\nA pea size amount is perfect, if needed I'll do a double take. This is NOT moisturizing so if you have dry skin, use a smaller amount (just a dab and maybe lather in your hands first before scrubbing/washing your face).\n\nThe Amazon pack of three SHOULD include an expiration date on each bottle; if the expiration date is too close to when you purchase the product, don't hesitate to reach out to customer service.

                "In order to take good care of your facial skin, the standard advice is to cleanse, exfoliate, tone, and moisturize, in that order. I tend to skip exfoliation because I find it doesn't do me much good. For cleansing it's important that you find a cleanser that is effective enough to remove the excess oil and any other dirt from your skin, but not so aggressive as to irritate the skin. Neutrogena has a good reputation for making effective but gentle skin products and this is no exception. Then, there is salicylic acid. This is a somewhat effective medication for treating hyperactive sebaceous glands, which produce the sebum that can clog the pores, ultimately leading to acne. It's not strong enough to work for all cases of acne, but it's fairly mild as far as these things go, so if it's strong enough for your particular case of acne, it's a good one to go with. It didn't used to cut it for me when my acne was worse, but as I've gotten older my acne has become milder, and it turns out that by using this cleanser every day while showering, I am pretty much able to constrain my acne to a very occasional lonely zit. The occasional zits are small and disappear quickly without becoming big, infected, or painful. The cleanser is an excellent vehicle for delivering this medication to the skin. Neutrogena and its competing brand, Clean & Clear, also make toners and moisturizers that contain the same ingredient. It generally doesn't hurt to use those as well; a little extra salicylic acid from using multiple products that contain it does not seem to become too much very soon. (You'll notice if it becomes too much because it will dry out the skin too much.) I have been purchasing this product and various store-brand knock offs of this product for many years, and it has served me well. These days, because I know I use it anyway, I tend to just order it on Amazon, and get a few at a time. It's actually usually cheaper, and easier to remember.",
                "Does exactly what it states on the bottle. It takes a few weeks to begin working so don't discontinue using if you don't see results immediately. It also might make your acne worse at first before it begins working."

                "I swear by Seventh Generation products, and especially their pads. In fact, it was their pads that made me love their company so much! They are absorbent and comfortable, but the best part about them is that they don't have all of the disgusting chemicals that 99% of pads have. I have very sensitive skin and used to experience a great deal of irritation from the pads I wore as a kid before I learned about what they actually contained. These Seventh Generation pads, on the other hand, give me no irritation whatsoever! They have no chlorine, no dyes, no fragrances (something many of us, myself included, are allergic to)--they're just what you'd want out of a pad! I have been using these for years and years and have never had any complaints about them whatsoever. Seventh Generation's pads come in several sizes, so whatever your needs, you should be able to find what you're looking for! I trust Seventh Generation so much for my sensitive region that I plan on using their diapers when my child arrives, too, because I know they'll be absorbent and safe.",
                "Michael's wife here... i absolutely love this product. i have always used stay free ultra thin with wings, but seeing how i am now vegan and trying to be eco friendly, i am slowing replacing my items as they run out. i have wanted to try this product for some time but have had a stock pile of stay free pads. now that the stock pile has run out, i am able to try and purchase these. i was a little nervous seeing how this would be a new product for me and some of the reviews were saying they were too thin almost like pantyliner. well they are thin like a pantyliner but they work great. I was a little nervous but no accidents and they feel great, i couldn't even tell i had a pad on. it was great. wish i had tried these sooner. i would recommend to anyone who is trying to rid chemicals from their bodies or their child.",
                "I have been an Always users my entire life-- I like the thin pads with the wings especially at night. I was so upset when I found out that Always used pesticides in their cotton, but I knew I had to change products. When I found these I was hopeful that they would be comfortable and as absorbent as my typical brand. These really impressed me! They have a good adhesive so they don't slip even with a lot of activity. The cotton is comfortable and holds in the moisture well. I was worried because I used to use the kind that has the protective mesh to keep the moisture away from your skin, but this worked just as well. They come individually wrapped which I appreciate as well. I will definitely use these again. I'm very happy and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to use a pad for a light to moderate flow. I can't say that I would or would not recommend them for a heavy flow because I didn't use them for that particular function.",
                "UPDATED 2020\nI ran out of the supply I purchased in 2011. The new batch with the light blue wrapper are much less substantial and absorbent. The fabric cover becomes detached from the layers below. They don't trap wetness anymore, my pubes are soaked, and I feel like I'm sitting in a puddle. Sorry to be gross, but I'm so disappointed. I have to change these way more often than before.\n\nFROM 2011\nI never understand why people still buy those bulky puff-pads like my mom first offered me. Those are awful and messy and uncomfortable. Like a charm, these thin little guys wick your mess to the edges, and with the wings, they stay flat and in place the whole time. Some other eco-sensitive pads practically decompose while you wear them, but these hold up like a boss. I typically use 1-3 max per day. I like how they designed the adhesive so you first position the pad, and then you expose the wing adhesive and secure those in place. Very thin, very tidy.",
                "I really like these. They are thin enough that you don't feel like its obvious that its on but yet you are protected. I like that this is a 6 pk as it allows me to bulk buy for my period and then safe money that way. I have not had a leak problem even on my heaviest days. I do wish they were slightly longer as they'd cover more but most of the time its not an issue.",
                "These are super short in length. I thought I had bought the long ones. Other than that these are the best pads!",
                "I will try to avoid TMI, although that may be hard to do in a review of pads.\nI had lots of problems with regular chemical laden pads, and after random swellings, infections, and dryness caused by them decided to look for a more natural solution (that is disposable, and doesn't involve me washing them.)\nEnter Seventh Generation Pads.\nNo more problems, no leaks. I am happy.\nI will mention that there is no scent for these, and due to the natural material used may need to be changed more frequently to avoid odor.\nOther than that which I have not found inconvenient, this is a 5 star solution to your female problems.",
                "These pads work very well. My initial impression was that they were kind of papery and \"clinical\" feeling, but once I used one I felt differently. I would describe them as cloth-like in texture. I have no issues with adhesion in cotton underwear. They are very comfortable (can't even tell I'm wearing a pad) and absorb well. I can't see myself ever going back to the Always brand, which often would irritate my skin after a few hours. These Seventh Generation pads are a great product.",
                "Great simple pads with wings. Holds a lot and I can wear one for hours on a heavy flow. I've been buying this for a long time from Amazon. I'm not sure about the price compared to other retailers. Anyways, I keep buying these and the liners from Amazon. I love knowing that my area is safe with scent free, and natural cotton!",
                "works well & sticks well to cotton undies but not so much to lace. absorbs well without making me burn or itch. they are small so use them on light days or the beginning or end.",
                "It is hard to find a pad without a bunch of irritating chemicals. I love this brand because they are free and clear of chlorine and all cotton. They don't wick as well as the plastic ones, but that is okay with me. My primary issue is that, yes, the pads come in different sizes- but the regular size seems like it would only provide enough coverage for a child.",
                "These are great and feel cleaner than always or kotex. They breathe and seem to wick away moisture from your body. Some ladies have said they dont absorb a lot, and I think thats wrong if you're wearing the correct absorbancy. I wear these as backup and they are amazing. I love that the wings are long enough to touch making it stay in place until its changed, this is drasticly different than the tiny wings on other products. Fantastic and will continue to use them!",
                "The most fantastic thing about these is you don't feel 'wet' like Always and such pads make you feel, especially when it is a hot sweaty day. I HATE THAT FEEL! But the price if you break it down is terrible. I would say they are only for the rich. They truly feel like nothing is there but regular underwear. I'd say these were made by women for women and the others by men.",
                "Pros\n- Reasonable price\n- \"Free of fragrances and dyes and whitened without chemicals containing chlorine\". This is beneficial to me as I seem to have less itching, sensitivity compared to regular pads!\nCons\n- These particular pads are too short for me at night time when sleeping horizontally seems to cause more leakage. There may be another larger size I'm not aware of",
                "Very good standard natural disposable pad. Comfortable, soft, non-allergen/discomfort. Breaks down while wearing faster than non natural pads. Naturacare wears better, but is more expensive than 7th gen.",
                "I bought some pads from the store that were 7th Gen and I thought there were them, however, they are super thin and I wanted thicker ones. I feel like I have to change them every other hour during the heavy part of my period. And unfortunately I feel like a have a million of these that I have to use because I don't want to throw them away nor deal with hassle of returning them. So if you are looking for the thin versions of pads these will be great. The sticky part of the wings also doesn't hold them in place at all.",
                "This product is being reviewed by my wife.\n\n\" I was tired of using the regular pads as they were causing a lot of irritation, friction and resulting soreness to the skin. The feel of plastic was a lot more irritating. Used this product and it does not even feel like I am using a pad. Soft, thin and super absorbent\" definitely recommend to those who have hard time using regular pads like always.",
                "I decided to try this product after reading the Environmental Working Group's warning about the hazards of the plastics and fragrances associated with many other feminine products. In my opinion, these work BETTER than the Always Ultra Thin Pads with Wings that I used for over 10 years. These pads absorb better and are more comfortable. THANK YOU for an excellent alternative, Seventh Generation!",
                "Excellent product in all respects. Thank you! Do NOT give my password to anyone else.!! MMQH.\nOR reveal my name to Anyone again or we are through!! I do NOT appreciate this!! MMQH",
                "No itchy/irritating chemicals in these pads. They are super comfortable and appropriately absorbent. I feel so much better about using chemical-free products on my body. I highly recommend them, especially if you experience irritation from big name brand pads!"

For getting those cobwebs in the corners and up along the sides of my apartment building it worked great! Originally was buying one for my neighbor, but saw the price was so low and extended so long and how strong does it have to be for some cobwebs? So I got one for myself as well. Extends quite a bit. Not meant for heavy scrubbing at a distance. That's just silly, and people that leave negative reviews for giving this a hard workout extended to scrub at things, like it's for industrial use, need to get a brain. Very happy with my purchases.",

My two concerns are the handle is not the most comfortable to use if you are dusting for an extended period of time and the instructions are not very helpful for cleaning options of the duster. As a consumer using this product I recommend wearing safety eyewear and a mask, especially if outside and moving dusty items. My opinion two manageable issues.",

When my wife and I first purchased our home, I swear our shed was the spider headquarters for our neighborhood... It was bad... I turned that shed into a water park with how much insect killer I sprayed... Once everything was dry, I went in with my handy dandy cobweb clearer and cleaned house! Well, cleaned shed... It worked like a charm! I can now walk into my shed without feeling like someone just put my moms old stretched out nylons over my face! Lifesaver!",

It feels more like cheap kids\u2019 Pom-poms. What\u2019s worst, is that even after a thorough cleaning with mild dish soap, this duster ATTRACTS GLOBS OF DUST THEN REPELS THEM BACK ONTO MY FURNITURE!! I\u2019ve never experienced anything like this with a static duster. This thing is getting returned immediately."

                "I've read some reviews on here about how this didn't do anything and/or the smell was bad and lingered.\nI'll start by saying that they must have either gotten a bad batch, ranging in really strong smell and/or it was an old batch that was\nleft to linger. Either way the ones I got are perfect. The smell is not strong (I should know. My mother has this coconut butter perfume that is stupid strong and I can't stand it. This is weak in smell compared to that.) and it's done wonders on my hair. I know this because I bought this specifically because I was going to bleach my hair and needed a deep conditioner and it works.\n\nI had to bleach my hair twice and I have since used this conditioner (no shampoo after bleaching) and left it in the 3 minutes, maybe more, to have my hair come out silky smooth. That's saying a lot from me, because I have naturally curly, thick hair. I'm mixed so I've got my fathers hair more than my mom's, but this did what it was suppose to do. It kept my hair from feeling like straw (as it would after bleaching) and it's even worked on the tips of my hair which were really fried after the 2 bleaching sessions. Keep in mind that I shower in the morning and at night (I only wash my hair 1 day out of the week. When not bleached.) and was using this each time as I wanted to strengthen my hair again before I tone it.\n\nAnyways, it does what I need it to do. Keep my hair from looking like a straw man's head!",
                "I just moved to North Dakota where it is so extremely windy, cold, and dry and my hair is showing it dramatically. I have spent probably $150+ on deep conditioners, oils, masks, anything I could find to keep my hair from being so brittle and breaking, not just at the ends, but even half way up the strand. My boyfriend brought this home off of the clearance rack at Walmart and my hair has never been softer since I moved up here. I wash my hair between 1-2 times a week and I use about a palms worth of this each time. In a different climate, it would probably make my hair greasy, but it has been a life saver up here. I only gave it 4 stars because while this is the best my hair has looked while up here, it's certainly not the forever solution I'm looking for since my hair is still dry, just not nearly as dry as it was!",
                "I bought this product after reading raving reviews about it online, watching videos and everything from almost every beauty and hair care blog and website out there. They were all saying how perfect this is, because it smells good, because it's so simple and quick, and especially because it's so affordable.\nThat is why I immediately jumped and bought myself a pack of 4 instead of trying just one. Well, that was a bit of a rash decision; the product isn't bad. It really works very well with my hair and with all kinds of hair, it really costs a fraction of the price of most other masks and it's so simple and fast, it's amazing. The smell, however, is a bit of a problem for me.\nI couldn't pinpoint the smell, it felt like it was changing, constantly.\nIn a nutshell, the scent reminded me of one of those bottles of perfume there are for younger girls who want to feel like adults. You know, the colorful bottles, smaller ones, made for tweens, early teens, those bottles that sit next to the glitter body lotions and stuff. Those things have a very strong sweet scent, and that's what this smells like.\nIt felt like I was rubbing candy in my hair, and I didn't like it at all. It's very very strong.\n\nIf you like sweet scents or if you don't mind, I really recommend this from the bottom of my heart.\nIf you're more sensitive to that type of thing, I would steer clear of this product.",
                "I can not tell you how well this works, you'll just have to try it!! But I can tell you that this stuff is a miracle in a freakin bottle. My hand is thick, like my pony tail is literally an inch, around mid tail, but the strands are fine and I die it, flat iron, and blow dry it every night, so it was starting to feel like hay, just so dry and brittle. I used this the first time, and I noticed a slight difference, but nothing to drastic, but I decided to keep trying, and the second time, my split ends were no longer split and my hay hair felt like crushed silk. By the third use my hair was falling in russet waves with no damage and I was tearing up it looked so good. I haven't had hair like this since I was little, and my boyfriend even said something. (This is the same guy who doesn't even notice when I get my hair cut or colored.)He kept messing with it, I finally had to tell him to stop because it was getting annoying. This stuff is worth its weight in platinum. If you are tired of dealing with hay hair, and nothing seems to be working, give this stuff a go. Its cheaper than most remedies and it smells SO GOOD!! You'll love it, and I'll be your hair will soak it up like sunshine!!",

I always thought I'd have to spend a lot of money for something great, but on a whim I bought this because, honestly, I needed to meet my amount for the prime free shipping.\n\nOccasionally though I'll substitute this with the more expensive It's a Miracle 10. But that's because I bought a 32oz and it's lasting me forever and impossible to finish, haha.\n\nFor the price, this conditioner is a steal. After shampooing and rinsing my hair, I'll apply the conditioner and leave on for a few minutes. I've noticed though that if I keep it on my scalp as well, it'll make my head a bit oily as the day goes on. So I usually just concentrate it on my hair past my head and all is good. I love how it gives weight to my hair strands so that they don't feel brittle and fizzes away in the wind.",
                "I've been using this since 2010 with positive results of hydration, softness, silkiness and shine. There's a pleasant slight coconut fragrance. My dyed and hot-tooled hair gets a refreshing, moisturizing reprieve from this economical deep conditioner once a week. Using it too frequently causes my scalp to have build up and become itchy. Often I'll use it while having a hot cup of tea, leaving it on more than 3 minutes in a plastic shower cap or one for processing; uplifting for hair and spirit.\n\nThe formulation has changed AGAIN since the original. It does seem thicker and rinses cleaner with less residue. It's not as good as the ORIGINAL in the blah cream colored bottle and formulation that conditioned, moisturized and strengthened the hair, but it's very close.\n\nI recommend it.",
                "This deep conditioner is really good. I understand a lot of naturals may not rate it very high because its not considered sulfate and paraben free. however, this works wonders on softening and conditioning my hair. I use it in between regular heat deep conditioning because I work out a lot and co-wash and shampoo my hair more than normal. This is one of my staples and has been a contributing factor to the health and growth of my hair. I've purchased the four pack before and plan to continue as long as it works for me. It may not work for everyone, as we each respond differently to products based on our hair texture, porosity and other factors, not because someone says so. Try it and make your own informed decision.",

In fact, when I was a kid, I spent a long time in a hot tub that, apparently, had just been shocked with way too much bleach, and my hair dried out so badly that I was considering a drastic hair cut. Like, I could hold it by the roots and all two feet of it would stand out straight! I spent weeks using home remedies and products to try to fix the damage, and nothing worked. My mom had some 3 Minute Miracle, and she said if THIS doesn't work, we'll just have to cut my hair short. I used this ONCE and my hair was back to normal! It's been over 10 years since the Hot Tub incident, and I still keep this stuff as a staple.",

So I've long looked for a product that will help my situation. This really hydrated my hair well and smells really good. I use it once to twice a week to help my hair with its dry and brittle tendencies.\n\nHowever, there are some cons.\n**NOTE THAT THIS IS FROM THE EXPERIENCE FROM MY HAIR AND DOES NOT NECESSARILY APPLY TO EVERYONE**\n- Because of how dry my hair is, I have to leave it on much longer than its supposed \"3 minutes miracle\" (5-10 mins/ more on extremely dry days)\n- Have to use a lot to fully hydrate the hair thoroughly\n- Have to follow with the aussie leave-in conditioning spray to fully hydrate",

Some one left a bottle at my house by accident, didnt need it back, so I plopped it on, not expecting much. That was 5 years ago, at least. I buy it in bulk. If anyone knows of a conditioner that gets tangles out as easily as this cheap stuff does, I am always willing to try it, but nothing in my opinion comes close to this. Really.",

I've tried many upscale & salon brand conditioners over the years, but always go back to this stuff. It really is a bit of a \"miracle.\" You can feel split rough ends (from heat styling, etc.) resolve in the time it sits on your locks. As you rinse, smoothness reigns again.\n\nGive it a try & you, too will be buying the 4-packs & 6-packs offered here on Amazon.",
                "I have used this conditioner for about 3 months now after switching from Infusium 23 Moisture brand. I like this conditioner a lot better. My hair is fairly curly and has some frizz to it so I was looking for something that would help weigh it down. This does just that, after the 3 minute wait, the conditioner rinses with no oily or other residue. After drying and applying some other leave in product my hair feels and looks great. After using this I use less of my leave in product, and it seems to thicken and weigh my hair a little which gives me a better handle on the curls. Highly recommended!",

I don't know why I stray...why I imagine that there's anything better, I should know by now that there isn't. And you sure can't beat the price. It makes my hair soft and silky, without weighing it down. It's worth the three minutes!",

In just 3 minutes my hair had so much more moisture. It was incredible. I bought the 3-pack of this and I am so glad I did. This along with a few other Aussie products I've ordered (Hair Insurance Split End Protector; Smooth N' Bloom Conditioner) has improved the health of my hair tremendously.\n\nI absolutely ADORE this product and WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE. It's a real life saver. You have to try it to believe!",

I bought the four pack and will again as soon as I run out. It surprisingly lasts a long time even though I have thick, long hair and use globs of the stuff!",
                "I am relaxed and have been on my healthy hair journey about 18 months now. Although I have solidifed most of my staple products I have never been happy with any of my conditioners ranging from both high end and low end products. Aussie is my new staple. I love how thick it is, and I love how moisturized my hair feels after just 3 min. I leave it on a little bit longer as I do my other shower rituals and my hair loves it! Detangling is a cinch! I dont really care for how the bottle is made, but not a huge deterrance for me. This product is a welcomed staple in my reggie!",
                "After years of torturing my hair with chemicals, I didn't know what to do with my hair. I accepted it's fate as a dry, frizzy exchange for a broom. Then suddenly I tried this product....\n\nMy hair started singing! Okay maybe not literally. But after the first use my hair felt so moisturized and bouncy, I finally achieved that mermaid look you get from spending a day at the beach.... without going to the beach.\n\nAll my life people commented on how frizzy my hair was... but for the first time someone actually remarked on how healthy it looks. I am sold on this product for life. I'm never using any other conditioner again!",
                "I'm a guy and I've been using this conditioner for years now, still giving me the results from day one: soft and silky hair! This is perfect for a daily conditioner and works as a hair mask if you leave it in longer. I usually leave it in for 10-15 minutes once and a week and then 3 as described on the product for everyday use.\n\nI use a lot of heat tools on my hair so this is perfect if you need a lot of moisture in your hair!",
                "This is a GREAT product especially for those of us who work in chlorinated pools. If you use enough of the product after every time you are in the pool, it will protect your hair and keep it in great shape. Those who cut my hair always comment on how wonderfully my hair looks and feels. I've been using this for over 5 years and I love it! Being able to buy it in bulk is a real boon as the product is not always available in the store when I need it. Plus... there is a slight savings.",
                "I have been a long time believer in this product, I have very long natural virgin hair and it still tends to get dry from heat due to blow drying and styling.\n\nThe Cons:\nNot enough in bottle\nCan leave hair heavy and oily if to much is used\n\nPros:\nLeaves hair shiny, moisturized and bouncy cutting down on damage\nSmells like coconuts\n\nI would recommend this product to anyone, and the price of this works amazing I like this so much more than the salon products I have tried."

I found out later I huniated the disc. So, be careful - this can hide the warning pain.\n\nThe second time I used it, sleeping in a cheap mattress for a few weeks. Was in so much pain I couldn't do anything else but mange the pain. Within a week I tried other patches, creams (even icy hot cream), products). They didn't make the pain bearable.

I usually go to my Acupuncturist but obviously that is not happening at the moment. So, I decided to give these patches a try. I am impressed!! Works for about 6-8 hours. This is going to have to hold me over until my Acupuncturist opens up for business again. I would definitely purchase again.",
                "I bought these as a means to try to alleviate the horrible pain in both of my lower legs from some nasty shin splints (I've recently gotten into running. Word to the wise: if you have shin splints, stop running until they're healed as continuing to do so is only going to increase your healing time, do more damage, and cause you ridiculous amounts of pain.) I love that these last 8 hours so I can put them on and then forget about them for the next 8 hours. They truly are the only thing that has worked to help with the pain and, with them being so long, they stretch from just below my knee to just above my ankle thus covering the entire area I need to cover. Thank you Icy Hot! Without you I would be absolutely useless until these blasted shin splints heal.",

I use these for back pain which has gone on too long and make the pain bearable! Will never go w/o at least a box in my house\nMishelle",

Can feel the effects for at least a few hours. Sometimes also wear one to bed on a bad night.\n\nBeware the resealable bag is flaky. My first package dried out, and now I keep them in my own plastic baggie so that they stay moist.",

                "Beware! These patches go on very cold (that\u2019s the \u201cicy\u201d). But, once they are on they are very comfortable to walk around with or sleep with. I wouldn\u2019t recommend wearing them in public due to the strong smell.",
                "They last about 12 hours per. When I have sinus difficulties or a cold I will cut them down (to about 1/3\" and put them where my sinuses are and between the heat & menthol - they become open and clear. Do not put directly on the soft tissue under your eye. Putting them on the cheekbone under that soft eye tissue works great.",

I loathe the taste of pepto in any form so these are the only way I get relief. Seriously, the dissolvable or chewable forms are so unpleasant to me they Make me gag! Obviously I won\u2019t even try the liquid. The pepto caplets are extremely difficult t find any where, I can find the liquid and the chewable but no place has the caplets since 2021. I bought a generic brand caplets and they also were fine, but no longer in stock. So Amazon had them and I\u2019m thankful to find them.",

But I can only give 'em 4.\n\nMom takes 2 caplets, 3 times a day, and then she's good. Only problem is that the surface of the Pepto caplets aren't glossy-smooth. I think they could be used as a small pink chalk for a blackboard or sidewalk. Their surface is rough enough to give Mom significant trouble swallowing them.\n\nBut she says she'd rather have the challenge of occasionally gagging on the caplets rather than chew up tablets or drink the liquid.\n\nI don't know why Pepto can't provide a tab or cap with a smooth surface. If I can find all the necessary dimensions on the internet, I will pursue purchasing gelatin capsules into which I can place the caplets. Ma will have a much easier time with the smooth surface of a capsule. I don't know what took me so long to think of it.",

                "Because of my IBS I have a lot of runny dumps. Sometimes it comes on so fast that I go from no feelings at all to \"panic mode\" and need to find a bathroom RIGHT NOW in a period of less than five minutes. It's really a bummer. (See what I did there?).\nWhen I was younger I could eat just about whatever I wanted without trouble. Now I just look at pizza and I can feel diarrhea forming in my intestines. If trouble sets in, I can basically plan for five or six trips on the porcelain bus over the next two hours, each time just completely painting the bowl.\nBy the time the runny dumps set in, it's basically too late for Pepto. But often I'll make a preemptive strike against my colon and throw a few of these pills back either right before or right after I eat and it seems to help. I get the 'rrhea less frequently than usual with this method.\nThe down side is that these little pink critters really taste foul, like swallowing angry chalk after it's been used to write racial epithets on the sidewalk in front of a Trump rally. But that's a small price to pay for not making doody in my shorts.\nI like that Amazon sells these in a multi-pack. Whenever I buy 3 or 4 boxes at Target, the cashier looks at me like I have a problem. But let's face it\u2026I do.",
                "Well, the title really says it all. Just a quick travel tip - I took 3 bottles of this on a recent trip to India to take as a preventative measure and I am so glad I did. I have never taken pepto before and didn't know if it would do anything, but it definitely helped.\n\nWe took 1 capsule (1/2 adult amount) before every meal or snack, and man, we were not being overly cautious about where we ate - street food, raw juice, karah parshad at a small-town gurudwara...and no crazy travel stomach stories that you often hear. Granted, you never fully have your proper appetite, but no one had to rush to the bathroom at a truly inopportune time, and we got to be much more adventurous eaters. A low-grade of nausea but still being able to sight-see is far better than the bathroom horror stories I heard of before my trip.\n\nDisclaimer - this stuff will make your poops weirdly dark and have an odd consistency, but hey... those street samosas are worth it.\n\nThe practical: The capsules are unflavored but hard to dry-swallow, so make sure you have bottled/trusted water with you at all times!",
                "If you're looking for a way to settle your stomach without the need to manage a liquid, these are definitely for you. I bought these so I could have something to help with any tummy troubles I may have, and I can say that they work. They're pretty much tasteless when compared to the liquid, so if you don't like the taste of the liquid, you could try these and see if it helps any. Even chewing them shows little flavor in comparison. They're pretty soft, so I don't think taking them with a fluid is necessary, but it's definitely recommended if you wish to avoid a chalky powder being left in your mouth...",

Pepto is your reliable friend who is always there for you after you emerge from the bathroom after a fierce battle. He doesn't care how bad it was, how long you were in there, or the things that happened that can't be unseen, all he wants to do is help you feel better.\n\nI really like these Pepto pills because you can swallow them instead of taking a chewable tablet that turns your tongue black or holding your breath while you down a chalky shot of the liquid version. Thanks to the magic of efficient packaging, the pills all arrived unscathed and ready for battle. I was a longtime chewable user, but these pills converted me to the pill side.",
                "I took this for years growing up and then when Imodium AD came out over the counter, I switched but it always gave me stomach pain and then there was the idea to not take anti-diarrheals in case it was food poisoning.\n\nAnd then I discovered something about Pepto Bismol that changed everything; that this medicine binds to E-Coli and rids this bacteria from your body. And this medicine was originally an infant cholera treatment.\n\nSo I am back to Pepto Bismol and I'm finding it has helped me with not just diarrhea but heartburn, gas and helps me go to sleep when stomach discomfort was keeping me up.\n\nI never was a fan of the liquid and I hated the chewables so the caplets are perfect and much cheaper here than at the store.",
                "I mean what is there to say. It's pepto, its the best working stomach medicine on the market. Covers any base you might need. I always have a bottle on me or near me. Stuff is wonderful. I do not know why it asked me to review the flavor, these are pills and chalky pills at that. The flavor is abysmal, but if you're taking a pill right you shouldn't be licking/tasting it.",
                "My mother loves the caplets...hates to chew pills! Just as effective as chewable or liquid. Easy to transport when she travels.",
                "I have several abdominal issues that require me to take this product often. It's very affordable and always has been available which is a comfort."

                "We are BIG into natural living, so I was NOT one who wanted to whiten our teeth using unsafe ingredients. The ingredients in these are overall pretty decent, EXCEPT the SACCHARIN.\n\nThat said, we had a dentist recommend we whiten one of our teen's teeth BEFORE braces because they said if we whiten AFTER braces, they would have to REMOVE & REPLACE any fillings in the teen's teeth because the fillings would be the color of her teeth that were stained from silent reflux due to hiatal hernia issues caused by a tongue tie, as well as her lips & buccals were also tied, causing the dental issues.\n\nWe did NOT want to have to have her fillings redone for several reasons, so we decided to try the home whitening. I was NOT happy that there is saccharin in them as it is TOXIC, but I felt I had to compromise because I felt 14 days of saccharin on her teeth for 30 minutes, would be less harmful than having to replace the fillings that would be in her mouth for several years, not to mention that every time a filling is redone, part of the natural tooth structure is removed even further, & we felt that was the greater risk long term.\n\nAfter reading countless reviews on several listings for the Crest strips, I decided upon these ones. I saw \"professional\" ones that were pricier & I was going to buy them, UNTIL I saw the reviews that said the strips were dried out, the boxes came empty, etc. I also considered the ones for SENSITIVE teeth, but was concerned they would not whiten quickly enough, as some reviewers had stated. These ones said \"professional effect\" so I decided I would go for it after reading the reviews.\n\nWe are SO happy with them!\n\nOur teen used these for 14 days, 30 minutes each time, daily. She brushed her teeth before (she did not see the note on the box that says to avoid brushing right before) & rinsed with a Waterpik after to get the stuff off her teeth thoroughly.\n\nWe were THRILLED that when she went for a filling on day 14 to repair some damage due to the ties & using straight charcoal powder on her teeth (UNBEKNOWNST to me!), her teeth were as white as they could be (B2) without heavy duty professional whitening. The DENTIST was VERY happy with the results as well.\n\nWe are VERY pleased & did not realize how much the silent reflux (which we did not know was happening) had impacted the color of her teeth. Her teeth are SO white now & ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!\n\nWe are now going to buy strips for our other teens & tween to use, because they also had silent reflux until they had their unknown tongue, lip, & buccal ties released recently. Their teeth are nowhere near as stained & our one teen's were, so I am not sure if their teeth will be as white as our one daughter's are after using these strips, but I want to let them try.\n\nOur teen is SO much more CONFIDENT now & smiles SO much. She was NEVER bothered by her teeth before, but I think that now seeing them look so absolutely BEAUTIFUL, has helped her teeth to look as great as she now feels after having her ties released, & her airway expansion in progress. Had I known her teeth were so stained, I would have used these sooner.\n\nAfter I get my kids' teeth done with these strips, I may splurge on some for me too.\n\nI WOULD purchase these again & have purchased them for my other kids now.",
                "If I use more than once a week my teeth become sensitive.",
                "As a person that consumes large amounts of coffee and tea, keeping my teeth white has been an ongoing struggle that has prompted me to buy just about every whitening product available. Every time Crest comes out with a new Whitestrips product I give it a try. Many have been disappointing, and all have proven to be a somewhat unpleasant chore to use. Now I understand that doing something to make your teeth whiter is worth some time and effort, but using the Crest Whitestrips is usually a messy, uncomfortable process that I have always dreaded. Still, I have always been able to get noticeable results so I continue to use them nonetheless. Until recently I was getting the best results from using the Crest Whitestrips Pro Effects 10-day System. However, those strips still tended to slide around on my teeth and required that I keep my mouth closed for the entire treatment.\n\nIn February I was given the opportunity to try the new Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips kit. It is certainly a big improvement over the other Whitestrips products. The Advanced Seal kit only requires a 30 minute treatment once a day, whereas the rest of the Whitestrips product line requires two 30 minute treatments each day. The entire kit lasts for 14 days, but it promises that you will see results within 3 days. The kit contains 14 packets, each packet containing an upper and lower whitening strip. Each strip is coated with a peroxide-infused gel, which is claimed to mold and adhere to teeth better that any previous Whitestrips product. Crest also notes that this product will only work on natural teeth, and will NOT whiten caps, crowns, veneers, fillings, or dentures. These Whitestrips should not be used by anyone under the age of 12, and should not be used on teeth with braces. Crest even claims that you can drink water while whitening your teeth with this product.\n\nHere is the 3-step method for using this product (taken directly from the Crest website):\n\n1. Peel:\n- For best results, do not brush teeth immediately before applying strips.\n- Open foil pouch and remove.\n- Peel strips from backing.\n2. Apply:\n- Apply gel side of strip to teeth. It will instantly mold and adhere to teeth.\n- Align strips with gum line and press gently for good contact.\n- Fold the rest of strip behind teeth to keep in place.\n3. Reveal:\n- Wear strips for 30 minutes once a day, remove and discard.\n- Crest Whitestrips Advanced Seal comes off cleanly.\n\nAfter using this kit for the full 14 days, here is what I have personally experienced:\n\nFirst of all, the claim by Crest that these strips hold much better to your teeth is true. In fact, when trying to remove these strips some may feel that they hold TOO good. I have found that removing them can be a somewhat difficult and messy task. After being in your mouth for 30 minutes the strips are rather slimy and slippery, so I have learned to pull one end loose and then use a tissue to pull the strip off my teeth. You really have to tug pretty hard in order to get these strips off from your teeth! Second, the strips still leave some unpleasant residue on your teeth, so you will want to make sure to brush right after removing the strips. Third, the strips are still a little bit of a pain to apply. It's hard to fold them over your teeth without getting creases in them. But, the fact that they hold strong is a great thing. They hold on tight for the full 30 minutes, and therefore don't slide around on your teeth like the previous Whitestrips did. I don't experience the excessive amount of saliva generated by the previous Whitestrips products either. Although some folks do experience a mild amount of increased sensitivity after repeated use of this product, I was able to complete the full 14 treatments (without skipping a day) without any discomfort whatsoever. These Advanced Seal Whitestrips are a great improvement in design, and they are ultimately much easier to use. I definitely notice that my teeth appear whiter within 2 to 3 treatments, and by the end of the 14-day treatment my teeth looked wonderfully bright.\n\nOverall I am very pleased with the improved design and excellent results provided by the Crest Advanced Seal Whitestrips product. They're not completely perfect, and they are still a bit of a chore to apply, use, and remove. But when all is said and done these strips are definitely the best effort produced by Crest yet. If you are looking for whiter, brighter teeth, and don't mind a 30 (35 minutes including removal and brushing afterward) minute inconvenience for 14 days, I highly recommend the Advanced Seal Whitestrips system from Crest. Shop around though, because they can be found much cheaper on the Internet than in local retail stores. I have found them nearly twenty dollars cheaper on sites like Amazon than what they sell for in brick and mortar stores. In these tough economic times it is always good to save a few bucks whenever possible. After all, paying more for the same product is not going to get your teeth any whiter. =o)",
                "Excellent purchase!!",
                "After completing the treatment I felt like they did whiten my teeth a lot. However, I would look at myself in different mirrors and lightning and not see the results as much. I do believe they work but I also have a couple of stains from when I had braces that did not go away. In my case, I am going to need a professional whitening treatment to achieve the results that I want.",
                "These work well",
                "Teeth Whitening, easy to use...",
                "Being a true Brit I have (had) quite yellow, stained teeth. One of my front teeth is a little crooked and I\u2019m not a big fan of braces to fix something so minor, but a few years ago a friend suggested that whitening my teeth would make the wonky tooth look less weird. In my teen years I tried lots of cheap messy gel products from eBay and none of them had any qualities that made me want to continue use, least of all any whitening effect.\n\nRoll on a few years later; I\u2019m in my late twenties, a mother and looking to step up my career a little. I look in the mirror and I\u2019m happy, but I could tweak a few things and feel 10x better about \u2018Me\u2019. So with this time money being only a small factor in my endeavours, I decided to do some research on whitening procedures offered by Dentists in the UK. After a few weeks of comparisons and consulting forum after forum online I came to the conclusion that going down the bonafide dentist route would be more costly than expected and no guarantee I wouldn\u2019t be in sensitive agony.\n\nBut, Crest Whitestrips seemed to be the next best thing. Only downside is you can\u2019t get them in the UK. Good job that Amazon.COM will ship to my UK address \u2013 Awesome!\n\nHaving read up a lot on how to combat the sensitivity issues I took the initiative to purchase some sensitive toothpaste and mouthwash to start using prior to picking a whitening treatment. The more I could do to prevent sensitivity the better. I began the strict regime of twice daily brushing, flossing in the evening and mouthwash about 4 weeks before I put anything on my teeth. Bear in mind that I was a brush once a day gal before I started this and a lot of my back teeth have amalgam fillings. I even have a filling in the back of my front tooth, I was not kind to my mouth at all!\n\nI ordered a sample kit from a UK based website initially before taking the plunge on a full 14 treatment pack from Amazon.com. I got 7 treatments of the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 variety and figured I\u2019d see if I liked those first.\n\nI saw results after the first 2 strips. It was amazing. They stuck to my teeth so well and gave full coverage for my smile. Because of this I purchased a 14 pack of the \u2018Glamorous White\u2019 variety and followed the tracked package from the USA, to the UK, through Customs and to my door. It arrived 1 week earlier than expected. Happy days.\n\nSo I\u2019d used up my 7 \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 and began on the \u2018Glamorous White\u2019 as soon as they arrived. They stick to your teeth beautifully, though in the instructions it doesn\u2019t tell you to dry your teeth, I always find they adhere a lot better if you do. Sitting for 30 minutes with them in your face is a breeze, I tend to do housework or sit down for half an episode of Scandal\u2026..usual mummy things.\n\nThe picture attached to my review speaks for itself, this is from before using 7 \u2018PE\u2019 strips and then 7 Glamorous White strips (half of my purchase from here). My results have been fantastic, and in only ten days! And ZERO SENSITIVITY! *high five*. And I\u2019ve got another 7 treatments to go if I want to, or save them for top ups.\n\nI\u2019ve marked this item as 4 out of 5 because it misses the direction of drying your teeth before applying them, there is some confusion around how many times you can have a treatment per day and because the bottom strip is a lot smaller than the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 version. The \u2018PE\u2019 ones cover my whole bottom smile which is about 8 teeth left to right. With this one I get just about coverage for 6 so if I\u2019m honest I wouldn\u2019t buy these again purely for that reason.\n\nIn terms of daily application I go with two as the maximum, not because I have any sensitivity but just because an hour of my day is all I\u2019m prepared to give up to this at the moment.\n\nI\u2019m at the stage where I want to get to a satisfactory white and then just maintain it from there. I\u2019m confident I can do that using Crest products, but it will most likely be the \u2018Professional Effects\u2019 as overall I find them to be the superior version.",

                "I will start by saying that although I was expecting some sensitivity issues (I read a lot of reviews...) there has been none until now. I did start brushing with Sensodyne Rapid about two weeks before starting the white strips, and I continue to brush with it right after I remove the strips. I have also been using Sensodyne Protect & Repair with Novamin. I just removed my 4th pair of strips and to be honest I don't see a difference... My teeth are still as yellow as before. I don't smoke or drink coffee/wine, so I guess it's just the quality of my enamel. I really was not expecting a drastic change, but after 4 treatments I thought there would be a little improvement.... I don't know, should I still be hopeful? Now, about the infamous bottom strip: dear sirs at Crest, the bottom strip in the Advanced Vivid is ridiculously small! I mean, seriously, who wants to have six beautiful whitened teeth sitting right next to two or three yellow ones?? It shows! No one has such a small mouth. I had to use one packet of strips just to cut into pieces so I could cover the other teeth, which in my case are the darker ones. So, I'm already down one treatment. Other than that, the advanced seal works very well, the strips are easy to apply and remove and leave no taste in my mouth. No sensitivity in the gums either. Now my question is what white strips version should I try in case these do not work at all, and how long should I wait inbetween treatments? I would really like to get rid of some of this yellowing... Can you help me Crest? I will come back and update this review towards the end of the treatment. Keeping my fingers crossed!\n\nEdit\nDay 5: I left the strips on for one hour this time, although it is not recommended and Crest does say the product won't whiten past the recommended time. Sure enough I still can't see any real change in shade. The teeth look whiter right after I remove the strips, but after a few seconds the color is back to normal. I did experience a few twinges on my teeth about 8 to 10 hours after this treatment, nothing painful, just weird. I guess leaving the strips for longer than recommended does improve your chances of getting sensitivity. Still not impressed.\n\nEdit\nDay 6: this time I went back to the recommended 30 minutes routine and the slight sensitivity didn't come back. I have finally started to notice a difference in teeth shade, they are not much whiter (maybe one shade whiter) but they are definitely brighter! Also I went to the dentist and had them professionally cleaned, I hope that helps a little with the process.\n\nEdit\nResults! I can now say that my teeth are much whiter and I am so pleased! Still a few days to go so it can only get better. It took me about six days to really start seeing a difference but these actually really work, it's worth the wait. I'm rating these strips 4 stars just because of the size of the bottom strip. Other than that they work great and gave me no pain or discomfort.",
                "so I never had whitened my teeth before (other that the 4 times I used a charcoal activating toothpaste) and I thought this would be a scam, but my brother had some yellow teeth and then he surprised me one day with a white smile. For him, this would be worth the 5 stars! I was blown away but I still didn't try it. I kept putting it off but I wish I had done it sooner.\n\nMy teeth were off white. I don't smoke, but I think drinking coffee and skipping out on flossing caught up with me that there was a slight yellowish tint in some lighting but it was only noticeable to me. I have small teeth and big cheeks so usually when I smile and talk you only see my top teeth, which is good because I have a chipped tooth at the bottom.\nAnyway, I am graduating college soon and had to take some pictures so I finally remembered that I wanted to give this a try.\nI feel more confident when I smile now but here's the issue.\nThe bottom strip is not the same size as the top strip so the bottom strip did not give as great of coverage as the top strip. It also slipped off; whereas, the top strip was perfect at sticking on to your teeth. Crest should consider just giving 2 top strips and I'm surprised they have not done so seeing how people have been making this complaint for over a decade.\nThe change on my teeth were not as dramatic a change as my brother's. I was hoping it would be lifted 2 more shades but still I am very impressed with my top teeth. My bottom teeth kinda look the same from day 1.\nIt is still well worth the $ to feel confident when you smile.\nI plan on buying them again in a few months. Also most days I did not get a zing sensation (you get it from having sensitive teeth) but the days that I left the strips on for too long I did feel it. If I felt a zing, I'd wait a few days before putting in the next strip.\n\nI took some pictures of my teeth to show the transformation. I think the teeth look really good in sunlight but under certain lighting like white lights- not as great. if you are debating this, don't overthink it. Give it a try! :D",
                "these were my first experience with teeth whitening strips and i think they\u2019re pretty good. they make my teeth a little sensitive but they do whiten quite nicely. the taste is bad though it\u2019s not intense but it\u2019s definitely not what i especially, like it kinda tastes dangerous but i haven\u2019t experienced any poor health from it.",
                "I love using these!\nOkay, so lots of people have commented on how these can increase your sense of sensitivity and it has a nasty taste in your mouth--I'm going to be honest: I don't really taste anything. It says not to swallow anything so maybe someone accidentally swallowed some and it was gross? Idk. And as far as sensitivity goes, I have sensitive teeth anyways so I was SUPER nervous about using these but I took a risk, and I've continued using my normal toothpaste: Crest's Whitening Therapy toothpaste that also helps majorly with sensitivity. I don't know if it is the toothpaste that helps but I haven't felt an increase in sensitivity. :)\nIf you have problems with sensitivity but want to whiten your smile, my Dentist told me (I had previously asked for advice on using these strips) to decrease how often you leave them on and for how long. If you feel any weird tingling or pain while the strips are on after a bit, take them off and try again the next day or the next. Totally up to you how long you use it. JUST DON'T FALL ASLEEP WITH IT IN!! I don't know what happens but it's all over the instructions as a warning. haha\nAlso another thing, in the instructions (You can tell I was worried about using these haha) it mentioned to avoid brushing your teeth right before you use the strips. It didn't explain why so I either just do it at the end of the day or wait a while after brushing my teeth, like 30 minutes to an hour if you can. And I always brush my teeth after-cuz the whitening gel is all over your teeth and it feels gross and weird so I rinse first and then brush my teeth after a few minutes--I don't want to immediately brush off what I want to whiten my teeth!\nAnd I know everyone's been putting up BEFORE and AFTER photos of their teeth. Well I totally blew it I didn't take a before picture... But I'm getting married in June so the real test is if my smile will match my dress!! *Fingers crossed!!*\nGood luck on your adventures!\n\nOH I ALMOST FORGOT!\nSo children: It disclaims in the package instructions that white spots could appear or stains on your teeth could brighten temporarily.\nLet me emphasis the word: TEMPORARILY. TEMPORARILY. I have small lines on my teeth from braces (I wasn't a diligent brusher at 12 years old) and they brightened for like a day. I used it again (I do every other day) and they weren't as bright. So DO NOT WORRY if you experience similar results. Keep calm and keep on whitening. :)",
                "These strips have definitely whitened my teeth. My wife and other members of my family all use them too.",
                "YOU SHOULD TOTALLY BUY THESE WHITESTRIPS IF YOU REALLY WANT WHITER TEETH. Don't whine about sensitivity, it says right on the box that it can happen. I had no issue with the \"goo\" on these bleaching my clothes or fingers. They only became gooey when I removed them from my teeth.\n\nI had been thinking about whitening my teeth for awhile -- I had the Rembrandt 2-Hour Whitening kit, but that thing TORE MY GUMS UP. It did whiten my teeth slightly though, but not worth the $50 and the pain. I asked my dentist about getting professional whitening, but he said it's basically the same thing as everything out on the market that has a tray (like the rembrandt kit), just wildly more expensive (I love his honesty).\n\nI had the old whitestrips from about 3 years ago -- they didn't do too much for me. I got this new set of Crest Whitestrips in a fit of optimism. The shipping took a little longer than most stuff I get from Amazon, but nothing outrageous. The packaging was nothing to hoot at (mine came wrapped in the Classifieds section in a manila envelope, the box was a little crushed, but the innards were fine).\n\nI read the instructions, and DID NOT brush my teeth beforehand, and slapped those suckers onto my lower and upper teeth. I like these better than the old whitestrips, they aren't gooey and slippery like the old ones. They're more a tacky feel, like they get sticky only when they get wet, so you can readjust them without them sliding all over your mouth. I do have a fairly wide smile, and the upper strips cover just about all of it, and the lower ones cover about 6 of my teeth. These don't taste as bleachy as the old ones, and they didn't irritate my gums AT ALL either.\n\nI've been using them every other day to cut back on the risk of sensitivity (but I fell asleep with them on one day, which you're NOT supposed to do - so i ended up leaving em on for like 2 hours instead of just 30 minutes, so I had some sensitivity after that session that faded eventually). I noticed a visible difference in the shade of my teeth within 3-4 treatments and I think i still have about 5 packets left. My teeth are pretty white now, but not unnaturally white (by unnatural, i mean like Ross in that episode of Friends where he dates the girl with the blacklight). My teeth aren't paper-white, but let's be honest -- that would be creepy. The walls at my job are a pale cream color, and my teeth are now whiter than the walls.\n\nThe only thing that could make these better is if they paid my bills and told me they loved me once in awhile.\nOh, and maybe included a whitening scale, so that you could compare your teeth when you start to when you finish.",
                "After using the 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips, I saw an improvement in the color of my teeth after just four uses. This is a great product, and after my order runs out in five days, I will more than likely request a second box from Amazon. However, before you order this product, there are a few things that you need to consider.\n\n1.) Though this product works, it is nothing special. This whitening device is simply an adhesive strip of peroxide that bonds firmly to your teeth, and you can get the same whitening result by rinsing your mouth daily with hydrogen peroxide from the grocery store.\n\n2.) If you have a peroxide sensetivity, stay away from this product. Some people experience a burning sensation on their gums during usage, so I recommend rinsing with regular household peroxide to test your sensetivity before you spend $20-$30 on these whitestrips.\n\n3.) As Crest promises, these whitestrips DO NOT slip off of your teeth while you are using them. In fact, when I used them for the first time, I panicked a little when my 30 minutes were up. The strips become extremely sticky and slimy during usage, so it is almost impossible to peel them off of the front side of your teeth. I recommend pulling them off from the back of your teeth first, and though you might feel a slightly painful tug on the front of your teeth, it goes away quickly.\n\n4.) If you are going to apply these whitestrips, you MUST use a mirror to do so! It is important to place the strips RIGHT AT YOUR GUM LINE, or else you will get funky results. If you have any creases in the strip, that crease will show up on your teeth. When I used them for the first time, I did so without a mirror, and I had a thin horizontal white stripe in the center of all of my teeth. Though these lines disappear, it was very unsightly for awhile.\n\n5.) The immediate after math of using the whitestrips is not always pretty. First of all, the strips leave a thin gunky residue on your teeth, so it is important to brush afterwards. Also, the strips sometimes leave white spots or lines on the teeth. These spots are only temporary, but I do not recommmend using them right before you have to go somewhere important.\n\nOverall, I recommend this product. If you apply the Crest 3D Advanced Vivid Whitestrips according to the instructions on the included leaflet, you should see dramatically whiter teeth after you have used all of the packets in your box."

                "These are the best to use especially if you have heavy periods, I got them for my sister and she\u2019s been using them for a while and said they are very comfortable and can do overnight.",
                "Always Maxi Pads Overnight Extra Heavy Flow --\n\nEach pad comes individually wrapped in a very silky lavender plastic wrapper that can be used to dispose of the used pad. No it's not thin. It isn't supposed to be.\n\nThe pad is a GREAT 15\" LONG. Offering more protection where the flow goes which is toward our buttocks than any other on the market. I for one am tired of connecting two pads to get any semblance of protection. Even light flow doesn't go straight down, not if you have thighs which meet. Some of you are complaining that its too big, well there are plenty more petite pads on the market if you indeed need a smaller pad but for those with a heavy flow and for women above a size 14 who have a big booty we need to APPLAUD THIS PAD for finally arriving for us. I don't know why the industry didn't realize a century ago that you shouldn't be trying to make pads the same dimension when women range from 4'9\" to 6'7\". A 6-7\" long pad doesn't even protect the most direct fluid route if you're a larger lady.\n\nLying down, flow goes awry even more so and for a pad to actually deserve the title OVERNIGHT it needs to come with a nice old old fashioned belting system (just a little strip folks) and truly be more like 22\" inches long. We need a pad to reach from tummy to back of your waist if it is to prevent all staining and allow us to go to sleep without worry. These pads don't do that and I wish they did.\n\nI still say manufacturers have no idea what a heavy flow is but I'm afraid these are as good as its gets when it come to holding a lot blood. Good for postpartum. If you have adenomyosis, fibroids, endometriosis, are in peri-menopause or GOD FORBID ARE ON BLOOD THINNERS, I'm afraid even this pad will need frequent changing. Do Diapers work as an alternative? The answer is \"not so well\" as they are made of textiles meant to absorb a dilute fluid not a thick fluid. Until Proctor and Gamble gets it right the natural green brand of diapers- TUSHIES in its largest size helps some with overnight woes. If you are a tiny woman you might even be able to actually get one on completely, unwieldy to use (nothing to hold them on). Alas they are kind to sensitive skin.\n\nBack to these pads...\nFor comfort no one ever beats ALWAYS. They have made the best \"tops\", the surface that touches your skin, for over 2 decades. In other words they feel great and do stay dry. These don't have the texture of their new Infinity line but instead have that sort of plastic lace top Always came out with back in the late 70s early 80s. I wish that they applied the Infinity odor control and material to THIS SIZE. Layer the INFINITY textile over this pad. That combination of materials I think would be a SMASH HIT! Listen to MEEEE P&G.\n\nA word about those darned wings. All they do is channel moisture toward your groin and hold it there against your skin to make you chafe. They never stay in place. They don't spare your pretty panties anything. Take them away! I tuck them under [or scissor them off].\n\nThis pad has an adhesive strip protector sheet on top, and another on its back. I welcome that. When was the last time you saw a women wash her hands BEFORE entering a stall? You're handling a pad with your paws covered with every bacteria from elevator buttons, escalator rails, filthy knobs, currency, tickets, and other person's hands and then putting all those bad particles there. That TOP protective sheet lets you get the pad on without transferring all that mayhem to your groin. That area needs to be handled as sterile-y (is that a word?) as you handle your eyes but no one seems to ever say that. I wish pads were marked STERILE and were indeed that pristine.\n\nINCONTINENCE, these are useless for that purpose. Add Always Max Protection Dri Liners. They are as thin as a sheet of paper. And as teeny as they are (really short) they do hold liquid and boost the performance of any pad they are added to. Their adhesive is strong, stronger even than on these full size pads. They do not come with any kind of wrapper.\n\nI'm switching back to Always from Natracare. Went there to avoid chemicals and because there was a sort of quiet underground buzz abut Always is just not being sterile enough in their manufacturing and indeed causing infections but with heavy use Natracare's SUPER is irritating and their Nighttime Extra Long is woefully not up to par but if you want less of a pad than these they just might be right for you. I'm hoping P&G is making these in at least a CLEAN environment despite the fact that you never see the term STERILE in a sanitary product description. I think it ought to be there especially for tampons.\n\nI DO RECOMMEND THESE FOR HEAVIER FLOW DAYS but unless your body is neater than mine you'll still stain sheets until manufacturers really bring the pad to waist. That's just the simple unattractive truth of the matter.\n\nFinally the pads are WHITE, my flash may be making them look pink or purple.\n\nSOAP dot com with their great 15-20% off coupons and Amazon are running neck and neck on price.\n\nFor Natracare the best price I've found is at Lucky Vitamin The Nighttime Extra Long was $3.45 for 10.",

                "excellent color. Not to gold but classy and well made. i am very happy with my purchase.",
                "These valances are pretty - although I found the gold to be shinier than what I felt the photo showed. Also, the trim was sometimes not sewn on well and some of the gold on the trim was peeled off.",
                "I was skeptical ordering these in ivory because the on line picture looked as though they were light beige. Well, it's hard to describe, but when they are turned one way, they appear very light Ivory and when they are turned another way they look darker and not what I would call Ivory. This is due to the weave and the shine that can appear. Aside from that the valances appear to be high quality. On the window they appear to be more beige and the pretty braided trim on the bottom is not even noticeable. They are not room darkening although the white backing may help. For the money, you can't go wrong. I think my color choice might be the root of my problem, but it is all I could use for my intended room.",
                "The color was definitely gold . But hung to long for my tests for a valance .",
                "Purchased the ivory valance to put on inside of my front door. I didn't want a curtain that drew attention to it since I have busy curtains around my large living room window close by, and I'm happy as this looks neutral and blends with the room. It does have a slight shimmer to it which to me makes it look more expensive than it is. I wanted the blackout function so weirdos can't peep into my house, and it works great! Per the instructions I threw in dryer with large wet towel for 20 minutes to get out wrinkles. It got most of them out and despite the instructions advising not to iron, I did anyway (carefully) on a medium setting and only on the cloth side (and not on the blackout side as the blackout material looks like it could melt if ironed). The pic shows the true ivory color. My last comment is the pic shows there is a small ruffle that flares out above the rod and my valance does have this ruffle.",
                "The color is darker than the photo but it is a nice deep wine color, the fabric is solid. It did however have very deep wrinkles where is was folded, they recommend cold ironing, I put it on med heat and still struggled for a long time without great results. I don't know how bad the wrinkles will be if I wash them.. Also, now that I pit them on, I can see a bunch of little holes in the fabric if you look up close. Overall, the price is great and they look nice, so no major complaints.",
                "I have an awkward arch shaped window in my kitchen (double thermal paned) that I need to find a sun blocking solution for. Because it is thermal paned, I cannot put the blocking \"film\" on the window... I am looking into outside shades, etc... in the mean time, I needed a temporary solution... I am using this valance with a tension rod between my cabinets... Do I love the look of it? Not really... BUT this valance DOES have the thermal panel and IS blocking the sun. So... it will work until I can find a more suitable permanent solution. Also, the color I ordered looks just as it did in the picture... I always update if useful info or issues pop up.",
                "Valence met my expectation. I used five to cover an 83 inch arch as pictured. I'm very happy with a quality and color depicted on Amazon. So pleased that I ordered another set in dark grey for my daughter's room. I can't wait to hang those. I returned the microfiber valances that previously hung in her arch and opted for these instead since they're thicker and looks better with the white backing from the road. Both her window and mine face the same street and gives uniformity.",
                "These curtain valances are exactly what I needed to finish off my new bedroom set. They are a very good quality and are lined on the back with a rubber backing in white. I did not purchase the matching panel but I can see where they would be 100% light blocking if used over the entire window. They are true to what is advertised in size and fabric. I did not purchase these at a discount but they are really a great value for their price. To get the wrinkles out from being folded in shipping just put them in the dryer on a low setting with a damp wash cloth for about fifteen to twenty minutes. They are easy to care for which is great because dry cleaning is not in my budget. Overall I would highly recommend these curtain valances to my friends and purchase them again.",
                "We have full set on bedroom slider door and use the valances on the transom window above the bed. Definitely cuts down on the light coming in. The only negative is the white backing - I am sure it will come off over time. It already has some pin-size holes from washing. Have to be really careful when drying. Even without washing, I am sure the white backing will come off with long term exposure to Florida sun. Going forward, I will purchase the heavy duty blackout curtains without the thermaback.",
                "They are longer than expected, I should have measured better and the width was ok",
                "These definitely are black out valances, and are very thick. The quality is there, but to be honest...these look a little bit \"old lady\" to me. (Sorry old ladies...) It's the rope trim on the bottom. In the pictures it looks ok, but in person it looks kind of cheesy. I am giving these 4 stars because they are very well made, I just am not a huge fan of the look. Overall they are quality valances though and do the job.",
                "We bought this to cover an arched window above a big window in our home office. We have wooden blinds on the regular window but we were struggling to find a good way to cover the arched window. Our house faces East and in the morning the sun was just blinding. We put this up and we are so much happier. I can work in the office any time without having to squint and it is also much cooler in there. We have a couple more windows that could use some curtains, so we will probably be buying some more of this brand.",
                "Originall I purchased this thinking it would look great in the living room. After getting them I chose to put them over our sliding glass doors off our dining room. It was a great, inexpensive way to add some class to our dining room. I purchased one more (a total of 4) to put one over the door off the kitchen to bring both rooms together. They are GREAT quality for the price!!",
                "The quality of these valances were better than anticipated! After a quick iron with low heat, they were ready to hang. The valance at the width I ordered doesn\u2019t bunch, but it doesn\u2019t need to with the scalloped edge. The fabric\u2019s texture adds just enough visual interest to keep it from looking plain.

                "As they say, you get what you pay for. This wipe is as described but truly a \"bulk\" purchase. Bargain price has its draw backs. The wipes are thrown in a box, no way to count them, no way to store them other than removing them from the box and storing them in a giant zip lock bag, single container or just leaving them in the box as shipped. They are packaged for commercial use but for the money - a good deal.",

These are much thinner, a bit smaller, and not wet enough to be useful. I use three of these towelettes in place of one of the other brand. Going to throw these out and replace them with what I bought before.",
                "Here are the pros & cons of this product as I see it, I hope this helps you.\nPros:\n1. Nice lemon smell\n2. Very convenient size to carry some around\n3. Nice and refreshing to use\n4. Nice price point\n5. Bring back good memories using these when eating out when I was a child\nCons:\n1. Wipes are a little thin and small, so if you have big hands or eat something really messy you might need 2 or 3, but I don't find that to big of a deal\n2. About 2% of the box I bought are dried out when you open them",
                "These are moist towelettes but are not antibacterial and are not anti-virus. They are the kind of towelettes you're given at a restaurant after greasy hand foods like ribs or fried chicken where you use your fingers to eat. They are slightly flimsy so often tear when unfolding. We keep these in the car so when kids eat, they can clean up their hands. They do exactly what they're advertised to do. They are not made to protect from germs the way sanitizing wipes are. It's disappointing that they're so flimsy but wipes like these are hard to find these days (even before the coronavirus). You might need to use a few at one time, given the flimsiness, but they do the trick when traveling.",

                "We use these wipes in the notary business. They work well in a final cleaning of the finger print ink from a client's thumbs. These small, thin, moisturized paper, cleaning cloths are easy to open, dispose of, and even relatively inexpensive in comparison to competitor products.\nIn some senses, you could call them green because they are small, with little impact on the environment, i.e., cutting down trees and minimizing impact to landfills, and practically eliminates the need for running water to clean the hands.",
                "Whether traveling or at home, somebody always has sticky fingers. We always keep these handy for easy cleanup!\n\nI wish they were a little bigger and thicker because sometimes I have to use two. But, still a good buy.",

It\u2019s terrible, then I tried one and want to figure a way to use it up. It caused my skin itchin, my gos I don\u2019t have sensitive skin. It\u2019s really wasting my money and it\u2019s a kind of cheating",

So whether I have to wipe my own paws or my pup's, I'm prepared. They're also great for mopping down a sweaty face or saving the day when your deodorant fails.",
                "With the rapid rise of COVID-19 I am thankful to have received these while still avialable-a little bit smaller than expected but individually wrapped is key to keep on hand in purse, car, shoppping bags to wipe inside car door handles/levers/buttons, shopping cart handles etc while we ride out the effects of corona virus.",
                "They are obviously old because opening 3 of them, they are almost dried out. Not eligible for return for a reason.",
                "The naps are very thin so they tear easily but it\u2019s great for just wiping your hands. I keep a hand full in my car, drawers around the house, kitchen. They work well for other things as well. They would be absolutely amazing if they were slightly bigger and thicker. But you can\u2019t beat this value"

Now what does help is they come in 36x30 squares so what I did was when I opened the package I took a sharp scissors cause these pads are THICK! Compared to other pads but trust me the cheaper pads don\u2019t protect like these do. So I cut the large pad across the package folds in half and then I fold the each of the two pieces together and cut along the new fold. Making 4 pieces out of one large square. The left over pieces cut nicely and hence makes more extending chuck quantity. Hope this helps. Hope there prices go down but they are absolutely the best and don\u2019t fall apart when wet.",
                "These are great for accidents and spills. If no accident occurs they can be used on a bed for several days. I dispose of them when the absorbent material finally gets wadded up and pulled apart - but the green plastic part has never torn. I feel like that's a good sign- if the green plastic part tore before the absorbent part then I would be worried about leaks. Their size is perfect. They fit all the way across a twin or hospital bed and they fit under a persons entire worrisome backside area.",

                "I search for a floss that would replace my Listerine one and decided to try this a year or two ago. Actually, I like it better. It cleans well, it wraps around my fingers without binding down and hurting them, but don\u2019t slip when wet. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had a floss that did all that. It costs a bit more than others, but I think it\u2019s worth it.",
                "My dental hygienist recommended this to me. My first thought was, \"What difference could the brand of floss you use matter.\"\nAfter using Dr. Tung I know. I even ran a test using my old brand name floss and then the Dr. Tung. Dr. Tung\nremoved small particles left behind by my other floss.\nThanks to Kim I will not return to the old floss.\nGreat product.",
                "Recommended by our hygienist when unable to find our usual floss at the grocery or drug store. Nice dispenser, gets in tight places, but can expand to fuzzy if needed. Also, it\u2019s strong, does not shred & is wax free!",
                "This floss is great for teeth that have both gaps and tight places. The flavor is natural and not too strong.",
                "Somehow this floss makes it a pleasure to floss.",
                "In the year or so that I've been using this product, the Floss worked perfectly, easy to slide out of the container. But yesterday, a NEW container was having a problem: the Floss had been loaded BACKWARDS not the \"spool\" and would NOT come out. If there's any way I can talk to the Production Staff, I'd appreciate it.",
                "Really love this floss\u2026it holds up quite well and only had a problem with it shredding once\u2026it does a great job of cleaning debris from between teeth and around each tooth. The flavor is great\u2026while mint is fine for most, it is often too strong for my gums, causing them to become irritated. This is a nice, mild flavor. I\u2019ve already stocked up on it\u2026certainly don\u2019t want to run out!",
                "I am a dental hygienist and I recommend this to all my patients who are interested in flossing effectively. Many floss, but are using products that are ineffective. This floss is easier to hold and has more surface area to grab plaque and debris. Significantly better product than any of the slippery style flosses available. I tell patients the slippery types of floss just \u201cglide\u201d past everything you are trying to remove.",
                "The best I've ever tried. I love the material the flavor. It is so nice to use. I never liked flossing. Now I do :)) I ordered 12 pcs at once because this is it.",
                "I've tried all kinds of flosses out there and this is super mega-miles the best. I have a very sensitive body and do not like those nasty artificial \"mint\" flavorings in conventional flosses. They make my gums burn. I used to use the \"unflavored High-Tech\" generic floss at CVS pharmacy but they stopped carrying it and only have the mint version - arrrhhhh- no mint! That's why I was so happy to discover Dr. Tung's natural floss with natural cardamom flavoring. It doesn't irritate my gums. The best part of this floss for me is that the fibers fan out really wide when between the teeth and I can visibly see much more \"junk and plaque\" on the string than with other brands.\n\nNOTE: Some people are complaining of shredding. Here's my tip: a couple of years ago when I used to buy this product, it used to shredded a lot because my teeth are spaced very close together. They must have improved their floss because it rarely shreds anymore. Just maybe 20% of the time I used it. I noticed that it usually shreds in my back molars where the space is tightest. One way I learned to minimize shredding is to floss straight up and down in those tight spaces - meaning, I don't floss at an angle. I have found that this almost always minimizes the shredding. Also, some of my molars have pointy ends, so I'm wondering if this is just tearing the floss when it comes into contact with the jagged ends? I am just more careful not to let it touch the pointy parts of my teeth and I think that prevents cutting of the floss. Now go enjoy this amazing cloth-like floss. It's such a great sensation and makes flossing, dare I say, actually fun?!",
                "I have long-standing issues with gum recession and pocketing, and I therefore brush and floss religiously and sleep with a night guard. It was a losing battle until I threw out my electric toothbrush and bought a Colgate 360 manual brush. (Highly recommend.) Then we had some notable improvement, but only to a point. I had also been looking for a woven floss for ages, but even the nasty mint-infused one I used to use seems to have disappeared. My dentist told me even he couldn't get it anymore, but still recommended I get some if I could. So I went searching online, and stumbled across this floss. I bought a 6-pack in desperation, based on the ridiculously positive reviews. I didn't understand how a dental floss could generate such enthusiasm. I mean, it's floss! But it's not like any other floss I've ever used. My teeth feel so clean after I use it. Also, I love the taste. I love mint, but not in my floss. This flavor is much more natural than most dental products. But the kicker was this: My dental hygienist was amazed at the improvement in the pocketing after I had been using this floss for only a month or two! I brought some in for my visit, and both she and the dentist approved of it, though neither had ever heard of it. After getting confirmation that I wasn't delusional about how great this floss is, I ordered another 12-pack. It arrived almost immediately. Now I won't have to worry about running out for a good long while.",
                "If you want it to thicken up right away, you'll want you to run it under the faucet for a moment.",
                "My husband and I have used this for years! Very effective!",
                "Since they have stopped making the Listerine Gentle Gum Care Floss, I have tried tons of different flosses but this one is great! I thought the cardamom flavor was going to be weird but to be honest I hardly even notice it. It is strong and cleans very well.",
                "I tried Smart Floss for a while when the Listerine woven floss was discontinued.\n\nI found that Smart Floss is easy to use, doesn't shred, and has a nice feel. It's thicker than other flosses but still slides well in my tight spaces. However, I've had more trouble with a few little spots of inflammation when using this, and my dentist could tell that I had been flossing daily but was puzzled about the inflammation and buildup. I ended up finding that this floss was not as effectively removing plaque from between my teeth, especially down near the roots, as other flosses I've used. I've been able to make it work better by \"scrubbing\" with it, but it just takes much longer to floss that way.\n\nI'll probably be switching back to Hayden expanding floss, which I had also used for a while and which gave better results for me at the dentist office.",
                "Short version - This floss is perfection. Okay, I know it is just floss, but I am a huge fan of this stuff. I like is that it isn't minty - it supposedly has some sort of flavor, but I really don't notice it. Who needs flavor in floss? Also, I like that it isn't waxed. Waxed floss always seems to leave residue behind and this doesn't do that. The floss is woven so it expands when it needs to, but can stretch to fit easily between tight teeth. And, it isn't skinny and sharp so it doesn't cut into my gums. So yeah, perfect - I will be distressed if this ever goes off the market.",
                "Thick enough to get stuff out, thin enough to get inbetween my (very) closely spaced teeth and my teeth definitely feel clean, clean, clean after I use it. It never misses a speck! Price is great, also. Whenever I offer my friends some after lunch I preface it with \"do you want to try the best floss ever?\"\n\nSide note: it does have a tiny amount of some \"natural plant and bees was coating\" which I think clumps up when I floss between particularly closely spaced teeth and it appears as if I have flossed out a tiny bit of white stuff. At first I thought it was stuff on my teeth, but after double checking with another floss I realized it's probably the wax. Now I just know what it looks like and ignore it. It is *very* subtle and doesn't leave residue in your mouth. (Definitely less coating than several of the other flosses I've tried)\n\nAnother note just in case you didn't know, if you floss something out from between teeth, make sure to keep flossing that space until nothing comes out. Just because you flossed there once, doesn't mean you got it all. I must say, however, this particular floss is pretty good and I rarely have to floss more than twice between teeth that had some food residue.",
                "Adjustable in teeth, so cleans better",
                "works well, quick delivery",
                "Product is just as described, and lasts a long time since there\u2019s so many in the package. Gets the job done. I haven\u2019t had too many issues with fraying or anything like that, which is nice since I have a lingual retainer. Doesn\u2019t have a strong flavour, which is also nice. This is a great alternative to the Listerine Woven Floss."

            "reviews": [
                "I used to have this on auto ship from GNC but they suddenly decided to stop carrying this particular brand. This is the best melatonin I've found for the price. Excellent value, highly recommend.",
                "Flavor is fine. I think that I sleep better on the days I use but still have some restlessness. Not sure how to gauge effectiveness honestly.",
                "Multiple droppers were broken",
                "My daughter (12) hates taking pills and funnies taste awful to her. So this was perfect for her! Take alone or mix with some juice and she sleeps so much better when she can\u2019t relax her brain.",
                "After years of trying to get my kids to bed at a decent hour I finally asked their pediatrician what to do. My daughter has an autism spectrum disorder and is on an anti-depressant for mood disorders. I used to give her Hylands Calm Forte for Kids but we were up to eight tablets and it still wasn't effective. Not to mention I had to force them in her mouth so they'd dissolve. She knows if there is something in her drink and she will not take any medications that she can taste. Her psychiatrist suggested giving her Benadryl at bedtime but I am not comfortable doing that. She would have lights out then lay in bed for up to an hour each night. After reading online reviews of this product I purchased it for both my children. My daughter gets one dropperful (1ml) in Sprite and she doesn't even notice it. What a blessing.\nI also bought it for our son who is five and hyperactive. He also has behavior disorders. He would toss and turn, talk, and fidget forever before he finally fell asleep. Even as a toddler at naptime in preschool he would not sleep and would keep the other kids awake with his restlessness. I started him on the 2 dropperfuls (2ml) which is the full dose. The first night he fell asleep after twenty minutes. I kept him on this dose until school let out. I now give him 1 dropperful each night and he falls asleep within thirty minutes usually. He takes it directly without mixing it into anything.\n\nI truly recommend this product to anyone with children who have sleep difficulty. I wish I had started using this product years ago with my kids. I've had many late nights with my kids because they just couldn't fall asleep.",
                "I've been using this for my 7 year old for a couple of years. Prior to this, bedtime was a real beast, no matter how tired he was, where he would spend an hour and more playing, jumping up and down on and off the bed, and be completely hyper until he would finally quit and fall asleep. There was no way he would fall asleep early enough on school nights on his own. Now, I give him half or a little less than half of the dropper - he weighs 60lbs - in his night time juice, and he calms down, and about 30 - 45 minutes later, he is ready to get into bed for story time. The taste is so faint that you can hide it in almost anything, which I have to do, but it's not at all unpleasant if you want to use it straight from the bottle. This has let my child get the sleep he needs and saved my sanity. It's also great for me since I am a light sleeper and can't get back to sleep if I'm woken up. Just take a dropper full and I won't be staring at the ceiling for hours waiting for morning.",
                "Our pediatrician suggested a melatonin supplement to help our 3-year-old have a better sleep schedule. My husband is a night owl and she had slowly joined his routine. My daughter throws a fit anytime I try to giver her anything like medication and can only find pills and chewable tabs locally. I was so glad to find these drops on Amazon.\n\nI add the drops to a small amount of sugar-free punch. She has no problems with it and will sometimes even ask for her \"night time\" drink. I have tried pills for myself in the past, but these drops work much faster.\n\nI would describe the taste as citrus and a tad odd. It bothered me at first, but now it is fine. The directions say to take 2 ml, which should be 2 dropper fulls. I could not get the dropper to fill to the 1 ml mark, so I usually just fill it to the 0.75 ml mark 3 times, close enough. There is a 0.25 ml mark but it's harder to get it to that amount.\n\nMy sister and I were discussing melatonin supplements for our kids and I told her I had found drops on Amazon and she said she did too. I described the bottle (the name had escaped me) and they are the same ones she ordered, she loves this product too.\n\nI just ordered my second time through Subscribe 'n Save and can't wait for it to arrive.",
                "Some will tell you melatonin supplements are \"snake oil\" and only trick you into thinking you'll fall asleep, so you do. I can say that Sleep Soundly does work, since my special needs daughter can't be given a placebo, since she is non-verbal and wouldn't understand the implication.\n\nMy daughter's sleep cycle is very easily interrupted by something as simple as an inactive day (uncommon, but occasionally we have a lazy weekend), and for years whenever this happened, we were having trouble getting her back on cycle. She would be up all night and then have trouble staying awake the next day... until we found this. Sleep Soundly warns it's not for children, so before giving it to her, we talked with our pediatrician and she said that it's safe enough that we could even give it to our toddler without ill effect; there's simply no way to overdose on melatonin (definitely talk to your pediatrician before giving this product to children, though. Never believe everything you read on the internet!).",
                "I normally don't write reviews but this stuff is awesome. My daughter has an extreme case of ADHD and even after waking up at 6:00 a.m. and having a day full of non stop playing, she fights her sleep everyday and will not actually fall asleep until midnight. After doing about 5 hours research and not finding any negative side effects I thought I'd try it. The best thing about it is that it taste like sugar so you can put it in milk or juice without them knowing. She can always tell if her apple juice or milk tastes different, but not with this. Some say it works within 5 minutes but my girl still takes around 30minutes to finally wind down then within the next 30 minutes, she passes out. Just ran out tonight and its going to be a long night I can tell. I don't understand how these kids can keep going all day non stop and still be wide awake at night. My daughter gets 10x better sleep with this and isnt cranky the next day from not getting enough deep sleep. If you are questioning whether it is healthy or not, I would say it's definitely healthier for your kids to get a full nights sleep and be well rested.",
                "I purchased this product for my son who is 11. I used to give my son a different type of drops when he was younger but it had a slight flavor to it which he didn't like. I then changed to the chewables since he was older. I couldn't figure out why they weren't working as well as the drops. It turns out he was hiding them in places around the house instead of taking them. I purchased these and they have been working like a charm. He can not taste any difference in his pediasure at night. He has been sleeping like he should be.",
                "This stuff really works! I take some about 20 minutes before I'm ready to go to sleep and it does the job in making me drowsy and getting me to sleep. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is that it doesn't help me stay asleep all night. I'll sometimes awaken a few hours later and am not able to get back to sleep. If it's at least 4 hours before I have to get up in the morning, though, I'll take a little more of this liquid to help me get back to sleep. I recently tried a \"timed release\" tablet version of Melatonin (also purchased on Amazon - see my other reviews) in hopes it would keep me asleep all night, but I ended up throwing the nearly full bottle of it in the trash because it did absolutely nothing -- it never even made me drowsy. I ended up buying this product again because I had such good luck with it helping me get to sleep.",
                "I was a little leery about using melatonin for my son but after reading the reviews I decided to give it a try. My son, who has special needs, was going through a rough patch and couldn't get to sleep at night. My doctor recommended melatonin. I chose this one based on others reviews myself. I give him two droppers an hour before bed and it immediately calms him and settles him for sleep. As others have mentioned, I give my son a \"break\" every month for about a week or so. I did notice that his night time sleep patterns would get disturbed, he'd be wide awake at 4:30. When that happened I would give him a break, he'd go down fine (because he was so tired from waking up early) and when I noticed him have trouble settling we would use it again. He has actually been off for a month now because he is going down fine without it. I think it's a great product: great value, non habit forming, and as no funky taste!",
                "With approval from the pediatrician we started this melatonin 2 weeks ago. I started off w/ one dropper full and now I give him one half of a dropper, with the same effect. My son, who has sensory, motor and speech disorders has never slept well. He is 31 months old. He slept about 9 hours a night, sometimes a lot less, no naps. Now he is at 11-12 hours a night. Asleep within 30 minutes, and can't keep his eyes open, he is that tired. Where we go from here, I don't know. Our therapists say he shouldn't need it for long, his natural melatonin should kick in, but from what I've read that isn't always the case. I think I'll try .33 of a ml next. All I know is we are getting decent sleep, and not having to soothe my son to sleep for an hour each night is a BLESSING.\n-by the way, I put the melatonin in with his Zyrtec dose and he drinks it down in a medicine cup. Easy peasy.",
                "Good product - has helped with sleep for quite some time!",
                "My dog has Cushing\u2019s disease and the melatonin keeps her panting symptoms under control. Without it, I would have to put her on expensive medication.",
                "We have a 7 year old child with moderate autism, who has severe sleep disturbances. We,(us and our son)hadn't had a full nights sleep in years. Our son's pediatric neurologist prescribed 3 mg of melatonin a night to help him sleep. The change was immediate! The dosing is easy, small, and the taste is easily masked in any drink. Our son has his in his hot cocoa 30 minutes before bedtime. The first night he was asleep within 45 minutes of drinking the product. He stayed asleep all night, and he was well rested and easily roused in the morning. This has been the case ever since then. The changes during the day are amazing as well. He is more focused, happy, has fewer meltdowns. His teachers at school all have marked his improvement. He looks healthier, well rested. This brand is excellent. The dosing per bottle adds up to an incredible value. The only downside has been that the included dropper is not able to draw the entire dose in one pull. I just draw smaller multiple doses to keep the amount accurate.",
                "So I use these for my very active (borderline hyperactive) child. Sometimes he doesn\u2019t want to go to sleep. These things are NO JOKE. There is a trick to them. You can\u2019t give them to a child and let the child run free. These are best administered while reading a bedtime story or while giving an after bath lotion rub. Usually he\u2019s out within 20 minutes and sleeps soundly. My other older children also use them and have great experiences sleeping.",
                "I'm using the product to replace the prescription drugs I take for sleep. They are hardcore addictive drugs that I have been taking for years. I've been taking Sleep Soundly Melatonin for a few days as well as cutting my Rx dosage in half. I've had a couple of good nights sleep so far. I know it's not going to happen overnight, but I have high hopes this will work for me. I have taken melatonin in tablet form before and I didn't get very good results at all.",
                "My niece has autism and ADHD so we have an extremely hard time with getting her to sleep on a regulated schedule. Her doctor recommend trying melitonon before we go to a prescription drug. We had tried the tablets but had a hard time getting her to take them so tried gummies and had no effect at all. We then purchased this as she takes liquor form medication the best so figured she might take this easier but expected it to have little or no effect on her in the end. We were so surprised when it kicked in with in 10 min or less! It has also allowed us to keep her on a lower dose than what we had to use with tablets and gummies to even get any effect from them.",
                "I loved the product but only received 1 bottle, I bought a pack of 3. Can someone from the company please reach out to me and send me the rest of my order."

            "reviews": [
                "Update: I\u2019m changing my initial review from 1 star to 3 because the desk is actually not so bad but the quality control is pretty shoddy. My initial desk came with pieces that were bent and warped beyond anything imaginable and the Walker Edison company was mostly unhelpful with fixing the issue. They essentially said to order a second one, swap out the parts I need, and ship the other one back. Now I have to figure out how to get this 60lb cumbersome box taped back up and delivered to my local UPS Store. Frustrating to say the least.\n\nNow I\u2019ll hope and pray the desk doesn\u2019t become a ticking time bomb and the glass doesn\u2019t randomly explode.\n\u2014\u2014\nSave your money and your sanity and find a better desk elsewhere. First of all, if you order the Alexa curved desk, the keyboard slides are welded on and can\u2019t be removed. Honestly, I could have tolerated that but the fact that I can\u2019t even assemble this huge pile of junk takes the cake! The curved center piece came with a really shoddy welding job that was bent and broken. Because of that, the bolt holes no longer align so no matter what I do, there\u2019s no assembling these two pieces. It can\u2019t be bent back into place either. Trust me, I\u2019ve tried.\n\nI\u2019ve reached out to the manufacturer but I\u2019m doubtful as to how fast they\u2019ll make this right. As of now, I\u2019m stuck working on the floor with a broken desk that\u2019s unreturnable. If they respond back or take measures to help, I\u2019ll update this review. As of now, though, two thumbs WAY down!",
                "I would buy it at the sale price again with it's issues... But only in the same circumstances of placement and that I don't need the keyboard tray. Most likely I got an one off from the factory and you might have better luck.\n\nI have three complaints that stem from one issue, measurements. One of the glass panels is slightly (nearly a centimeter) bigger front to back than the others making it not hold perfectly true in a corner. This could be fixed by adding a plastic edge to the back, but I don't think you can find one for the curve. The holes were slightly off center meaning I had to undo the rest in order to get everything to line up. Both of those issues were on the right side. The third is the keyboard tray on the left side won't fully close due to the back being slightly closer together than the front. I don't know if it's because the weld was done at a bit of an angle, an issue with placement of holes on the glass again or the length of the bars attaching the back legs. If not on sale Amazon has one without the keyboard tray for just slightly higher than the sale price of this one, and you can but a clamp on keyboard tray for about $25-$40.\n\nFor my purposes the desk doesn't need to be in a corner and the right side is the one on the wall, so you don't notice the first issue and I can use the keyboard on the top. Plus it was on sale, so it's cheaper than a similar model without the tray. It does look really nice and gives me much more space than my old setup, so I guess I can overlook the issues. And I'm not bothered enough to take it apart and send it in for a replacement.",
                "I love the look and simplicity of the desk. However the assembly was not the best. The measurements are slightly off so I struggled with making sure the glass didn\u2019t overlap (which could result in shattering). Although the instructions suggest doing the larger glass pieces first, I recommend starting with the smaller middle piece and working your way out. In addition to that, the table just didn\u2019t align correctly. I believe that\u2019s an issue with the legs and how you secure them together. My biggest issue is was the keyboard tray. Due to the legs lack of proper alignment I was unable to install my keyboard tray at all which is a pretty essential part of this desk. I didn\u2019t bother returning because I honestly think it\u2019s an overall manufacturing issue. For the price it wasn\u2019t a bad deal and it\u2019s really stylish so that helps.",
                "Components don\u2019t assemble or lineup very well, and the glass arrived chipped on one of the panels. I was able to file it down and smooth it out with a wet sanding cloth. The sliding keyboard tray is pretty much useless and the height is not adjustable.",
                "This desk is actually really nice looking, sleek, and modern. It has quite a bit of space for anything you need. The glass is tempered and is holding up well with some weight. The glass does not appear to scratch easily but it obviously needs to be cleaned often. The only issue I had was that one of the screw holes on the underside of the desk (attaching the left side of the frame to the center portion of the frame) was not drilled properly at all and became stripped. As long as you calibrate the position and torque of your screws after you've assembled the desk, the three separate glass tops will sit relatively flush with one another. Overall, especially for the price, this is an amazing desk.",
                "Assembly was straight forward and only needed an extra Phillips screwdriver. It fit together well. My only complaint is the glass panels didn't exactly match up on one \"corner\" where it the end piece met the corner triangle piece. It was small but noticeable. Figured for the price and the fact they are mass produced, it was reasonable. Assembled it is very sturdy and I already have it loaded up with a laptop and extra monitor and several notebooks. I did follow a previous reviewers suggestion and used the keyboard tray as a stand for the monitor. That required a trip to the hardware store for some legs and drilling thru the corners of the metal frame of the keyboard piece.",
                "This is a very sturdy table, and looks really nice now that it is set up.\n\nThe Cons: when you go to fit the glass on the table the holes do not align at all you will be forcing it to fit. This part was frustrating and almost sent it back. I am sure it was a defect in the manufacturing of the holes. But this does need work. So we dont plan on having to take it down anytime soon. Because it was such a pain to get the glass on top to align. Everything else was great. We just did a lot of walking away from it while putting the glass pieces on.lol It was for my son who is six foot he is not able to use the keyboard drawer, he is to tall so he took it out another down side. Howerever with that being said he just puts the keyboard on top no biggie and took the drawer out. At the price point once together it is a sturdy table. But if you are tall and having the keyboard drawer matters this table will be to short for the tall people. Hope this helps",
                "I need to mention that I got this for 50% off on sale. If I\u2019d paid the sticker price of over $200 I would absolutely not be okay with what I got.\n\nAssembly was a pain in contrast to what others have said. It\u2019s just screwing things together but I must have ended up with a part that is too small or otherwise ill fitting somewhere in here. I\u2019ve managed to get every screw into every hole but some of them required a monumental effort on my part and it was clear I was pushing the pieces to their limits to get it together. At the same time I can only really say every piece is screwed in, unfortunately I\u2019m left with one of the glass panes at a pretty noticeable slant. I wouldn\u2019t be able to fluidly slide something across the right angle of the desk for example.\n\nI\u2019d be cautious about the leg room if you need the keyboard tray. I\u2019m pretty thin and 5\u201911 so far from a giant and it\u2019s definitely pushing it. I don\u2019t really feel this is shown accurately in the images.\n\nThe glass is quite nice but the legs themselves definitely have a super cheap look to them, huge welding marks at the corners and all.\n\nOverall it\u2019s about the minimum of what I\u2019d have been okay with at the sales price. If you\u2019re seeing it for $200 I\u2019d look elsewhere.",
                "I needed a stylish desk bigger but not too big for home office. It was easy to assemble and it\u2019s very sturdy. It has an extra warp around for a laptop or other items. I love it!",
                "Buyer Beware! After setting this up a few months later the glass has popped out of place with the silver brackets that was attached to it. The corner piece is now just resting on the metal and so is the right side. I haven't had this this for not even a year yet and it's broke. Now I can probably super blu the brackets back on to the glass but I would have to disassemble the entire desk to do so which is a pain in the butt and I'm afraid the desk might actually shatter. SELLER IF YOU'RE READING THIS PLEASE CONTACT ME FOR A REPLACEMENT. THANK YOU.",
                "PROS:\n- Fits perfect in small spaces\n- Looks great!\n\nCONS:\n- Keyboard tray not big enough for standard size keyboard + mouse. You will need a smaller keyboard or you'll end up putting the mouse on the desk top.\n- Annoying to build. Had to unscrew/screw in some bolts more than a few times due to needing more/less space in certain areas for the glass to fit properly.",
                "I love the office table for my small office room. Love the glass look in my office setting, I have a double screen on this table but my keyboard pull out never worked and fell off the desk, I now use the top of table for keyboard.",
                "It\u2019s a desk that fits in my space. Not sure how other people were able to change around which side the keyboard part was on, since the fittings for it are welded on. The sliding mechanism for the keyboard is a bit difficult to use. I\u2019ve got long legs and each section is pretty narrow, so I bump it a bit, but not too badly",
                "I love my desk! I had seen another desk at Office Depot dame design but it was larger and more money. I saw this desk and knew I could get same look but better because the size of this desk is more appropriate for my space. I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because the corner glass piece did not align properly with the two halves during assembly. It\u2019s a little off but the desk still looks great.",
                "Great for small space but assembly is a bust! Nice style but good luck getting the top glass pieces to align with holes and the sliding keyboard tray instructions were awful. Took me and dh over an hour to get it right and even then, it doesn't slide smoothly. Illustrations for tray in instructions are not the same as the actual arms/bearings are different.",
                "It was not as easy to assemble as I would have preferred. Yes the instructions were very easy and clear however the pieces did not fit together 100% when it was time to screw them down. It worked out for the most part so I am pleased with the desk.",
                "This desk sits pretty low, and the glass panel that is supposed to hold the keyboard is pretty much useless unless you're a very short person. I've had to remove it so that my legs have more leg room and I place my keyboard and mouse on top of the desk. I am 6'2. Other than that, it's fine.",
                "The desk is really nice and fits the space I need it to. It was definitely a 2-man job to build it. Instructions were simple enough. There were some adjustments that had to be made to put the legs together and have the glass sit properly but it fit just fine",
                "I absolutely love my desk. Its beautiful, has plenty of leg room for a 5ft girl Lol. Sturdy and holds my big monitor and 2 small speakers. It came well packaged, and I received it a day early. However, the instructions as I was told by my frustrated fiance who assembled it, could have been better written. Other than that, im in love with my desk and not to mention you can't beat that price.",
                "I purchased this desk for a home office that might double as a guest room so space was an issue for me. This L-shaped desk fits nicely in the corner and is big enough for me to have plenty of workspace but also not completely dominate the room.\n\nThe desk took a little over an hour to put together and the instructions were pretty easy to follow.\n\nThe construction seems sturdy and once put together the desk looks really modern.\n\nMy only negatives (very minor) are first, the package that the desk comes in is really really heavy. I went to go pick it up from my apartment office and I could not lift it, no one in the office could lift it, and one my husband got there he had a lot of difficulty trying to lift it.\nAlso, in the picture it shows a stand for the tower. This is basically just a rectangular piece of metal that sits on the floor, not connected to anything and to me, doesn't really serve much of a purpose.\n\nOverall, the desk is great and I would definitely recommend it - I would just suggest you have someone there with you to help you carry the box."

                "It's tough to find jeans that fit and look flattering on a tall skinny guy like me, but these do the trick. Bonus points to Amazon for being one of the few retailers that carry them in my size (31x34... not even the Levi's store has them!).\n\nThese have a similar fit to classic 501s, but with a lower rise that is more fashionable and also much more flattering on a long-legged man. I could use a little more room in the crotch and a bit of a boot cut would be nice, but overall the fit is very good.\n\nThe waist tabs are a cool detail but have no real practical purpose. The snaps aren't very strong and will come unsnapped if you use the tabs to adjust the fit. This isn't really a con for me though because the jeans fit me so well to begin with and I always wear a belt anyway.\n\nThe fabric is also great; it's soft and no break in period is necessary.\n\nThe color is a very nice dark blue, which allows them to be dressed up or dressed down. I should mention that there was a lot of excess dye in these jeans. I had to wash these several times before they stopped dying my legs blue (they also dyed the back of my messenger bag, which tends to rub against my thigh as I walk). It's not an issue anymore now that I've had them for a couple months, but it was very frustrating in the beginning.\n\nUpdate: I've had these jeans since August, 2010, and they are still going strong. They have faded considerably and look super-casual with a lot of whiskering. They are also prone to stretch a fair amount and need to be washed and dried on high heat after several wears to shrink them back down to a comfortable size. Still, the denim has held up really well aside from some fraying on the left front pocket and they are still my go-to jeans. Just wish I could find another pair in my size with this wash.",
                "What is wrong with the designers at Levi's?? They create a perfect pair of blue jeans (the 514's are the ONLY jeans I'll buy), and then the designers will do really stupid things to them, like sew on snap-tabs at the waist or a semi-hidden zippered pocket on the right hip (both of which this pair is cursed with), or ridiculous jean-jacket button flaps on the rear pockets (this pair doesn't have those, but Levi's makes 'em). Thanks for wasting my time, Levi's... these are going back.",
                "I love these jeans. Who would have though that after years of paying like $200 for jeans, my favorites would cost less than $40. The wash is awesome, the fit is perfect and they are well constructed. I have no butt, and the way these jeans fit makes good use of what little I have back there. Love the back pocket details as well.",

                "Was very disappointed in the very thin light weight fabric in these jeans. A denim jean supposedly but for winter wear would not be feasible. Need to make these in a heavier denim.",

                "Better quality than any other paper towel, they are a class all by themselves. Yes, they are sturdy, and not so loosely wound that they fly off when you want to grab some. For those that struggle with having to use them one-handed, I would suggest pre-loosening one in anticipation before an \"emergency\", so it is easy to grab when your hand(s) is(are) mucky; not so difficult. Some would think this too \"unsightly\", to have a sheet or two hanging loosely, but their lives will be made difficult in all matters with that mindset. Also, using a firmly mounted towel holder, like an under-the-cabinet towel holder, rather than a countertop stand, will hold it firmly enough to pull off a sheet. I actually quite happy that they don't unroll too easily and flop about. I don't want the entire roll coming off in one tug. They hold still, so they can be torn off without too much coming unrolled, and with one can tear it off with just one hand, rather than having to steady the roll so it won't all come undone. When I know I'm going to need to use some, whether for cooking, in the art studio, or whatever and wherever, I take off what I know I'll need and I have it ready to go. It's kind of a no-brainer. And if you're using it without a holder and you happen to drop the roll, it won't go bouncing off, unrolling as it goes along. Well, it may go bouncing off, but it won't unroll everywhere. I like that.\n\nViva, don't change a thing\u2026 if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Viva has a loyal following for those who want a thick, useful paper towel, one that isn't loosely wound, like the other brands that give a false appearance of having more of their filmsy junk than is actually there. The \"Choose-A-Sheet\" is just right, as often what is needed is either the smallest option, a single sheet (equal to a regular \"half sheet\"), or three sheets (equal to a regular sheet-and-a-half).",
                "The most soft paper towel I\u2019ve ever used. I love them",
                "I just have to say that I love these paper towels. They are soft, absorbent, and can substitute as a napkin at the table, even for a more formal meal, in a pinch.\n\nYet, there are downsides. I'll address them:\n\n1) These paper towels are expensive. As a stay-at-home mom, I feel as if these paper towels are a splurge. And yet, they are so useful. When using a paper towel to swipe at a yucky mess on the kitchen counter (like raw chicken juices), I only need one small piece of paper towel (the choose-a-sheet option is so handy). When cleaning bathroom mirrors, a full sheet takes care of an entire mirror. When we grab a roll to keep in the car, a child can use a sheet as a \"plate\" for small bites of cheese and salami and then wipe his or her hands on it afterwards.\n\n2) Store brands work just as well. Sorry; I beg to differ. These paper towels are so soft that I can wipe my two-year-old's face with them and she doesn't complain. The paper towels are so absorbent that just one usually does the trick. Furthermore, it is even fun to use them because they do feel like a splurge!\n\n3) The natural-minded family should be using cloth paper towels and napkins. Yeah, I agree with that one. You should check out Moo Cow Mama's Etsy listings for bright, adorable cloth napkins: https://www.etsy.com/listing/123470498/beach-cloth-napkins-summer-decor-beach?ref=shop_home_feat_3\nLet's just say that my family is getting there. I picked up some cheap cloth napkins at Wal-Mart and they work just fine. They're a good option. There are just seasons when it is nice to have a disposable option.\n\nOkay, so if you do have a baby, like me, you need to use these paper towels to make your own baby wipes. Recipe + instructions here: http://hip2save.com/2014/01/06/video-how-to-make-homemade-baby-wipes/",
                "While the price point for the Viva line may be a bit higher as compared to other leading brands, the extra few cents per roll is well worth it. These towels are sturdy and absorbent for cleaning up any mess, but work well for a wide variety of tasks. The select-a-size is an added bonus since you do not have to waste an entire sheet for something less daunting. I keep a few rolls out in the garage for general use (paint, grease, oil cleanup) as well as one in each of my vehicles. They have the durability to be squeezed out and reused for applications like water cleanup. The only drawback is a relatively minor one - when cleaning glass or similar objects such as a car, there are a few tiny fibers which are left behind. This makes it a bit more challenging to use them for Windex, and probably shouldn't be used on a car if you care about tiny scratches. You should stick to a lint-free cloth for electronic screen and car finishes as you might expect. This particular deal on Amazon (4 packages with 6 rolls each) is priced just a little bit better than local retail. When you consider prime shipping and not having to pick these up at the store, the value goes up a bit (normally you pay a price for convenience). I have re-ordered these on Amazon for the past 3 years, probably every 2 months. Great buy.",
                "OK, this is going to sound like the rave of a crazy person\u2014or worse, someone who works for Viva\u2014but I swear it's all true.\n\nI'm not big on brands names. I'm usually willing to give a generic brand a try to see if it's any good. I couldn't tell you what brand of toilet paper I last bought or which orange juice is in my fridge right now. I have a number of brands I like, often a few I absolutely hate, but I just buy the one that's the least expensive at the time I'm buying it.\n\nThere are a few exceptions, and Viva is on that very short list. A friend had raved about Viva and I gave her my speech about how I really don't have favorites of most things, that I try to shop frugally without giving up quality. But the more I used them, the more I liked them. To me, Viva feels more like a very lightweight cloth than paper. They last a good long time when I'm working in the kitchen and I like that they offer the Choose-a-Sheet rolls (what the bigger brand calls Select-A-Size, which is admittedly a much better name). I find I almost never use more than the half-size sheets now.\n\nJust as my friend showed me why she likes Viva, I've done the same with my mother. In fact, mostly as a joke I gave her a three-pack of rolls for Christmas (among other things; don't start telling me I'm a terrible son), but mostly to keep her from stealing them from my pantry when she visits.",
                "When Amazon dropped Viva giant from the sub & save program a month ago I turned to these. I figured they might make a reasonable substitute for roughly $23 per month. What could it hurt, after all these are the same towels just with big instead of giant and with a handy choose-a-size option right?\n\nWrong.\n\n1. They are thinner\n2. They don't hold up as well and tear (compared to Viva original--they will likely hold up better against other brands)\n3. They are rougher slightly abrasive than Viva Giant.\n\nand this was the worst imo:\n\n4. They leave lint--lots of it, EVERYWHERE. On your table, wood surfaces, counters, mirrors, skin -- it's really ridiculous. When you need to re-rinse or look for a no lint towel to wipe up the dusty lint left by the paper towel you just used, then there's definitely a problem. This was very visible especially on my glass table top and mirrors.\n\nWith Viva giant if I needed to do a quick cleanup for say a food drip on a jacket or the kids needed to wipe their hands or face before dodging out, all I had to do was a damp touch up. Big mistake with these towels. What ever you wipe would need to be rinsed off. Lint gets on eyelashes & face and heaven help you if you wiped clothes. Dark or light the lint would then need to be washed or rinsed out.\n\nSilly me I thought choose-a-size meant same towel w/a neat tear line for you to choose a smaller size if you wished. I had no idea it meant choose a cheaper skim-version of Viva.\n\nIf it weren't for that I might say these were a fair substitute but no, the lint was too much.\n\nAs I was coming on to cancel my sub and save of this item I unbelievably found out that after only one shipment Amazon raised the price from the $23 +change that I subscribed to $37 + (with Amazon Mom). Are you kidding me? You introduce the subscribe and save for this last month and change it the next?\n\nIt's bad enough that you took away the best towels and offered this low quality replacement but really...prime is losing its value. Amazon your loyal shoppers deserve better.",
                "These are absolutely horrible paper towels. I do not understand the rave reviews. Perhaps I got a bad batch. I bought a big pack (24 rolls). I wish I could return them. I do not often give one star reviews but here is why this product absolutely deserves my one star:\n\nLet's get the pros out of the way first: Pros:\n* The paper towel adheres to the roll. This makes it easy to grip and pull only as much as you need. (It also tends to 'stick' to other surfaces, see \"cons\")\n* The paper towels are very soft. I guess this is a Pro for some people but not for me. I don't understand why a paper towel needs to be soft since you aren't generally using a paper towel on sensitive areas on your skin. Bath/Facial tissue is understandable, towels not so much. This is a good quality for hand drying towels but that's about it.\n\nCONS:\n* SOFT: Yeah it's soft. I don't get why this is important. The paper towels are soft to the touch like thick toilet tissue and they perform as you would expect thick toilet paper to perform. Notably two problems with the softness:\n\n* They disintegrate and fall apart immediately when wet. This is compounded if you use any cleaning solution. In my household we rarely use anything stronger than a mild water/vinegar dilution and even that causes these paper towels to shred. As you can see from these pictures, these towels were used to clean a microwave and mirror and you can see the horrible lint situation that is left behind.\n\n* Even when dry, they lint badly. Rubbing them against your fingers causes a cascade of dust.\n\n* Clingyness. This was a pro because it adhered to the roll but it's a problem when you are trying to clean something like glass. Regardless if you spray the cloth or the glass first, the paper towel doesn't want to glide across the surface and you generally end up bunching the paper towel up into a ball, causing it to fall apart because of it's \"softness\".\n\n-------\n\nAgain I don't give 1 star reviews often. But these paper towels are not suitable (in my opinion) to use on glass, mirrors, electronics, or anything that you don't want lint all over. Thrift store towels are better. These are marginally better than toilet tissue for cleaning. I have to go behind myself with a feather duster to clean up after these towels. If I could give negative stars for making cleaning duties even worse, I would.",
                "Paper towels, the most used towels in my household throughout the day. We go through at least a roll per day so its important to select a brand that provides the most bang for the buck. In our quest for the ideal paper towel, we've encountered cheap, melt in our hands type and durable, strong as real cloth type. Viva paper towels fall towards the latter type. They are high quality, soft, absorbent and feel like real cloth. They don't melt when they get in contact with water. They are durable and can actually be re-used if needed. For example, after using a towel to dry our hands, we sometimes wipe the sink and/or kitchen counter top with the same towel before throwing a piece into the trash. This allows us to make the most use of a paper towel before discarding it. The ability to \"choose-a-sheet\" also adds to the savings. For maximum savings, we rotate between different brands of quality paper towels and Viva is in the rotation.\n\nIf you haven't used Viva, give it a try. It may just become your favorite paper towel.",
                "I was skeptical because I've always been a Bounty guy and EVERY other non Bounty paper towel I've tried has been a massive fail (Sparkle most recently). So like with Q-Tips (always use the proper Q-tips because the knock offs are terrible always), I have remained loyal to my select a size. But I read good reviews and took a flier trying these out. Glad I did. It literally took me 6 rolls to decide how I felt about them relative to Bounty. I finally think I've decided I like them better. Both are 5 star products. The difference is that Viva is a decidedly cloth like feel vs. an absorbent paper like feel. The Viva are super absorbent and you can wring them out and reuse them (great for a counter spill). The texture is good for a nice napkin, which I need because I don't use napkins. Totally worth a try. You may wind up loving the cloth feel of these and switch. If you don't love it, at least you aren't suffering through terrible quality paper towels you just wish would go away. You'd be using these and still impressed with how well they work.",
                "OMG! We'll Never Buy Paper Rolls Again! At first glance these roles of soft cloth-like sheets appear to be smaller than rolls that boast more sheets and are marketed as jumbo, Giant, etc... When actually while these single ply roles are actually tighter rolled sheets yielding a more capable, more cost-effective product per sq ft. Than Brawny, Bounty, Scott, Great Value, or any other sheet paper product we tried. SUPERIOR for house cleaning! FANTASTIC on the new Glass Top Stoves! SUPERIOR for spill pickups! SUPERIOR ABSORBENCY! SUPERIOR for cleaning car interiors, dashboards ...even armor all application too! Soft enough to clean jewelry with and even apply makeup with! A SIMPLY AMAZING product with ENDLESS USES! In fact, We haven't found a project yet where it didn't come out on top! And no, we do not have any affiliation with the manufacturer other than making a verified purchase here on Amazon! Try it ...It'll replace all those specialty wipes and you'll never buy traditional paper rolls again!\n\nPRODUCT UPDATE: THRILLED with these! Constantly finding new uses! Moisten lightly for GREAT RESULTS on Laptop screens, Computers and Monitors!!! its uses are endless!!! :-)\n\n3 MONTH USAGE UPDATE... We've had to change our 5 STARS rating to 1 STAR due to continued manufacturing defects! We had to send our last case order back and CANCEL our subscribe and save orders on these! Firstly, the manufacturer is aware of a problem with the sheets being so tightly wound on the cardboard core that they have a tendency to crush or deform the core which prevents these sheets from dispensing properly on ANY HOUSEHOLD DISPENSER! Additionally, the third case shipment we received had defective sheet perforations which did not allow for the sheets to tear individually causing a real mess as each sheet would shred in pieces trying to come off the roll! :-(\nWhile we were extremely enthused with the product and its extended uses far beyond that of ordinary paper towels when we received our first case, its just NOT WORTH THE CONTINUED STRUGGLE to attempt to use this product as received defective multiple times! While the cloth like material is a great idea, the manufacturers quality control is terrible resulting in continually defective product being shipped.",
                "These are the only paper-towels I buy anymore! They are extremely durable yet soft enough to clean off an infant's messy face! I subscribe to these every 6 months and I think I end up buying maybe one or two additional single rolls at the grocery store until my next order, but we use paper-towels almost daily. The nice thing about them is that, say I use them to dry my hands, I can use the same paper towel multiple times before I need to throw it away; it is virtually a hand towel. I have used it to clean/scrub table tops/counter tops... and I can use one paper towel to finish an entire table or counter (unless of course it is extremely caked on with food, etc. then may need or just want to grab another one). Overall I think these are the best paper towel available for your money out there. I won't personally buy anything else (and when I use other people paper towels in their homes, I often recommend that that buy these if they don't already, I'm serious, they are that good!)",
                "I slice these rolls in half and use them to make wipes for diaper changes. They are the only paper towel I've ever tried that I would do that with. With the choose-a-size rolls, the wipes rip off in neat little squares--just like store-bought wipes, but without any weird chemicals or alcohol. These wipes are lovely.\nWipes recipe for any moms or dads who found the store-bought wipes were giving their baby diaper rash: 2 tbsp pure aloe vera gel, 1 tbsp Dr. Bronner's castille soap, 1 tbsp witch hazel extract (should be no more than 15% alcohol). Combine with 2 cps freshly boiled water, pour over half a roll of Viva paper towels (cut side down), big rolls, in a sealable container. Let thoroughly absorb, pull out the cardboard roll, and start pulling out your wipes from the center. Happy wiping! (Pro-tip: cut the paper towel rolls in half with a very sharp straight blade knife, sharpening the knife again between rolls. I somehow thought a serrated blade would work better and used that for a while, but that just makes a mess.)",
                "I ordered 6=15 rolls. I received 6=12 rolls. I'm not happy with this substitution!!",
                "I'm a big fan of Viva paper towels. I've been using them for many years. I've tried other paper towels, but Viva's softness and absorption are the best. Other paper towels tend to sop up a spill, these actually absorb a spill. I'm not one to waste paper, so the ability to use a single towel to clean a mess is a huge bonus. I like to use the half sheet towels. If it's a toddler-sized spill, I may have to use 2 half sheets, but rarely more than that. Viva paper towels do leave fibers behind if washing windows, so I do also use super-cheap, thin paper towels (usually store brand recycled paper) for dusting, windows and mirrors.\nI buy these through subscribe & save. The price is always the same or better than at the store and I no longer worry about running out of paper towels.",
                "We've bought Viva paper towels for years now. They're better, in our opinion, than any other paper towel on the market. It took a little while to get used to the choose a size function but it's actually nice to be able to pull off a short piece to clean up small messes. Less waste, towels last longer. Amazon's been a great source and so far has been between a bit and a lot cheaper than buying them at the grocery store plus they come right to the front door.",
                "When I found the Viva towels, choose a size, I was overwhelmed with joy. I have always thought there was such a waste with the other brands and their full size.\n\nMy husband was the first to start to use them instead of regular Kleenex tissues. Then I started. These towels have really saved us money. We have just started on Social Security and a very fixed income, so the additional use saves us much needed money. They also do a great job cleaning both in the kitchen as well as in the bathroom. I am glad Amazon has reduced the price again. When Amazon raises the price to $45 or $55 a carton I can find them at Walmart for the same $33 a case... and both have shipping for free...(I am a Prime Amazon shipper and Walmart has free shipping with a certain amount of purchases).\n\nI cannot say enough about how great Viva is as well as such a money saver!",
                "Just the Best! Got these on sale one time a few yrs. ago at a local store. After I tried them I went back for more, but they were cleared out! From then on out I find deals online and buy in bulk. These will last you a long time! For two people 2pks lasted more then 6 months. Love the pick a size the best. Yes they might leave a little lint but these feel and work like a wash cloth you toss away. I used them to scrub everything, glass stove top with the cleaner using very little 1-2 (2 makes one reg size of others that would tear up before I finished) Spills or in the garage to wipe off the oil on your hands you name it.",
                "I love these paper towels. They are the only ones that I will buy from now on. They are very soft, kind of like a cloth, but thick. I do not need to buy dishcloths or sponges anymore, I have scrubbed with this paper towel. At first I did not because I was afraid it would fall apart, but alas, it did not fall apart even while scrubbing the stove top. You could even use these to blow your nose on, it's softer than some tissues and great to use as a napkin.. I also like the Choose-a- Size feature also. They are expensive, but it is nice to feel a soft, strong paper towel that can take a scrubbing. My husband even likes them and told me to not buy any other paper towels. My mother even liked them. Viva is the superior paper towel by far than any other brand.",
                "Believe it or not, I have had every contractor and customer in my building ask were I got these from as they feel like shop towels and work great. I tell them and they can't believe its from Amazon and the price. These are high quality, better quality than even I expected when I ordered them for the company. Now I order them for my home as well. Absorbency is really good, might be beat by a bigger brand, but still better than cheap ones. Where the difference is, is the strength. it beats all other bigger brand ones by far, it compares to a blue shop towel. May it be food spill, cleaning, killing a spider these are the paper towels to get it done."

                "I think this doll looks kind of cheap and also creepy but my almost 2 year old daughter loves it. The doll doesn't sit well on the potty which is why we bought it but my daughter was so cute feeding the doll her bottle. She was obsessed with giving this doll her bottle!",
                "I bought this for my daughter to help get her interested in potty training. It honestly just annoys me because it\u2019s messy and she needs a lot of help to play with it. The bottle holds more water than the toilet so it overflows. The doll is hard to position on the toilet and doesn\u2019t stay. And it\u2019s hard to feed her the bottle while she\u2019s upright on the toilet. But the water goes right through the doll, so she has to be on the toilet. It is cute watching her try to put the diaper on her (it\u2019s not waterproof, FYI), but she needs help with that, too. She also needs help putting the clothes/hat on. As far as baby dolls go, it\u2019s fine. The pacifier actually stays in the doll\u2019s mouth. Just plan on being involved while playing with this doll and cleaning up after!",

This doll does not function exactly as needed for that method but it was the closest I could find and we made it work.\n\nIn that method, the idea is to give the doll a drink, take her to the potty, pull down her underwear and then have her go potty. This is important so you can train the child using the doll on the proper way to go potty and then what to do if you have an accident. The problem is, as soon as you start giving this doll a drink, she starts to wet.\n\nTo make do, we held her on her back directly over the potty chair while we gave her a drink and then tipped her up into the sitting position over the potty chair. It worked okay but isn't as effective as it could be for the lesson being taught.\n\nPotty training aside, she is a pretty doll with eyes that open and close. She is well made with nice coloring. Her clothing, bottle, and potty chair are all well constructed.",

I can't take a photo because she took it home to Florida with her but I can say she strapped the doll in on the airplane and took her out to hold up to the window so the doll could see they were on an airplane. Pretty cute, huh? Will add the caution that the doll DOES WET so before feeding be sure you are prepared for the water to come out quite quickly. A fun experience.",

I suppose it might have helped her get the idea a little, but really it has just been a fun doll for her to play with, particularly the fact that it can go in the bath and it can go potty. If you are using it for potty training, be aware that the water goes immediately through the doll, so you must have it positioned on the potty to catch the water or the doll will have an \"accident\". I found it difficult to hold the baby, the potty and the dolly, particularly if I attempted to put my daughter on the big potty too. The doll does not sit well on the potty by herself. I actually found it easier to have my daughter give the doll the bottle while I held the doll over the real toilet than to try to mess with the little potty that comes with the doll. However, she has had lots of fun with it and it comes with fun accessories - like the undies, diaper, binky, etc.",
                "My daughter is 2.5 and loves this doll! She is doing some awesome pretend play with her; it\u2019s fun to watch! She sits well, her eyes close when she\u2019s laying down, the pacifier stays in her mouth when you put it in all the way. We have not tested out the drink water and wet feature yet, so I can\u2019t comment on that yet. I gave this a lower score primarily because this baby doll, who you feed with a bottle and who wears diapers, has noticeable breasts! Lumps that actually stick up. I\u2019m disappointed, especially because I trust Melissa and Doug products. I mean, why are boobs necessary on a baby? But other than that, we love Annie.",
                "My daughter loves this doll. I saw a video on it with helping with potty training. If you give this baby water, make sure it's already wearing the diaper or is sitting on the potty that comes with it (as the water just goes straight down). It does not easily sit on the potty by itself, you may have to hold it on there. The bottle is very specific to this baby. If you lose it, no other bottle that I've found will work with it. However, for the price, it's a great doll and my daughter loves taking on and off the diaper. She also loves that it came with big girl panties and a hat (which doesn't stay on the head that good). It's well made, arms and legs move freely. Again, she loves this doll and they go potty together a lot.",
                "Absolutely love Melissa and doug but I should have looked at the description before I ordered it. Overall quality is very good.",
                "This is a sweet, small doll that\u2019s solid but plastic. My daughter asked for a doll that can go in the tub and wet a diaper. This did both for a great price. I did return it for a doll that does #2 as well. But, overall great doll!",
                "Purchased this doll for my 18 month old granddaughter for Christmas as requested by her mom. Didn't pay much attention to what I was actually ordering until it arrived and then I was tickled by how absolutely perfect it is for a toddler. She was delighted with her \"baby\" and was easily able to carry it around and to give it the bottle and pacifier that came with it, and to sit it in the chair-- in and out, over and over, that's what 18 month old's do and she couldn't have been happier. I found a little bag to hold the accessories so they didn't get swept up with the Christmas wrappings, and it was all intact when she left here 4 days later. Whether she will be able to keep the pieces together or not we'll have to see but I'm betting she will have this baby for a very long time. Highly recommend!",
                "I bought a different one for potty training my first child and that one broke quickly. This one seems sturdier. I like that the water doesn't go into the doll unless you squeeze the bottle. That made it easier to not make a mess.",
                "My 2-year old granddaughter is just learning to go potty and really likes her doll mimicking potty-training & diaper change along with eyes that wake & sleep. The water bottle is great except you have to feed her sitting slightly reclined on the potty as the water does go right through her or the cloth diaper if she's wearing it-which they warn does this. The bottle is a little bit big for my little one to squeeze on her own in order to get the water into the dolly. But that's okay. We play with it together if she's using a filled water bottle. When I'm not around she can play with it all as long as the water bottle is empty and still has fun with the non-water play as well.",
                "My pre-schooler loves this baby doll. I wanted an all plastic doll (versus one with a soft cloth midsection) that was more realistic with closing eyes. (I gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to one eye doesn't completely close.) But still a great doll. She is the perfect size for my 4 yr old. With movable arms/legs, dressing her is a breeze. I didn't inform my daughter that the doll actually 'drinks and wets', so we don't use that function and she is still perfectly happy with it. To compliment this purchase, I also bought the Melissa & Doug Doll Accessories Bundle. My daughter was thrilled with both the baby and all of her great accessories! Would recommend!!",
                "My 4 and a half year old daughter wanted a baby doll that she could feed and would go potty, so this looked like a great option and we were happy with the quality of the items. It is a little bit of a juggling act to get Annie to sit on the potty and drink at the same time without falling or squirting, but my daughter enjoyed it. She was heartbroken when we left the bottle on an airplane after vacation because that takes most of the fun out of the set. We have called the airlines, called Melissa and Doug (who do not have that particular bottle available to send as a separate item) and are now experimenting with making our own bottle. My suggestion would be to have an extra bottle in the kit - always good to have a backup with these small toys for small kids. Suggestions from anyone else who has dealt with this issue welcome!",
                "Bought this for my daughter for her second birthday. She enjoys playing with it and it is a great size for her. The main struggle we have is getting the doll to balance on the potty; she has to have my help most every time and now has struggled enough that she brings it to me instantly to get it set-up for her. The doll pacifier is also a little bit difficult for a child to put in the doll's mouth on her own. This is not a problem when we are playing together, but if she is playing on her own, this is a difficult toy to play with 100% at this age. Otherwise, great choice and so glad we chose this doll for her help in potty training!",
                "This is a really, really cute doll - far cuter than anything else I have seen for the money. Her rosebud outfit is adorable. Both my daughters have spent hours bathing her, dressing her, and diapering her. Her dress, velcro-ed up the back, is easy even for a young toddler (18 months or so) to put on. Her hat comes off easily, but goes on reasonably easily, too. The pacifier and bottle are fun accessories. And the little potty is fun, too - but as other reviewers have noted, the \"drink and wet\" aspect of the doll is a little weird. Water goes right through her. But that weirdness as a drink-and-wet makes her absolutely perfect for giving a doll-bath. Water doesn't get stuck inside her. And our little Annie has survived hundreds of baths with no noticeable impact on her face.",
                "It's a cute doll with a sweet face. We love that the eyes close. My 5 year old daughter wanted a baby that had a potty and would go pee. (I didn't want to get anywhere near those Baby Alive dolls since they're so expensive and I can't handle their huge heads and molded plastic hair, no matter how fun they could be!) She's old enough to play with the doll without making a huge water mess, although I've encouraged her to play with it in the bathtub so we don't have to worry about keeping the water in one place! The accessories are nice and the outfit is cute and soft. Pay attention to the size of this doll... 12\". It's really quite small! Despite that, my daughter has had and is having a lot of fun with it.",
                "My 16 month old loves her new baby doll! This Melissa & Doug doll is a great first doll for baby and comes with every accessory you will need. The outfit is high quality and adorable (almost something you'd put on your own child in their size!). My only cons with this doll--the bonnet doesn't stay on too well and the pacifier is hard to keep in the doll's mouth. Other than that, it's wonderful! My toddler quickly figured out how to put the bottle in the doll's mouth and put her on the toilet. We aren't using it for the drink & wet feature yet but we tried it out and it works as expected!"

                "MY CRITIQUE\nCompared to the Gillette Fusion they're more cost effective for me. You see I have a very very coarse beard and moustache. When I shave it doesn't even seem like I shaved. Sometimes I kid myself by saying that my facial hair is like barb wire. Haha. I'm trying to play it off a little bit but it can be seriously detrimental to your self image if you don't learn to have a thick skin or take things too personally. Anyway back to the review. Of course they (the Mach 3s) don't shave as close or as smooth as the Fusion blades but they're the next best thing. And they don't cost nearly as much. They're still sorta pricey as you guys who have a budget can probably attest to. But what makes 'em a bit costly for me is that the blades only last me for like two or three good close shaves. After that they start cutting wimpy again. It's a little more cost effective if I buy them in bulk. That's why I buy the 15 packs. Matter of fact that's what got me sucked in to writing this review for you guys. I need to get some more. And it doesn't help that my skin is not only producing coarse hair it's also a little more sensitive than most men's skin. So I feel razor burn a little more than most men too. And although it's not seriously bad I do feel a little twinge of it every day under my chin.\n\nMY SHAVING TECHNIQUE\nWhen I shave I have to really prepare my beard and face 1st by washing my face and taking a very warm 8-10 minute shower (exclusively on my beard). I know this isn't for everybody but it's better for my really coarse hair. Anyway I wash it of course in order to remove any oils and debris that has built up throughout the previous day so that nothing will impede the cutting of the hairs. The very warm water (not real hot mind you. Just hot enough before it starts getting a little too uncomfortable. That's all.) to soften the beard where the beard can come off rather easily. It may not come off like a hot knife thru butter but it makes the hairs under my sideburns just fall off. And bc my hairs tend to lay flat when I shave I apply a little Williams Lectric Shave pre-shave solution on my dry face after I dry off to supposedly make the hair stand erect. It seems to work a little but I still get a little uncut hairs left. Then after I wet my face I put a few drops of shave oil on my face to help the blade glide more across my face to help prevent cuts. Then I put the shave gel or cream on. Now for me bc I have very coarse hair, especially around my mouth, I have to make two passes. You may only have to do just one and get away with it. I can't. Haha. On the 1st pass I shave with the grain (or in the direction my hair grows) downward for the most part. Upward under my Adam's apple. And then after I shave my whole face I apply a 2nd coat of shave gel or cream and I do a 2nd pass shaving against the grain. I do the sideburns 1st bc their already soft and work my way inward to about 1/2 inch to the mouth. I don't shave my mouth area just yet in order to leave the shave gel or cream on it to continue letting the water absorb softening it more bc it's the coarsest hair on your face. Then I jump to the other sideburn and start shaving inwardly towards my mouth. When I get 1/2 an inch to my mouth I move to under my chin. After I go across under my chin. I move to my neck. But here's where it gets sorta tricky. The hairs under your Adam's apple grow in the opposite direction of the rest of your face so I switch directions there to shave in the opposite direction. (i.e. if you were shaving downward now you go upward. If you were shaving upward on your 2nd pass you shave downward). Now you're almost finished. Double check to see if there are some hairs still uncut. You may have to twirl cut them (bc a one directional cut may not cut the hair) with your blade that is if they're stubborn hairs that don't want to be cut. Now don't be lolly gagging too much here doing that bc your face has just been traumatized with all that cutting and is probably getting inflamed. So you want to turn the faucet on the coldest water settings as soon as you can. And apply it to your face. This is not going to be pleasant. But man up bc if you don't you'll wish you had. Bc this can help your face avoid swelling and bumping up. And nobody wants to see their face all red and swollen and bumpy. Anyway when you're finished you can admire that work of art you just created. If you want to you can even enhance your face with an after shave or some cologne or whatever turns you on. It's your world man. Face it with a smile knowing that you got this.",

                "Gillette really screwed the pooch when they came out with the Mach 3. I remember it clearly I was a young lad in my early 20's when I first discovered the magic and sheer awe of the Gillette Mach 3 blade. I had tried many other shaving devices, disposable, one blade, two blades, 4 blades, 5... 6? Blades? all inferior...\n\nI think it may have been because I was homeless and living in my van but I soon discovered that a simple Gillette Mach 3 blade was in fact so good that one blade could in theory last a lifetime if properly cared for. Gillette must have also had this realization because they quickly moved to stifle the interest in the Mach 3 by coming out with an endless series of supposedly better options. They even tried to make it seem like the Mach 3 was not as good as it really was by adding that stupid moisturizing strip which wears off in about a week or two.\n\nHere is the thing with the Mach 3. Yes, there is a moisturizing strip and yes it will go away after a few weeks of daily use... YOU DON'T NEED IT!. The only reason that strip exists is to inform the user that it's time to change blades but in actuality your blade is perfectly fine. Another thing. you might notice that the sharpness of the blade also diminishes in the first week or two. This is another attempt to get you to purchase more blades. In reality the first two weeks of using a Mach 3 is what I call the break-in period. This is the period where the blade is actually too d@mn sharp! and you cut yourself a lot. After this break in period the blade is perfectly sharp and will continue to be so (as long as you wash it well and clear out the hairs from between the blades) for an indefinite time.\n\nNotice also, how you can never seem to find the Mach 3 on grocery store shelves? They either have it stowed away in the back or they are simply out of stock. This is another attempt to steer you away from this perfectly made product. They do this because they know if everyone gets hip to the idea that the Mach 3 will last forever then they will be out of business.\n\nSo, with that in mind, I just purchased a brand new 15 pack of blades which i just received in the mail yesterday. As it is the case that my 46th birthday is next week i figure that this 15 pack will last me till I'm 60 years old. I have an annual ritual of replacing my blade, not because it needs to be replaced, but simply because I want to support the company that has made the most perfect facial hair cutting product ever made ever.",

                "Im certainly not the most hung man on earth here but this ring fits loosely on my thumb and took a lot of work to get on when flaccid, no chance of sliding it on while erect. That's not the issue though because once in it felt fine and was looking forward to using it, the problem is that the ball is attached to one end of the ring and the other end is not solid, there's a small space between the end of the ring and the ball. I squeezed some blood into the 'area' and it caused the ring to open very slightly and when released this caused a massive painful pinch of the skin that went into that small space. The ball does spin but I don't think that's where the pinch came from like others have said, its from the fact that one end is open. If you're less than an inch in girth i'd say sorry to hear that bro...but this ring may work for you .... if you're thicker than that it probably wont work for you,",
                "I like this decorative, fun, and functional cock head ring...but, that damn ball spins and WILL pinch your prick reversing any benift for wearing it...untill you glue it in place!

It's a bit tooooo tight for me, but I can wear it for a while before I get a bit worried about the backed up blood to my main brain. I am on the larger size, and its pretty damn tight on me, so If you are average or less it should be pretty comfortable.",

Depending on the position, the ring can make for a stronger,harder feeling inside, so some may not like that. This is not something we'll bring out for a gentle night; get it?\n\nFor all you men, my hubby said the \"ending\" is VERY intensified! Right before the \"end\", it gets tight and is slightly painful (at least for him), but I think maybe that's why the feeling is so intense? According to hubby, the \"ending\" makes up for the part right before it!\n\nFYI- Yes, like others have said, you can pinch skin when going up or down...the ball rolls...it's happened...no big deal...he's fine and still happily wears it!",

I keep them everywhere around the house and in my truck. If they're handy you use them... That said, the twin line Plackers are by far the best in my opinion. As you might guess they are twice as effective at removing plaque because you have twice the surface area touching your teeth. I recommend using one for the upper teeth and a separate one for the lower teeth to reduce the amount of bacteria you might be spreading around. I have made a conscious effort to do this and my last two dental visits have shown remarkable improvement before I started to do so. I'm sold on them.",

When I found these floss picks, I was amazed\u2026 One pick will stay intact and last for your entire mouth! Just rinse it after the first go between each set of teeth, and you\u2019ll be good! I prefer to go through each set twice, personally, but anyway\u2026 These picks are seriously like magic. The bag will last you forever, and your dental health will never be better.

They just said I need to floss.), I go to the dentist and they say 'well, these are clean teeth!' darn right - I don't just floss, I use flosser with a handle, and I scrub up and down at least twice on both teeth in the crevice - and I try to get up and down between the actual contact point of the teeth 2 or 3 times.\n\nThe two strings make it 4 passes in just an down and up! AND the two strings grip the side of the tooth and really scrub more - like synergy. To me, it feels great. I fell in love the moment I first used it.\n\nMy hygienist said to skip the Glide stuff from Costco - because it glides! No scrubbing. So I use these type with a handle so I can actually remove gunk and material.\nThis has totally upped that game in one use. I'm thrilled to get so many for such a great price.

                "I could not make up my mind which of two extendable dusters to purchase. So I got them both (since I have a two-story house, it does make it convenient to have a duster on each floor for spider webs!) and am keeping them both. They are similar, but each has a different advantage that I value.\n\nHere are my plusses and minuses, by number of stars, for this duster, the\nEurow Electrostatic Duster with 3 sections extension pole\nand the\nOXO Good Grips Microfiber Extendable Duster\nin a few categories.\nAs you can see, I like both of these dusters!\n\n1. How well does the dust-head work?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The cleaning head is made up of soft filaments. This duster is better at plain old dusting of objects with crevices. For example, we have a set of leather masks hanging on the wall. The very light filaments can be swirled around the masks, fluffing away dust in all the folds and crevices, without in any way damaging the masks. This picks up spider webs and dustballs, but just regular soft dust, in spite of the \"electrostatic\" in the duster's name, is more fluffed into the air.\n***** 5 stars Oxo - The cleaning head is very soft, but the filaments are wider and shorter, more cloth-like, than the extremely soft ones of the Eurow. This makes the Oxo not as good on objects like the masks. However, the Oxo is better on general, and especially on more heavy-duty, dusting. I don't dust as often as I should, so the tops of hanging painting frames, for example, can get quite a layer of dust. The Oxo is better at capturing the thicker dust, rather than just pushing it off of the frames. I don't have a ceiling fan to try it on, but I would think this would work well on dusting the top of the fan blades.\n\n2. How adjustable is the dust-head?\n**** 4 stars Eurow - The head is made with a heavy wire center, rather like a giant pipe-cleaner. This can be bent into a curve or at a soft right-angle, which can be very handy. The wire center is sturdy, though, it's not like you can twist it into a pretzel. And, like a pipe-cleaner, once you've bent it, it takes a bit of work to get it perfectly straight again. (Not that it would make much difference if it isn't perfectly straight.)\n**** 4 stars Oxo - The head itself is not flexible, which, again, can be very handy, especially for more heavy-duty jobs. However, you can easily change the angle of the head using the sturdy button at it's connection to the pole.\n\n3. Ease of extension and adjustability?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The Eurow can go up to 76\", which is a very nice length indeed, especially as it is very light and I have no trouble directing it when fully extended. It isn't long enough to reach the ceiling in the two-story entry-way (without a ladder), but every where else it can handle.\n****+ 4.5 stars Oxo - The Oxo is shorter, extending to 54\" total. I'm only taking half a star off for that because it's length is plenty for most places. The head is heavier than the Eurow's head, but still easy to direct at 54\". However, around anything a bit delicate, the fully extended Oxo, especially as it's dust-catching fibers are shorter, will need a little more care and control.\n\n4. How easy is the dust-head to clean?\n***** 5 stars Eurow - The dust-head doesn't come off the pole, but it is super easy to clean. If shaking it off isn't enough, just run it under the tap. Extending the pole is easy; retracting is easy.\n***** 5 stars Oxo - The dust-head is removable, as it's attached with a snap. You can wash it in the machine, or just swish it around in water or soapy water. Extending the pole is easy; retracting is easy. FYI, you can purchase additional/replacement dust heads:\nOXO Good Grips Microfiber Duster Refill\n\nHappy Reader",
                "The only thing I didn\u2019t like about the duster is that I needed to stop dusting to tighten the extension. Depending on what I was dusting determined how many times I had to stop.\nThe duster did hang onto dust until I got it outside to shake.",
                "I purchased this duster because I needed one (not because I WANTED one..!!!). Just too many surfaces around the house to attract dust and cobwebs. It seems like you always notice a cobweb by the ceiling at the most inopportune times. Having a long-reach duster is almost a mandatory thing. I researched a bit and decided on this one. The pole uses the typical twist-lock action when you extend and retract it. The brush is soft filament and gets into small crevices and spots quite easily without damaging items or knocking things over. Unless you have a multi-story atrium or open loft area this duster is long enough for everything.\n\nIn use, I found it to be quite excellent. The filament brush head seems to displace most dust without problem... although I am not sure that it \"captures\" all of it.!! I think a bit of the dust ends up in the air and settling on lower surfaces, so always start at the top working down. The cobwebs that always just \"show up\" when you least expect it were no match for this brush head. It captured everything with no problem. When I am finished I take it outside and shake it gently to clean the dust out. If there are any cobwebs left on the brush head I run it under warm water in the sink for a few seconds. The cobwebs rinse away easily. Then back outside to shake gently and hang for about 30 minutes to dry. Good as new....\n\nThe main center stiffener of the brush can be shaped by bending if you need to do so to reach into or onto a specific area. An example would be the top side of a high shelf or maybe even the top of the blades on a ceiling fan. Exercise care on the fan blades though,,, those blades can carry quite a load of dust and sometimes appear to be a little \"damp\" or \"greasy\" if you haven't cleaned them in a month or so. Once you bend the brush to fit, it can be straightened out to its original shape with little effort.\n\nOverall, this duster is a good example of a product that is functions like it was designed. I cannot fault it at all. Sure wish I had purchased one of these years ago.!!",

I used it and went out to shake the duster and all I saw was turquoise filaments flying in the air. This product is not something you would want to purchase. I will be returning.

                "Worse than any other extendable duster that I've ever used. I've used feather dusters, extendable wands on vacuum cleaners, cotton-covered dusters, dryer brushes to clean out lint...honestly, ANYTHING would be better than this piece of blue junk. The wand has to be screwed in just right, or it will collapse in length. No matter what you do, the head will not stay in place. You can try to hold the head in place with rubber bands...duct tape...a cloth tied around it. Nada. Nothing works. It will just turn and turn, getting loose dust everywhere, if it dusts as all. Forget using this on an angle- if you bend the duster, it will spin and spin, not stay at the angle you set it at. I tried to dust the top of my kitchen cabinets with this- what a mistake! The duster doesn't hold ANY dust- electrostatic, my foot! A plain microfiber cloth is more electrostatic than this thing. A feather duster, heck, even a SWIFFER HOLDS MORE DUST THAN THIS THING! I cannot steer a potential buyer away from this enough. All this thing does is move the dust into the air and onto surfaces below where you dust- and I do mean ALL OVER those surfaces. I have never been more disappointed in a cleaning product or item. I hate leaving negative reviews, but I have no choice here. Buy anything for extended dusting but this darn thing, but save your dollars and don't buy this. Even if the head stayed in place, it just throws dust everywhere, so I would never suggest someone with allergies or asthma use this. It also has a strong chemical smell out of the packing, and sheds little blue threads EVERYWHERE (as if the dust wasn't bad enough...) After using this, it took me an hour to wipe down all of the kitchen surfaces. I expect some dust to fall down- but there's no excuse for this thing to be marketed as electrostatic and hold not one speck of dust in the fibers. But that's what it does. Horrid...",
                "I have bought several of these types of dusters and none last too long for me. I clean a few houses a week, so mine are used about three times a week for larger houses. The positive was the extension pole, which is very nice and fits on other dusters I've bought. I wasn't crazy about the plastic feel of the fibers (almost like they are recycled from 2 liter bottles, that's the only way I can describe it). They also aren't fluffy, so when you are dusting and the duster is pointed down rather than up in the air, the fibers all fall forward so it's not as conducive to dusting chair rungs and such quickly. As a couple months went by, the fibers do what they all do....get clumpier and stiffer (which means it doesn't flow around delicates anymore) and it didn't pick up dust as well. This would take a longer period of time for those only using it for one house a week, but it didn't last long enough to make it worth it for my purposes. So far, I still prefer quality ostrich feather dusters.",
                "Sturdyness",
                "I wanted a duster with a super- long handle so I could clean my 12 foot ceilings without having to stand on a chair to reach them. This duster does reach my ceilings and the pole feels sturdy enough that it won't bend or fall apart as I am dusting. Many reviewers said the duster trapped all of the dust, but that was not the case for me. There was dust on the duster but plenty of dust also fell to the ground. Also, at least for the initial use, the duster shed. But bottom line, my tall ceilings are now cobweb and dust free thanks to this duster.",
                "Update: It's still holding together well! The epoxy/sawdust mix did the trick!\n\nI clean homes for a living and this is the tool that I use which gives me more grief than any other! Menards used to have a reliable one that would last a long time but they swapped it out for something cheaper. This particular brand was great at first! The adjustable extension pole is a little longer than others I've had and is sturdy and locks in place well. Any new duster is going to shed a bit at first and the fibers will come off when they get caught in cracks and such. Like every other duster that I've had, the duster part of the pole comes loose from the main section because there isn't something solid for it to attach to. So all you have now is a duster that spins around on the top of the pole as you try to firmly dust ceiling fans, baseboards....and anything else. I've now taken it completely off, filled the top plastic section of the pole with sawdust and gorilla epoxy and inserted the top section back in to see if it will make it sturdy again."

                "I almost returned mine because it looked pretty sad. The gummy bears were low in the container and the inside of the container goo streaked. The lid, although having a plastic wrap seal, moved up and down. The bottle came in a box thickly packed with cold pack bags which had defrosted. Why pack gummies, which are normally on open shelves in our stores, in cold packs, I wondered. Were they ready to expire? My husband looked at it and said that Amazon was just using cold packs to try to not have the gummies melt and pack down. Didn't work, but they tried. If you want loose, unsticky gummy bears, try finding them in a store. Otherwise, despite Amazon's best efforts, they may arrive condensed and stuck together in a bottle smeared with gummy goo on the inside. I started a return, but decided to keep them. 4 stars for Amazon's effort.",
                "I have been giving these to my son since November along side a multivitamin (started multivitamin long before). My son stayed sick (he was never sick before school) since starting pre K in July so I went on Amazon searching for something to help! I decided on these and made the right choice, I only give him 1 since he's not 4 yet (will be 4 in June). We started these and in a few weeks I could tell a difference, he will still get sick every now and then but nothing like it was before! I do agree with the other review they didn't look good when I got them all stuck together and gummy stuff on the inside of the bottle but they still work! Cute side note: my son will not eat anything with a face (he wants to hug every thing and be friends) so we have to tell him the bear isn't happy until he's in his tummy!!!",
                "This is the first major change we've had vitamin wise going from a multi-vitamin to those only designed for a specific vitamin deficiency. The bears in this container are not sticky nor have the melted look like some that you may find at the grocery store. The fact that it was ordered during the cold season probably helped with keeping the bears in their proper shape. If you've had L'il critters muliti-vitamins, this is very similar in texture and taste, but is juicier. The texture is smooth and the bears are similar to harder gummy bears like Haribo golden bears when it comes to chewy/hardness. It\u2019s chewier than most fruit snack but is very easy to chew and swallow. My daughter prefers these over the multivitamin because they are juicier. She doesn\u2019t care that it\u2019s healthy for her, but loves the fact that she gets to eat gummy bears daily. Like other L'il Critters gummies, they are loaded with sugar, but I suspect they are the same as a regular gummy bear.",

But I guess I got confused with the size/count of the product and after receiving the package, I saw they were not the big jar I was used to, but the little one. This is my fault, anyways. Overall they are very good. ALSO they came in an insulated box with ice pack, that was a big plus (when it's summer).",

There isn\u2019t a doubt in my mind that this supplement has helped her immune system. She rarely gets sick when she does she bounces right back!\n\nAs per our nutritionist, we give 1 daily. If they are sick or coming down with something. Or if known bugs/viruses are floating in school we up their dose to 2 per day.\n\nTaste is good. Texture is fine. No weird smell. 4 different flavors.\n\nI\u2019ve tried several brands of this \u201cformula\u201d and this was the one my kids liked best. Many others had weird smell or taste.

Obviously it's because of the concentrated juice that is used in each batch but the one thing you can't beat is the price, especially if you get free shipping.

I removed all the nasty interior plastic trim pieces (originally light gray, now brown with smoke stain), laid them in the driveway, and sprayed them with All Clean+. I was prepping my drill brush when I decided to rinse the trim pieces off with the water hose, just to see what would happen. ALL OF THE GRIME CAME OFF! I didn't have to use a brush, just spray and rinse! I'll be buying more soon for cleaning the rest of the truck.\nAlso, I easily removed the sprayer/cap.",

                "We needed a tv stand for our guest bedroom when we ordered the Walker Edison Tall Traditional Wood Universal TV Stand. We could not find one that was assembled, anywhere, and my husband had spent 2 weeks last year assembling a sewing cabinet for me with much cussing and tool throwing! So I did not want to ask him to do that again!! But, alas, after not finding anything I had to! We took a chance and ordered the Walker Edison Tall Traditional Wood Universal TV Stand.\nAfter opening the box and taking a look at all the pieces, he decided to read and follow the instructions. And I decided to leave the room! After 2 days, with NO cussing and NO tool throwing, he had the TV stand assembled! He told me:\n1. All the parts were in the box, including a few spares!\n2. The instructions were PERFECT, NOTHING WAS LEFT OUT, or NO INSTRUCTIONS WERE LEFT TO THE IMAGINATION, EVERYTHING WAS EASY TO FOLLOW!\n3. Every piece fit, as designed\n4. No problems\n5. He would order from Walker Edison again, should we need furniture again!\nI do not know how much better review I could give!\nTWO THUMBS UP!!",
                "This is my 65 in. TV stand. Is very sturdy and fits perfectly with my other furniture.",
                "For the price, this is a pretty decent piece of furniture.\n\nThe good:\nThis looks really nice in my living room. The darker brown of it helps give the appearance of a more sophisticated piece. It also comes with little \"wood grain\" stickers to disguise hardware on the inside to make them unnoticeable on the completed unit. The swing out storage doors were the main thing I was looking for in a TV stand, and they hold a lot of DVDs. Other reviewers indicated that they had damaged pieces but mine was perfectly fine beyond one tiny little scuff that was easily covered with brown marker and was in a spot where it would not be noticed anyway. Other reviewers have also indicated that the build instructions were confusing at times but I didn't feel that that was the case at all.\n\nThe bad:\nEven though the instructions were pretty clear to me, its still going to take a long time to put this together. It took me about 3.5 hours to complete it by myself. The one swinging door sits a little funny (see picture) and bothers me a bit. I'm going to try taking it off and see if I can reposition it. Its not terribly noticeable and it does not hinder the door from opening or closing properly though.\n\nThe ugly:\nIt. Is. Heavy. I'm a small woman so it was very difficult to get this into my house from off my porch. And that was just trying to lift one end enough to pull it over the threshold and then push it in. If you need to get this to another floor of your home, you will either need to be very strong or have someone help.\n\nOverall, with the issues mentioned, I'm still happy with the purchase. It seems to be pretty sturdy, it looks nice, and it has a lot of storage space.",
                "Well this is my second review, my first review was 1 star, due to the fact that it was delivered with no hardware to put it together. Hardware was sent after trying emails for over a week. It took finding and calling a customer service phone number to get the problem fixed. I was able to assemble it without much difficulty. It is solid wood and well made. It works well in my bedroom and has lots of storage space. Would have been 5 stars if not for the missing hardware and lousy customer service.",
                "This a good cabinet, but when it arrived it came in a 5\" long box. At first glance it did not look like it was much but when I tried to move the box that the delivery driver left by my door in the rain and did not ring the bell. So I was in a hurry to get it out of the weather. When I heaved it up it stayed down. This was one heavy box, I man handled it inside and just about hurt myself. this is when I realized that this was not a flimsy piece of furniture.\n\nSo I got my dolly and moved it into the living room where I spent the next 3 days putting it together. Now the cabinet came complete with all you need is a screw driver. They advise against the use of power drivers. But there are some 3\" screws that I would not hesitate to use the driver on. as they are quite tight and hard to screw in. So in this respect I deviated from the directions. They even supply you with the glue for the dowels. Here too I deviated and used wood glue that I knew that once applied it was very hard indeed to break the seal.\n\nAs to the directions they are concise in that each is lettered and the directions guide you to put it together by sections. Each one needed to be placed just so, As I later found as i started to put the sections together. As it does not label them as to what is top or bottom or front or rear. So i found myself diassembling sections and switching pieces around as I found when I went to put them together that something would be upside down or facing the wrong way.\n\nMy eyesight is good but only by squinting and staring at the drawings of each section could I see how each deviated from the other. Thus i was able to get it together. I found the putting the doors together was a 2 person job. As they were the last pieces to go on according to the directions.\n\nAs I got close to finishing it i could not help but notice the finish of the wood and how straight it all came together after i figured it all out.\n\nSince finishing I have received many compliments on the cabinet and beauty and quality of it.\n\nIf the directions had been more concise or the pieces labeled better, thus making this a difficult build I would have given this 5 stars.\n\nAs to would I recommend it, I do not hesitate with a yes. As it is very nice piece of furniture especially for the price. But with the warning to pay very close directions to the drawings, and take your time before gluing, be sure each piece fits as it is supposed to.",
                "Difficult angles to assemble. Took 3 hours. The doors are kind of long and wonky. There\u2019s probably a better one on wayfair for the money.",
                "Ok so this is the second tv stand I purchased as the first one broke. This is a sturdy stand except it is made from particle board. That is fine for the cabinet portion as it is rally heavy mdf material. However at the bottom there are only 3 pieces of mdf to hold the whole thing up!!! One across the bottom of the front and one on each side. These pieces are held on by wooden dowels glued into holes. So when I moved the stand to clean my window and then tried to push it back in place the bottom piece snapped off and I almost lost my tv.....was quick enough to catch it as the whole stand tipped back!!! I have had this stand for about 2 or 3 years. I ordered another because I really liked it but I made a little adjustment. I gorilla glued a piece of 2 x 4 to each inside bottom corner and I mounted 1.5\" wheels so I can move the stand without putting pressure on the bottom pieces. Problem solved!! If you never move it you will have no problems. If you are occasionally going to move it do what I did or don't put the bottom 3 pieces on at all. Thus the 4 stars vs 5. Hope this helps.",

                "Happy with the purchase, looks great in the room. My mother bought this because she is on a fixed income and couldn't afford to purchase one at the furniture store. She was so happy because it looks just as good as some she saw for around $800 - $900. (of course it is particle board and not solid wood, but you cannot tell when you look at it) Some tips for anyone who orders. Assemble very close to where you plan to use it and make sure you assemble on a clean soft surface. You will want to have an electric screw driver and a soft cloth to wipe away excess wood glue. I suggest you get Gorilla Glue that dries clear, that way if oozes out you won't notice it. (all dowels should be glued)\n\nIt took us 2.5 hours to assemble, but I am very cautious and could have probably done it quicker, but I read the directions at least twice to make sure I had things right. The picture directions are good, but not 100% clear when looking at the placement of a few of the pieces that have several wholes.",
                "The product came quickly. And it's pretty heavy and that's good. And a ton of parts to assemble and so it takes some patience to do so. The instructions had plenty of pictures to guide through the process. I got toward the end of it when I discovered a drawer part with a slider attached -- and the slider was attached wrong by the manufacturer! It took me a handful of tries to figure out why the drawer was not lining up right and sliding correctly. LOL. However, I managed to unscrew and then rotate the part -- using the same holes and it worked. I am not sure if it'll keep, but it's a fix that I had to do because the manufacturer messed up. I guess I could have returned the whole thing or made demands of the company.\nIn any case, I am happy with the product - with one less star.",
                "This is solid once assembled and certainly attractive enough for a child's room, den or playroom. The finish, however, is easily damaged.\n\nNow for the assembly: I am a small woman and put it together by myself. First gather patience and count all the parts, including the frame pieces. While putting it together I found that one piece, essentially ornamental, was not drilled properly. Customer service seems good and replacements can be ordered on line (free). Leaving that piece off, I assembled the rest with two sizes of Phillips head screwdrivers. All the hardware was present. Still waiting (next day) for the replacement piece, which I made sure is not essential to install before something else, so I'll add it when it arrives.\n\nSuggestion: Disregard instructions that say to insert the cam locks into the holes first, as it is much easier to join parts and then insert and lock the cam locks. Apply glue sparingly, though there is plenty of it furnished. Make sure dowels are sunk into the holes fully. Also make sure the parts fit tightly together before locking the cam locks. Screws will strip easily, so be careful. Ignore the step where it says to put the top on before the cabinet doors - it's easier to install the doors before the top. The top is the heaviest part and as mentioned, the finish is easily damaged in case the cabinet needs to be laid down to do the doors, and it is easier to install the doors with the cabinet lying on the back. I used one of the foam packing pieces on the floor to protect the finish.\n\nWhile it did take all day for me to assemble this, I proceeded slowly and carefully and ended up with an attractive cabinet that suits my needs quite well.",
                "I\u2019m very happy with this purchase. It is extremely heavy and sturdy. The one thing I struggled with was the doors. The instructions weren\u2019t 100% clear on applying the hardware, after several attempts I ended up using longer screws because I didn\u2019t apply the hinges properly and messed up the wood. Fortunately, the hinges hide my mistake. Once I got it right everything worked out quite well. My suggestion is make sure you get the hinges on right the first time. All of my pieces were in good condition when it arrived and they sent extra parts in case they were needed. Very happy with my purchase.",
                "So let's start with the positive:\n\n1) AWESOME TV stand.\n2) The quality of the wood is superior and the styling is great! In my instance it holds, a 47\" LED, 2 speakers, cable box, Blu-Ray player, XBox 360, and wii.\n3) Assembly is pretty straight forward. Took about 2 hours from un-boxing and organizing all of the parts and making sure I wasn't missing anything, to getting it all setup.\n\nNow to the negatives:\n\nInside the doors, it doesn't hold a whole lot and this is the reason why; the door hinges aren't made to hold a whole lot of weight. I originally started loading all of my DVDs in the stand, but after loading them onto the door and shut it, you can clearly see a big gap from the left to the right on the door from the weight of the DVDs. I had to buy a DVD stand which now holds all of my DVDs since it can only hold as many as you can fit in the stand itself (not on the inside door). Thus adding more expense which really shouldn't have happened if they had better hinges to hold the proper weight.\n\nI've tried putting little rubber \"buttons\" on the bottom of the shelf and lifted up on the door when shutting so the door would sit on the button, but that didn't do anything. Plus, it was one more thing to think about when going to get a DVD, making sure to lift up or the button would become unstuck to the bottom.\n\nSo for that reason, I have to rate this at 4 stars for the following points:\n\nStyle: 5 stars\nDesign: 3 stars\nEase of assembly: 5 stars\nFunctionality (for me): 2 stars (due to not being about to use the interior compartments besides the external shelves)",
                "I like it\nFor my living room\nIt\u2019s perfect exactly what I was looking for",
                "I have ordered this and one of the part broken when i told to replace they told its back dated and could take a month or so. it took me to 3 hours to assemble this and door was a tough part, and they said you can return if you don't like . first thing it was too small, and could not give a good look. I would not recommended this."

They are reasonably priced for what they are and compared to the other options in this category. The reason they only received 5 stars is that they do not \"fan out\" enough and therefore are more prone to leaking than say an O.B. traditional no-applicator tampon.

I originally purchased these at my local grocery store on a whim in super size. I tried them out and was floored at how much less I bled!!!! I decided to order them online (cheaper) and the regular size instead since I barely even soaked the super size. I recommend these to EVERY female. If you want to do something safe for your body then spend a little more and get something that actually lasts longer (no bleed outs) and you use less of them because you don't over bleed them.

                "Love this cleaner for my granite countertops, but the refill gallon was missing about 1/3 of a gallon of cleaner. It didn't leak, it wasn't open. Not sure I'll order it from Amazon again.",
                "Great granite cleaner and no chemicals . Smells great. Not a strong smell very subtle.",
                "I think this product meets all my expectations. I have dark granite and water spots and greese spots wipe away.",
                "I have white quartz counters and a marble table. I use this daily so the refill bottle is a must",
                "I use nothing else on my granite countertops. It also does a nice job on the glass cooktop.",
                "Cleans very well. I was surprised at how well this works. Nice scent, no chemicals. Pet safe! Spray and wipe. I love all of the Better Life products I\u2019ve tried.",
                "I bought this to clean three headstones (grave headstones) that had not been cleaned nor swept nor touched since 1982. Yes, that's 37 years of moss leaves and bird droppings. Within 10 minutes, the headstones looked brand new! And I didn't have to scrub. Just use a soft rubber bristle brush and spray this product. I will say that I did rinse afterwards. The product says no rinse, just wipe. But I think that's for indoor counters. For my outdoor rough element surface, I felt rinsing just helped get the crud out of the engraving. The shine is amazing and not one leaf outline or bird dropping remained. It's been 2 months since I cleaned the headstones with this product and nothing sticks to the headstones. They look as if I cleaned them yesterday. Highly recommend. If they can clean outdoor granite that hasn't been touched in 37 years, it can clean your counters!",
                "I love this product! It works great but I will say, I don\u2019t love the scent. It doesn\u2019t last too long though and it leaves my marble counters clean and streak free so I\u2019ll tolerate the smell but I\u2019m hoping at some point they will come up with an alternate scent.",
                "Love a nice smell but hate those ridiculously strong smelling cleaners like Mrs. Meyers (instant migraine for me), this smells good when you use it but doesn't overwhelm the whole house. Does a nice job getting the counters nice and spotless.",
                "Great product! It does leave our granite counters shiny and it smells great which to me means doesn\u2019t smell like some nasty chemicals. It also doesn\u2019t make me feel bad for using cleaning products since it\u2019s all natural ingredients. The only thing is Amazon doesn\u2019t seem to sell just the refills so I went to check out the sellers site and the refills are much cheaper there which allows me to reuse the spray bottles and save money.",
                "I had a subscribe and save order for this product since August 2021 when we had our kitchen renovated. I wanted a quality product to keep our new granite countertops clean. All was well for a few months until one shipment changed. The product was the consistency of thin white glue and was completely unusable. Sine then subsequent shipments consisted of inferior product, almost always leaving a dull haze over the granite. I have cancelled my standing order. What was supposed to be a quality product turned out to be junk.",
                "Wow, I love, love, love this!! While I prefer green products, I am an average mom, that always seems scattered and in a hurry, since I forgot to place my order for more take it for Granite, I decided to purchase something else at a big box store ...... Can I say BIG BOX MISTAKE!! The product they recommended left streaks all over my counters, filmy, blurry film and it certainly isn't green. My husband thought something greasy was on the counter originally causing the other product to streak, and then I took out the tiny few drops of take it for granite that was still left in the bottle and put them on the counter .... Wow, what a difference!! I'm not a photographer (other than mamarazzie) but I tried to capture the difference to show you. The other product I had to use a super soft cloth to \"buff\" the counters ..... Yes, \"buff\" the counters .... I don't have time for all of that! Give me a paper towel and some take it for granite and I'm done now & I feel good about it! I will be buying this as house warming gifts from now on!! <3",
                "Does a great job!",
                "We love this cleaned! The scent is amazing, not too strong. It truly cleans the messes and loving the value for our money. It\u2019s cheaper than what we were paying for, but better quality. We already ordered two more after using our first bottle. Our first bottle lasted us about two months, and my wife cleans the counters daily, sometimes twice a day.",
                "One bottle was thick and whitish, the other was clear and worked great.",
                "It smells great and leaves my granite shiny and clean.",
                "Better Life Natural Granite and Stone Cleaner not only smells wonderful but does a great job, too. I used to stingy with my other counter cleaner because it was so expensive. BLN is far more economical and it doesn't send a million chemicals into the air when I use it.\n\nThis was my second order so it appears I'll be a lifelong customer!"

Husband tends to buy that brand and I always buy the soft kinds of brands or wipes and so when I bought these because we were out of toilet paper I was very surprised that both the quality of the layers and the price and how long they last! Play we don\u2019t have shortages again anytime soon but if we ever do this is a brand to stock up on! I believe this brand works to make things environmentally friendly.",
                "Soft? Yes, very. Almost like an ultra soft facial tissue. In fact, I started using it as that after buying a toilet paper that holds up better. This will fall apart very quickly. If you have a skin disorder, or a baby, or are extremely sensitive to texture, you'll like this. But be warned, it will fall apart quickly when faced with fluid, which then makes it not a value purchase. I used twice as much of this brand toilet paper than others. While I support using post consumer paper in the recycling process, I have had better. In fact, this was substituted for a 365 brand I had purchased. I won't be buying it again - unless there is another TP shortage due to (censored) panicking or taking advantage of others in a crisis situation.",

And, TMI, I\u2019 I\u2019m sure, but sometimes when I shower and go to wash, I find little pieces of it stuck there! Can\u2019t do it. I like Whole Foods\u2019 \u201cSustainably Soft\u201d TP.",
                "This is just middle of the road toilet paper. It's not as thin as gas station stall paper, and not as thick and soft as charmin. It was $4.50 for a 4 pack when I got it, so it was mostly worth the price then.",
                "Seventh Generation used to be my GoTo brand for bath tissue and paper towels. But the current version of tissue is totally useless. It disintegrates on contact with moisture; Even using doubled (4 layers) or tripled it tears, frays, leaves lint stuck to you and fails miserably to perform its purpose. The \"quilting\" imbossed texture is a sham: it just makes the rolls look fatter and \"fluffy\" and shred more easily. The perforations are hard to see and half the time they fail to tear cleanly, so that bits and pieces and shreds result insteat of a neat tear. About every other roll begins with 2-3 yards of unuseable tissue, because of the way the end in glued through multiple layers, and for some reason also the 2 plies are offset by a couple of inches, so that one tears at the perforations and the other just shreds between the perforations. Lastly, it has some kind of fragrance added, apparently to the cardboard roll. The paper towels have similar problems (a separate review) and I will not buy Seventh Generation tissue or towels again.",

It's kind of stiff and unyieldy so it doesn't break-up properly and I had a long overnight shift of 'treating the toilet' last weekend, wasted a whole weekend basically dealing with it.\n\nThen tonight when I was looking at the roll we had been using, yep last of that pkg (got 3) and it's plugging again. (Had used some other rolls intermittently since this was purchased and no trouble with them at all.) So, now it's more than obvious that the stiffness is blocking up the semi-industrial toilet and whatever savings I had were lost in having to buy so many supplies to unplug it myself and the hours lost from all the other projects I needed to do and having to use other people's restrooms. The pkg says it's safe for different and even low-flow toilets but that's just not possible. I'm going to ask them to take the other 2 back, it's not worth it.",
                "Fine product, soft tissue, good for septic systems - but...you don't get a lot and it is expensive. For a single person household its fine, 2 or more people and I have to go with something more affordable, less refills.",
                "This toilet tissue is truly subpar. It's coarse and looks unappealing. The individual rolls are softer and last longer. I tried to save a little $ by ordering this pack, but it was not worth it. These rolls were of poor quality.",
                "I don't know where to begin with the joy this product has given me. It's truly been a blessing. Every time I use it, I feel relieved.",

This came wrapped in a plastic wrap which means there is 0 chance another customer possibly opened it to smell it or squirted some out to feel the texture. So for that, I thank the seller! Will definitely purchase again. For the product, I have oily skin that breaks out with acne. This has been a game changer for me. Helps keep my face clean and oil free while smooth at the same time. It has a cooling effect too which feels refreshing. Love it and highly recommend this product and seller!",

I try to get the cap off but it was not budging at all. I wasn\u2019t about to break it and ruined the whole container. It has a lot to do with the fact that there are abrasives that can collect in the dispense nozzle. Despite that, I do like the product.",

It removed the oil and dirt on my face and kept my face dry for the whole day. I like that it foams and the menthol penetrates into my skin. It doesn\u2019t burn but has a cooling effect. It may seem expensive but you only need a dime-size on your hand. Lather it up with your hands and apply to a wet face to foam it up. You\u2019ll be amaze by the results. This was recommended by my wife. (I know I should start listening to her. Lol)",

It is nice and moisturizing and smells good. I still have to use a moisturizer because I have dry skin and it\u2019s best to use a moisturizer after cleaning face especially at my age.

These diapers have been great on her little bum and can get her through a six or seven hour stretch no problem. They do smell though- its a baby powder scent that's a bit on the chemical side. We've gotten used to it.\nI had wished these came with the wetness indicator strip but now that I've been using them I can easily tell just from the feel if its been soiled or not. We will probably buy these in the next size up.",
                "Fantastic! My son has had some pretty big messy diapers but not once have we had a leak!! Very happy with Pampers Baby Dry diapers. We went from Pampers Swaddlers Newborn to Baby Dry size 1. With the cost savings I wanted to give them a try and they work great... Good gathers around the legs and the are snug at the waist, especially the backside. There have been some 'oh boy' moments - anticipating a leak but NOPE! My only wish is if they could have the color line indicator for wetness but I can actually tell by looking for that telltale yellow front or back (he's breastfed). It's easy to see through the outside plastic and see if you have a full diaper. Two thumbs up!! I will definitely reorder. We are 3/4 through a case and have been using them for a month.",
                "This diaper is very economical and does what it needs to do. It doesn't have the wetness indicator but you can feel or smell for yourself if the diaper is wet. Because of its thinness, you can also see clearly when your baby poops. I prefer the diapers with the wetness indicator. This one does what it needs to do; there's nothing fancy about it. If your baby has a sensitive bottom, though, I would recommend using another type of diaper. There's a reason this one is cheaper than the others.",
                "It's no surprise that the product is a good product because I was using it prior to subscribing to it through the Amazon Mom program. The downfall was that my son outgrew the size I ordered before I even opened the box. I was excited to have it arrive on my doorstep with very little effort on my part and should have been more careful about the size I was ordering. Returning it isn't an option at this point because shipping is my responsibility and will cost much as the box is large. So I will donate it to an organization that can give to a mom in need. So for future Amazon Mom subscribers, babies grow overnight, be careful what size diapers you order.",
                "I first tried these when my son was 4 weeks old. Pampers SWADDLERS are MUCH better. I bought a huge package of these and I wish I hadn't. First of all they always leak. My son will fill up one of these diapers in no time and he always leaks pee out the sides and up his back. Second, because they don't hold much liquid, his poops also spill out. They leak poop up his back and around his legs (and he does not have skinny legs. He was born 9 pounds.) The diapers aren't that soft either and they have caused my son to get diaper rash. I assume its due to the fact that they're not very absorbent and that they're not that soft. I absolutely hate these diapers. I usually like Pampers brand, but I have huggies and Luvs diapers that I like better than these. I plan to just send them to his daycare and let them deal with them and I'll use diapers I like better at home.",
                "As a new mom, I've tried couple of different brands,, and Pampers is the winner. For this specific one, it's great for the cost, but it does not come with wetness indicator... which is something you can live without.. but the ones with it, help quite a bit. But can't complain when you have to change diaper like 12+ times a day, the cost comes as a big player in purchasing such items.",
                "I purchased these primarily for the price, but they are a decent diaper. I am using them for my newborn who requires frequent changes. She has had no leakage so far. Overnight, which so far is a max if 4-5 hours, they hold the urine well. They do not blow up when saturated like some other diapers do. I would buy again, especially with the subscribe and save. Great deal!",
                "Amazon ships these to us automatically which I highly recommend. Pampers are our favorite. They are very soft, well made, and can hold a LOT of pee. Our 5 month old can sleep through the night without waking up for a diaper change in these and only these diapers. The don't sag the way some of the others do. Did I mention how soft they are? I have no idea why some diapers out there are made out of the hardest crunchiest paper ever but these feel like they are made out of fabric. LOVE pampers!",
                "Ok, these diapers are getting 3 stars because they HAVE held in what they're supposed to hold in. However, I really hate the texture of the diapers. They are \"plastic-y\". I LOVE the Pampers Swaddlers because they are soft, almost fabric-feeling. I bought a huge box of the Baby Dry kind because they were a few bucks cheaper, and thank God we are almost out of this box because I hate the plastic texture of the diaper. I guess that's just personal preference since they seem to perform just fine, but I prefer to have a soft little baby butt when I hold my little one, not a squishy plastic butt!",
                "I was worried about these diapers. I read the reviews AFTER purchasing them. There is no elastic on the back like other diapers I've used so we've had about 3 blowouts that came out the back of them. Most of the time they have worked just fine. My son is a big piddler and he has never leaked through these diapers.",
                "These diapers are good - nice Sesame Street design, pleasant odor and good size. The one drawback is that they don't have the wetness indicator stripe in the front that I have seen on other Size 1 diapers. There are other Pampers size 1 diapers that still have them (Snugglers, perhaps?), so I'm not sure why they didn't include them in this bulk size.",
                "I like these diapers better than the swaddlers. The swaddlers have a mesh in the diaper that would stick to my sons bottom. These pampers are good as far as leak protection, but you can feel when the diaper is wet or poopy. The diaper gets warm or cold to the touch.I would recommend them for the price and quality.",
                "We like these diapers, they fit our daughter well, prevent leeks, and are easy to change. However, it's a little difficult to use a product when you don't receive it. In place of our 276, size 1, Pampers, we received 180, size 4, Luvs. Very disappointed, especially since they were sold and shipped by Amazon. The only thing correct was the product type, diapers. Brand, count, and size, were all incorrect. At least they were packaged nicely.",
                "I purchased these for my sister in law's baby shower and they were a big hit! I made these adorable diapers into a 4 layer diaper cake and had plenty more to spare. I trust the pamper brand name and so I was glad that I was able to give her a functional and yet presentable gift. My family has always bought Pampers and I'm glad we can continue this tradition with the next bundle of joy.",
                "I love pampers but these diapers are just not that great. We seemed to have a lot of blow outs with these. They just do not seem to be made as nice as their other diapers. In my opinion it is worth spending the few extra dollars and getting the pampers swaddlers! They just seem to fit a so much better, hold more baby surprises:), and have the wetness indicator which as an exhausted new mom is a really nice thing to have!",
                "I like these diapers, they're easy to put on a squirming baby. I like that the swaddlers have a wet indicator, but those aren't available for Amazon Prime, so I went with these. No real complaints, I can usually tell when my baby needs a change without a wet indicator.",
                "I am a new mommy, but I have learned really fast what diapers work and which ones don't. I love Pampers! The Baby Dry have been great, except that they are lacking the stripe that turns blue when baby is wet. The line is super helpful; it made us realize (after using non-line diapers) that our son was wet ALL THE TIME, which was causing a lot of his fussiness. Otherwise, they are great! No leaks!",
                "BEWARE!!! Just because the box looks like Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max Diapers, these are NOT the same. My son is now 5 mo. old and we've been using Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max diapers since he was born (you know, with the blue wetness indicator on the front). However, these are NOT Pampers Swaddlers Dry Max. These are thinner, do not have the woven material inside the diaper and are not nearly as absorbent as the Swaddlers. My son has leaked out of his diaper the last 5 nights... these diapers simply are not absorbent enough to contain a night's worth of pee. We rarely had this problem with Dry Max. I won't be buying these again- they simply aren't worth the very little cost savings.",
                "I have two main complaints:\n1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...\n2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).\nAnyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.\n\nThis review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service. I think Amazon does a fantastic job with that. All shipments arrived before the stated arrival dates with no problems at all!",
                "I like pampers diapers. These hold pee very well but not so much poop. My daughter is breastfed so it is kind of watery and with the baby dry diapers, it wouldn't soak it up and would run out of the back of the diaper. They also made my daughter break out with a rash. Overall I wouldn't get these again. Go with the Pampers Swaddler diapers."

That's been my experience.\nThe quality is alright a bit rough and the width is narrower than some other brands. These rolls are probably well suited for a business. As I mentioned the tissues are on the rough side. The rolls are individually well wrapped. Which is a good thing. The rolls last awhile too. The roll that I started with was actually hard to start unrolling as the first sheets were glued tight. Just be aware of that.\nThe last big box of bath tissue that I purchased were Brighton. The sheets were were larger, softer, lighter colored. Much softer than Torx, and the rolls were easier to start.\nTorx are a good value, but I will likely go back to Brighton.",

I had worked in a dry cleaners before, and remembered that there was a device that we used to button shirts quickly(100's per day). So I searched Amazon for a buttoning hook I came across a few options. I was worried about quality if I purchased something inexpensive, and I didn't want it to be flimsy, so I looked for the one that seemed to be the highest quality and usefulness. I sent it to him 8 months ago, and he said it was thoughtful and that was that. Today, seeing him again for the first time since I sent it, he cried(actual tears) about how much he appreciated the gift and how he uses it every day. He was bothered by not being able to do simple things himself anymore, and I was really taken aback by how much this simple device helped him. I would suggest a buttoning hook for anyone having issues with buttons, it's really a life changer, and I think this one is a solid top-notch piece.\n\nHe also told me a story about his trip back from Ireland in August where he was stopped by the TSA and had to show them what it was and how he used it. He got up in front of all of us to tell the story showing us what he showed them, buttoning his pants and shirt. He was chuckling and laughing the entire time. Only bad part is that I have no idea what gift I will get him that will ever follow this up....maybe take his daughter off his hands?",

I have another device that makes shirt buttons a snap to close but it is made of thin wire and will not work to pull heavier buttons like those on jeans and other pants through the button holes. This device has four tools that fold up like a pocket knife. The large hook on the end will pass through the button hole and grab the thread behind the button and pull heavier buttons through the hole with ease This really comes in handy when you want to wear pants. Sometimes a zipper may get stuck down at the bottom after the button is closed and it is difficult to release without reopening the button. This device has a small hook that can reach through the hole in the zipper and with one quick tug it will release the stuck zipper and help to pull it up. This is the first device that I have found to help with those heavier buttons. The tools for small buttons work fine too. But I prefer the lighter weight wire device puller for shirt type buttons.",

We were not with him at the time, so we could not help: TSA could not understand what this device was for and ordered him to remove it from the package then and there and demonstrate it. Since he did not get around to this beforehand, under the stress of the moment he just told them to throw it away.\n\nIf you buy this for someone who needs it, please take the time to go over how to use it with them, take it out of the package and practice a bit, and don\u2019t gift it right before they have to leave on a flight.\n\nAs for the manufacturers of this product: Some elderly are traveling with only their carry-on, so maybe you need to set something up with the TSA so they can become familiarized with it, so this total waste of what could have been a very helpful tool for the physically challenged does not have to happen again.",
                "A superior tool! I was highly impressed with the quality of construction, the fit, and the finish. Every time I pick it up, I marvel at it. The pocket clip can be mounted on the other side of the handle (with Torx type fastener bit) for left or right handers should you want to carry this in your pocket, although the clip itself is too thick and is very stiff for easy use. Best to forget about clipping this to your pocket anyway. The large button hook is indeed perfect for buttoning jeans or heavier fabrics. The key to using the hooks is to rotate the hook device just as it enters the button hole to then get the edge of the button out of the button hole for a quick and easy fasten. The instructions on the back of the package clearly show this rotation technique, which makes the fastening process very quick. I have purchased another of these for my mother who has arthritis in her hands. This tool is more than worth its price. Recommended for anyone who has difficulty grasping buttons and zipper pulls.

I\u2019m keeping this in hopes that it will somehow prove useful or might try to return. First, it is sturdy and well built. However, it doesn\u2019t help much as a dressing aid. It should have a locking mechanism for the various tools. They tend to fold back up. You purchase this because you have decreased dexterity, but it requires excellent dexterity to use.\nUnable to return!",
                "This seems to be a very good copy of the original Pocket Dresser. I've had a few of these in the past, but this is the 1st by Vivi for me. It's made exactly like the original & quality has not suffered.\nFor me, the large hook for the top button on pants is the only blade I ever use. BUT!! I'd be lost without it because I've never been able to get any other button tool to work on jeans & that's all I ever wear.\nOne little mod I've done to this & my other ones is to take a small S hook & crimp it to the strap. Then I hook it in the finger hole when the blade is open. Depending on your disability, this may not be necessary, but I had trouble with the blade folding into the handle when I was trying to button my pants. I cut off some of the hook to make it easier to unhook from the blade.\nThis is about the 4th or5th one I've bought. They never wear out. I keep leaving them in public rest rooms & when I remember & go back, they're gone already.",

                "Really like this toy.. only used 3 or 4 times so far but great experience! its the perfect amount of hard while still having a little bit of softness to make it pretty lifelike. The vibration is ok. Nothing special, nothing bad to say either. its powerful enough, a little more power would be nice but again at this price range this is already exceeding expectations.",
                "i just received this 3 days ago and the last 3 days have been amazing Its big and girthy like I like it its so soft and the texture is so life like the real thing I have to use my Butt Plug to open me up before I can use this I need alot of lube but the thrill is so amazing especially when it hits my prostate I came hands free the second day i used it I would definately would buy again Today after 3 days of jamming my ass its so happy and now im used to it being so big and girthy I just love it",

It\u2019s super squishy and hardly firm enough to use. It had a weird texture/film when I first took it out of the package. After cleaning it, it seemed to go away, but still off-putting. The vibration at the highest setting is lame. And the difference between high and low and is hardly noticeable. I used it once and there are cracks already starting to show and the base looks like it\u2019s going to come off.\n\nI would be SHOCKED if this lasted a month.",

From some of the reviews describing it as \"huge\" and \"enormous\", that's what I was expecting. While it's a bit bigger than my wife's first vibrator, it is pretty much a match to my own size and girth and as a result my wife handles this dildo without a problem.

                "As far as inexpensive blackout WHITE curtains go these are pretty great! They're not 100% light blocking but they get the job done, my husband must be part vampire and I'm more of a light and bright type so these are a happy medium \ud83e\udd70 we previously had black blackout curtains and are currently doing some small renovations and redecorating and I couldn't stomach the total darkness anymore so I bought some beautiful linen curtains and white sheers and because they barely shielded our massive living room window from the very hot Oklahoma sun, it not only put a horrible glare on our TV but our window ac unit could not keep up with cooling our very small living room anymore and because I loved the look of the new curtains so much I devised a plan to keep them but had to figure out how to also stop the sun from beating through with such force It could potentially cause spontaneous combustion which is where these come in. I bought a tension rod measured the inside of the window and scoured Amazon for 2 straight days looking for something to fix the problem without taking away from the look of my very light new curtains and something as absolutely cheap, without being cheap, and these fit the bill!!! If you're looking for 100%blackout you'd probably get that with the black or another very dark color of these but I needed a light color and therefore knew it's next to impossible to achieve vampire mode without spending a small fortune. These are very light weight and thin but still do a pretty good job so I'm confident in recommending them. The pictures are at 7:30 am before the sun really starts beating down on our window and the light is off so in the first picture all curtains are closed, the second one is the blackout which are behind the curtains you see are open, and the 3rd is outer curtains open and 1 blackout closed and one open so you can seethe differences, and the dark strip across the top of the window is our feeble attempt at blocking the light without having to buy curtains so we bought window tint which definitely helps but it was not the darkness we needed in order to go window naked so we're currently in the process of trying to find a better quality tint that allows us to see out but nobody see in, however I will say that the tint coupled with these blackout curtains are a good combination, if you made it this far thank you for reading, I apologize for the lengthy review but I wanted to give you an idea of what to expect as I find it quite frustrating when people leave vague reviews like \"it was okay\" or \"these are terrible\" I read a lot of reviews because buying online is scary and I want to know why it was good or what was not so good so I do hope this review is helpful to someone \ud83d\ude00 also my window measurements INSIDE THE FRAME are 52 in length by 75 in wide and I got 2 of the 54 in long white panels which fit perfectly\n\nAlso I purchased these in the lime green and they are a really fun bright green which gave me the pop of funky color I was looking for in my very black and drab bedroom",
                "Overall I'm happy with these. I bought Ruby and it looks slightly more pinkish-red than the pics, but still very pretty. These have a white* thermal lining, which I wanted, not the black lining of most \"blackout\" curtains available on Amazon these days (I've tried several!). And they're not super-super heavy like all the other \"blackout\" curtains I've tried lately that are \"3 layers\" woven with the heavy black lining. These seem to be doing a very good job blocking light and heat (I need the heat reflection properties most). Although these are not supposed to be 100% blackout, they're more blackout than the so-called 100% blackout curtains I've tried recently. I'm not using them in the bedroom (where I do NEED 100% blackout), so don't need 100%, but I think these would likely work in the bedroom. The length seems accurate, though I haven't unpackaged and hung them all yet to double check that they are all the right length. Did not notice any stitching/construction problems/irregularities (again, haven't yet looked at all of the panels I ordered). There's no awful chemical smell, even with the curtains getting very hot hanging on a very sunny south-facing window.\n\nThose are all problems I've been having with other so-called blackout curtains I've been trying that I'm NOT having with these, which seems miraculous. They were also quite inexpensive.\n\nMy only real concern is trying to wash these because of the stiff, plastic-y material (especially the \"foam\" thermal liner backing). I've had similar thermal-backed Eclipse curtains over the years, and even though they are supposedly washable/dryable, sometimes they have kind of fallen apart when washed (bits of lining comes off) or the lining sticks to itself... so, I may not try to wash them (that goes against my nature!). They are quite wrinkled, even after hanging for a few days, so I might try to steam them rather than risk washer (cold) and/or dryer (low) for wrinkles.\n\nThese are definitely not gorgeous, soft, flowy curtains, but no blackout curtain is. They do have some nice texture and are matte-finished, unlike all the weird plain super smooth and \"shiny\" blackout curtains I've tried during my search over the past couple of months. And these Ruby curtains are much nicer looking than most of the drab or weird-looking grey/beige/brown blackout curtains commonly available online.\n\n*[Update note: after opening my remaining panels--all are Ruby red, I discovered the white thermal back lining is actually slightly pink on some of them, though it does not at all look like these were previously used/washed. I'm not sure why/how the white lining turned a bit pink. I'd prefer the backs were all really white for better heat reflection, but hope these slightly pink ones will still work well.]",
                "I used this to separate rooms in a doorway instead of a door. It's great and I love it it does the job!! It's thick enough. You can spray some water on it to get the wrinkles out and pat and a run you hands through it like an iron with just water and your hands. I would not use an iron on this material it could melt or if you do use a towel over it and iron on very low . It's real lifesaver . We moved into a place with no door. It helps with privacy and I bought a short one so the cats can go right under it with out have to worry . They walk under the drapes and air circulates under it. I almost didn't buy this place because the was no door on the bathroom and I'm not handy.",
                "These are a great value and an excellent choice if you need to keep your home cooler in the summer and warmer in the winter. They're also ideal if you need to shield your bedroom from outside light, to get a good night's sleep (or if you're napping during the day).\n\nSo far, we've only used these drapes in the summer, and in bay windows that receive the afternoon sun. Since summer 2022 was beastly hot, we needed all the help we could get, to keep our a/c bills low and our apartment comfortable.\n\nFrom our tests, it looks like these lower the room's temperature about 15 degrees (F), compared with no curtains on the window, just thin plastic blinds.\n\nAlso, these drapes are made from fabric that looks nice. The ivory color brings a touch of elegance, and the workmanship is pretty good. Some of the stitching may not bear close scrutiny, but I'm not sure why a visitor would be looking that closely anyway.\n\nFor the price, I think these drapes are a really good deal. We may buy more for other rooms, not for insulation, but simply because they look so nice and keep excess light out.",
                "They\u2019re the exact shade of pink I wanted but as you can see from the picture on a semi cloudy morning A LOT of light shows through. It gives my room a pinkish glow which is cool.\nYou can not see through the curtains, so sheerness gets 5 stars. The curtains have a decent weight to them so they should be energy efficient. Overall, I\u2019m content with them.",
                "Great curtains! I bought these curtains for the color and for the privacy. And they work great! You can\u2019t see through it, and it keeps out light very well. They also stop drafts and winds from coming through and are made of a nice, durable material. I highly recommend the purple ones! I got the super long length too - the \u201c84 inch ones.",
                "I ordered the white but they seem light grey. I was surprised at the weight of the panels as my expectations were kind of low. I think these will serve the purpose of keeping the room warmer this winter.",
                "They are fine for blocking the light. However, I attempted to steam the wrinkles and they didn\u2019t come out. I washed them according to the instructions, line dried, and ironed on liw heat but they are still wrinkled.",
                "I purchased the \"cafe\" color, expecting that it would be a light brown. However, I found the color to be more in the gold family of colors, especially when up against a true, light, neutral, brown wall. Also, the yellow tones of the curtains are a bit cool, thereby clashing with the warmer undertones of the brown. The fabric itself is very nice, looks much more expensive than it actually is. The back side of each curtain is white, which is also nice. And, I was impressed by how lightweight each panel is. I exchanged the cafe for the ivory and found that the ivory was just pretty white actually, which is fine. My difficulty is that this fabric looks and feels like a form of plastic. They are still lightweight and with a white backing, but I fear that they will look cheap once hanging on the windows. I'm sorry to say I am returning the ivory as well.",
                "I really like the way the curtains look. Not so sure yet if they are energy efficient or how well they block out the light since the curtains are in a spare bedroom. They probably aren't the best. BUT for the money, you can't beat it. I am pleased with the purchase.",
                "I was looking for lime green curtains with rod pockets and was happy to find these at a great price for my daughter. They are a great green color and they are also a good blackout curtain. They are a decent quality, definitely good for the price.",
                "I like these. I purchased these to replace the ones I left at my old house. I love the color and you cannot see through them. Good value and they give privacy in the rooms. They are also energy efficient. No draft.",
                "I love these curtains! Not exactly what I was expecting when I bought them but I fell in love with them the picture doesn\u2019t even do them justice. I haven\u2019t noticed yet any changes in if it keeps our heat in but checking that soon \ud83d\ude1d",
                "I\u2019m going to put them up when I change my summer curtains to the winter ones. I\u2019m in the process of installation my windows first. I live in apartment building where the heat is limited.",
                "I will be purchasing again for my bedroom. They work great for blocking out light.",
                "These are good quality, and they block light well enough. I got them to darken my toddler\u2019s room in the summer, and it works for that. The only thing I dislike is how hard it is to open them. They are lined with a rubbery plastic coating, which is also inside of the rod pockets, so they are really difficult to pull open. I\u2019m not able to lift them up as I try to slide them open because there is a small toy shelf in front of the window, but maybe it would be easier to open if I could lift and slide at the same time.",
                "Of course the material is a little stiff/rough but that\u2019s ok bc it isn\u2019t expensive! The purple doesn\u2019t let in sunlight, the teal does a little! The grey is a different brand\u2026 overall good buy!",
                "They're nice white curtains that let light in during the day but definitely not true blackout, or even close to \"potential\" blackout curtains. They do look great in person though. However, it was a pain to have to place 2-3 orders for the amount of sheers needed as the company has a limit of 3 per purchase.",

                "I am a guy. I start with that so that you will all learn from my experience with this product. My wife was on a mission to find a product that would help with her facial acne and redness. I was at Whole Foods one day and asked an expert to recommend a product for my wife. She quickly recommended this saying that Resveratrol was great for acne. I bought it on the spot.\n\nI should also tell you that I myself am a product junkie. Every since I was in my 20's I have been cursed with horrible razor rash / burn on my neck after I shave. Because I am 1/8th Hungarian, I have a very very quick growing beard. I am always on the lookout for a product that will cure this. And trust me when I say I have tried every-single-product out there. Everything from the high end, to the low end, the all natural, the organic, every single mens only line of products... I have tried them all.\n\nThen I come home with this. I tell my wife to put it on her face before we go to bed. Just to be funny I also applied it to my neck, jokingly saying, \"Hey what if this product actually works?\"\n\nWe did this together for a week, each night applying the cream, her to her face and me to my neck.\n\nThen I shaved. I had let my beard grow a little bit, normally I shave twice a week. I shaved like I normally do, got out of the shower (I always shave in the shower, if you are not doing this then you are doing it wrong my friend) and looked at my neck.\n\nMy neck was razor rash/burn free! Ok, not 100% but like at least 80% better then the last 15 years of shaving! I was astonished! I had actually found a product that worked!\n\nMy wife you ask? How was her redness and acne. Well, she got results too. Far less redness and breakouts.\n\nBut the real winner here is me! I not longer have razor burn. I bought more of this here on Amazon. I use it every night on my neck. My neck looks so much more attractive... I know that sounds funny, but I have had a constant razor rash on my neck for 15 years! NOW IT'S GONE!\n\nGet this for any guy suffering from the same affliction as me. Trust me!",

                "When I was in college I was involved in marketing research. Part of my job for over a year was investigating women's uses and preferences of feminine hygiene products, in other words pads and tampons. That's when I decided, if I ever needed to use pads on a fairly regular basis, Kotex would be my brand. After having four children, I need pads more regularly than I have in the past. I like these pads. Unfortunately, I do have to agree with other reviews about the cover. The paper strip and cover shouldn't be attached. The paper cover on all pads was designed so that you can use the cover for disposing of the used pad once you're through with it. Not everyone uses it for that, I don't, but there are those who do, or would like to, and they can't because that paper strip is attached to the cover. Come on Kotex! Get back to the original design, so the cover can be used however your customers choose to use it!\n\nThe cover aside, I like these pads because they are soft, comfortable, and not too bulky. They stick well and don't leave adhesive residue behind on your underwear. I'll continue to use this brand because I genuinely like the pads. They're also great for throwing in your purse for everyday use as well as for travel. Each pad is individually wrapped for hygiene and discretion.\n\nIn addition to myself, unfortunately, my beloved husband had a radical prostatectomy and suffers from urine leakage. He's tried men's products and actually prefers these pads 100% over any men's products! He finds them soft, comfortable, slim, and highly effective for protection from leaks. I feel horrible that he has to use pads but I'm incredibly thankful that Kotex makes a product that helps him stay dry and fresh!\n\nSo, for myself and my husband, we're sticking together with Kotex U!\n\nHighly recommended!",

                "Perfect length. But my favorite thing about these is that there are no wings!!!!",
                "The pads themselves are fine, but the outside wrapper has certainly changed! It was very hard to get apart and to get the pad peeled away from it. Always before it was easy to get open and it had a piece of tape to secure the soiled pad in the wrapper when you changed. It makes me wonder if these were authentic Kotex pads or knock offs! Not very happy with them, will probably never buy again.",
                "These are wider than a lot of others which I like. They are long and thin and stay secured.",

This was definitely the cheaper option, but I realize it was more comparable to the DSC 4X blades (I have used both executive and the 4x from DSC). The BIC Flex 4 was still cheaper by $2 compared to the DSC 4X blades. Overall, I find the blades to be more suitable for trimming my sideburns and mustache. The aloe stripe is not as smoothing compared to my DSC executive blades and doesn't feel like it cuts deep and clean like the DSC executive blades. I would say this is more like a 4X alternative. It used to be cheaper going on a DSC plan, but the BIC Flex 4 is just as good with a cheaper price. The DSC 4X is $7 while the BIC Flex 4 is $5. You get a new razor handle each time you purchase the product unlike other places which gives you replaceable blades. I really do wish BIC allowed use to just go buy cartridges as this would be more environmentally friendly and less wasteful just trashing a perfectly fine razor handle. Pro: Affordable, Comparable to the DSC 4X, Trustable global brand, Good for a good trim Cons: Cartridges are not sold separately from the handle, aloe strip was not as smoothing, good for 3-4 light uses or 1-2 heavy use.",

                "Excellent screen, deepest black, high contrast. I highly recommend this tablet for movie, video, and game.The AMOLED screen also makes the tablet thin and light.\n\nI have used an ipad2 for a year. Compared with the 9.7 inch, I think the 7.7 inch form factor is very useful. It is more portable and convenient, but you don't lose the advantage of wide screen.\n\nBut its user interface is not that great. The Ipad2 seems more completed product. I expect ICS update will solve many issues associated with laggy transition, touch response, and etc. The ICS update was officially confirmed by verizon. But I don't know when it comes.\n\nI heavily use this tablet, but even though I consider it, the battery doesn't go long (normally 6-8 hours in straight usage). The AMOLED screen seems to eat the battery very quickly.\n\nCompared with motorola razr maxx, its LTE signal strength is little bit weak, but acceptable in general. You can use free mobile hotspot. If you have another LTE microSIM in your verizon smartphone, you can use it here. But it is not that convenient actually, because you have to pull out and insert the tiny one. Of course, no call function here. You can just use Skype stuff to make a call.\n\nThis is also good when you read pdf documents such as science and engineering journal papers. This screen size is just minimum to read the papers. I think 5 inch galaxy note or other smartphones are too tiny.\n\nOverall, it is higly portable, useful, and visual. If you already have ipad2, I think you don't need new ipads. I agree the price of this tablet is expensive, but it is worthy to pay.

                "Excellent screen, deepest black, high contrast. I highly recommend this tablet for movie, video, and game.The AMOLED screen also makes the tablet thin and light.\n\nI have used an ipad2 for a year. Compared with the 9.7 inch, I think the 7.7 inch form factor is very useful. It is more portable and convenient, but you don't lose the advantage of wide screen.\n\nBut its user interface is not that great. The Ipad2 seems more completed product. I expect ICS update will solve many issues associated with laggy transition, touch response, and etc. The ICS update was officially confirmed by verizon. But I don't know when it comes.\n\nI heavily use this tablet, but even though I consider it, the battery doesn't go long (normally 6-8 hours in straight usage). The AMOLED screen seems to eat the battery very quickly.\n\nCompared with motorola razr maxx, its LTE signal strength is little bit weak, but acceptable in general. You can use free mobile hotspot. If you have another LTE microSIM in your verizon smartphone, you can use it here. But it is not that convenient actually, because you have to pull out and insert the tiny one. Of course, no call function here. You can just use Skype stuff to make a call.\n\nThis is also good when you read pdf documents such as science and engineering journal papers. This screen size is just minimum to read the papers. I think 5 inch galaxy note or other smartphones are too tiny.\n\nOverall, it is higly portable, useful, and visual. If you already have ipad2, I think you don't need new ipads. I agree the price of this tablet is expensive, but it is worthy to pay. Most of all, the high price is due to the 7.7 inch AMOLED screen which is currently the largest area among AMOLED products in the world.

I have NEVER spent more than $10 on a bottle of shampoo, but as I\u2019ve gotten older I want to make sure I keep my hair healthy.

                "We are transitioning our 11 year old son's room from \"kiddie\" to a more grown-up style and need bookshelf space for his growing library of books. Chose this and it works just fine, though the fit & finish aren't perfect and it's a bit pricey.\nAssembly of the bookshelf was easy enough. All you'll need is a hammer and philips screwdriver and about 30-45 minutes to build it, and the instructions are clear. The unit is not, of course, made of real wood but MDF (fiberboard). It's pleasingly sturdy, and the applied finish is attractive for the most part. It doesn't have as much red in the coloration as I expect in a cherry finish, but its attractive nonetheless. The block legs are a nice touch and add character.\nUnfortunately, the fit & finish aren't perfect. There were one or two small light scuff marks here and there, along with a few places where the wood grain finish was starting to peel a little. There are also a few small gaps where pieces should fit tight. None of these were significant enough to be a big deal, but could be better.\nPrice-wise, this feels a little overpriced. I ordered this very similarly sized  South Shore Axess Collection 5-Shelf Bookcase, Royal Cherry  for my office about a year ago, and it costs about half as much for very similar quality. Given the few finish issues and higher price here, it's hard to recommend this one unless you just love the design (and those block feet do help it in the looks department). Overall this is a serviceable piece that works fine but doesn't really stand out.",
                "I was looking forward to adding yet another shelving unit in an upstairs bedroom. I have one, but it\u2019s not quite enough to house the collection of historical books I\u2019ve been purchasing. I was looking forward to a sturdy, but lightweight shelf. The Bush collection appeared to be just what I was looking for, but I was sorely disappointed on many levels. When it arrived, I found the weight to be way to much for the area needed. The dimensions were good, but with the addition of books would be a stressor on the floor.\n\nA change of plan was quickly in order and I decided that I\u2019d use the Bush shelf to house tools and other woodworking / home repair necessities in our workshop. The weight would be acceptable and, I thought, I\u2019d add the doors at a later time (they can be purchased). When I started to unpack, I was dismayed to find that the boards looked cheap. The core is pressboard, with no attempt to even cover it with any laminate.\n\nAside from immediately realizing the quality was somewhat sub-par, I had broken boards. The packaging was simply board upon board, not enough to protect the shelving. There was some Styrofoam, but not between the boards. The entire unit, considering what I received, is grossly overpriced. The \u201clook\u201d isn\u2019t good and I\u2019m left with some broken shelves.\n\nI\u2019ve purchased this type of material before, specifically a television stand. In time any bit of moisture will make the finish pop up. I will use it in my workshop where it will be appreciated, but I\u2019d certainly not recommend it if one wants something nice for the home. Nice it isn\u2019t and it certainly isn\u2019t the high-quality shelving unit I was looking forward to.",
                "It's a beautiful sturdy bookcase. The delivery company called and confirmed the date and window when they would deliver it so there was no need to worry about it sitting on my front porch when no one was home. Side panels are all one piece, therefore it will be helpful to have someone home with you to help carry the long box into the spot in your home as it is heavy. I put it together by myself and had no trouble wiggling it into its place once it was assembled. The only part I found difficult was hammering the plastic bit into the bottom shelf where the feet screw into it. I had to keep pounding away until it went flush with the particleboard. Luckily, the board was not damaged. This however is something I wish the manufacturing plant would have done before shipping. The instructions include weight capacity per shelf, and each one is 65 pounds. See the picture for details.",
                "Good for the price. My only problem with this product is the tape that won't come off of the front part of one shelf. It looks tacky, and it is very time consuming to peel it off. I just gave up and left it. Now it's partially peeled off.",
                "When comparing product side by side, this product stated it was made out of WOOD!!! Well all the other products in the same side by side panels stated they were made out of pressboard,manufactured wood, or laminate! PLEASE SONT BE FOOLED THIS IS MANUFACTURED WOOD NOTHING WITH REALL WOOD HERE!!!!",
                "Poorly made. WalMart sells better models than this for a cheaper price.",
                "My biggest gripe with this bookcase is that the cost does not match the quality. I have bought inexpensive bookcases and MDF/compressed furniture in the past from big box chains and a certain Swedish mega store and this bookcase rivals those supposedly 'inferior' and cheaper products. I personally have no issue with the cheaper compressed wood bookcases because their price reflects that it would not be a true wood product. At nearly 200 hundred dollars before tax, I am offended that they would sell this low quality product and pretend it is higher end.\n\nThe sweet cherry color is not really a cherry that most people identify with. The bookcase resembles more of a darker mahogany with chestnut accents. If you want a red tone or true cherry then do not purchase this color. The legs are attractive and each shelf will hold a maximum of 65lbs per the manufacturer's instructions. Putting the furniture together took just about under an hour and was relatively simple as these types of bookcases usually are. My biggest issue was that the coloring or 'sweet cherry' is just a sticker covering compressed wood. The moment a touch of water touches the finish, it will bubble and destroy the whole area. My personal bookcase had many imperfections/nicks and there are all these unsightly gaps at all the areas where the furniture meets. Another annoyance is that the backerboard that makes this bookcase steady is extremely thin. I wasn't expecting that the whole case would be so wobbly without the back because I believed there would be more solid wood in the construction overall.\n\nI am not honestly recommending this bookcase because the product should not be this expensive for MDF compressed wood. The long term quality and sturdiness is questionable. Do not drag this item across the room when it is loaded because the structural integrity will be completely lost. Honestly, go to (T) arget or (I) kea and find a comparable piece for so much less. Also the item will be drop-shipped! Our bookcase was delivered to the front door after a ring of the bell. I never did see the delivery person or company.",
                "For the price, I did not think this bookcase was worth it. We have been buying somewhat cheap furniture so far in our lives and are trying to transition to furniture that is better made. However, when we had the opportunity to receive this item for review we decided to take it. At this price point, I was expecting something slightly on the lower end and was willing to live with that. What I got is something that is no better or maybe lower quality than I would expect to find at a local big box store for double the price. My main problem lies with the veneer. It has a really cheap plastic feel to it. In addition in a couple of the pieces, it overlaps itself significantly and the seem is easily visible.\n\nLike many of the cheaper bookcases, this thing has very little structural integrity until you nail the backing on. The problem with this is the backing on the bookcase is not very thick and will end up tearing easily. Speaking from experience, one this happens, nearly all structural will be lost and the bookcase will crumble easily.\n\nI would not recommend this bookcase for this price. If you are looking for a lower end bookcase save some money and go to your local big box store and buy one there.",
                "This is a difficult subjetc in its way because, whether you are looking for this or similar items depends on a number of outside factors;\n\nWhat does he mean by THAT?\n\nFunny you should ask.\n\nOkay, at two distinct times in my life I have had book collections that numbered between 3.000 and 5,000 books\n\nAnd I do NOT live in a very large house\n\nSo the first priority was always to simply get enough shelving to get the books off the floor... and the desk... and the tables... and... well... the bed!\n\nSo I looked for the cheapest shelving unit I could find, which was, usually, metal industrial shelving.\n\nAs I grew older, and, marrieder, I had to make at least a GESTURE towards treating shelving as \"furniture\"\n\nIn a case like that you can find perfectly serviceable wood veneer over particle board things at Walgreen's or Walmart or Donald Trump's wall\n\nThey're easy to assemble and will suffice for some time and, if you dazzle the neighbor's with the sheer NUMBER of your books won't look nearly as cheap as you know they are\n\nBut then, at some point so subtle you might not even notice it happening (and when the number of books has dwindled through sale or donation or dogbite, you might find yourself moving on from \"furniture\" to furniture.\n\nWhen that occurs you can do far worse than this beauty; it not only LOOKS firm, it is; it not only can go into any room, it FITS in (almost) any room\n\nIt's easy to assemble and feels like it can last for decades\n\nAnd YES, you can spend a LOT more money on similar units, but, and this is the point, why?",
                "The first thing I noticed was the package was heavy! I took that as a good sign meaning the materials were of good quality. Upon opening the box, most of the Styrofoam had busted during the shipping process which left little Styrofoam pieces all over the boards of the shelf making quite a mess. I knew I would have to be showering and vacuuming after building it. After wiping most of the Styrofoam and dust (my hand was pretty dark) from the pieces, I was ready to start building. Overall, building is very simple and straightforward from the provided manual. I built it myself and found it to be actually really easy compared to other bookshelves I've built myself. Each piece is labeled with removable stickers (convenient!). I used a power screwdriver to speed up the process and was able to build the entire bookshelf in about an hour. Nailing the back \"cardboard\" was convenient as there were \"holes\" pre-cut where to nail. Although I had it upside down because of where the sticker was set, but it wasn't too big a deal as most backers don't have holes at all. You'll also need a regular Philips screwdriver and a hammer for the legs of the bookshelf which was the only somewhat \"difficult\" part when you have to hammer in the plastic pieces into a hole for the screw to fit in. Other than that I thought this build was VERY simple for a single person to put together. It's pretty easy to move around as well once built.\n\nThe color of the bookcase fits perfectly with my other furniture colors. The pegs for the moveable shelves are also very nice quality, much better than standard. I enjoy this bookcase very much and am impressed with its quality. It's a high quality \"basic\" bookshelf.",

I've never leaked with these (like I have with the Always Infinity line, which I am not a fan of) and I'm never afraid of leaking when I have them on. They're not bulky so they're comfortable and easy to move in. Every other pad I've tried is too thin (usually leaks) too bulky (shows through tight pants) too uncomfortable (not soft) or too skinny (dangerous territory on the borders.) These pads are in every sense of the phrase, just right! Plus, they absorb like crazy. I will probably never use another pad because there will probably never be a better one.",
                "What can I say about pads? They\u2019re pads. Lol they get the job done. Large pack lasts really long in a house with multiple girls. And I like the wings to keep in place. Great quality and quantity.",
                "I bought this item by mistake and ready to return but the seller gave me full refund and let me keep it. thanks !",
                "You'll need to buy a roll of tape to keep these bandages secure. They put the adhesive on the wrong side.",
                "I wanted to purchase Always Maxi Size 2 at a local store, but they do not have any. I made a purchase on Amazon expecting it is the same. However, the quality of these pads does not seem like it is made by Always. The packaging of the pads are different, usually the package are the same. There's a mixture of swirls, dots, or the original. The durability of the pads are bad too. The one purchased from the store does not tear apart after 2 hours of usage, but these do. Some of the wings does not even have sticky on them. Thus, these are either defects or are not from Always. Highly disappointed.",
                "I bought these for postpartum wear and they were the worst pads I\u2019ve ever worn. They were uncomfortable, didn\u2019t feel dry, did not absorb well. Go with something else.",
                "They work. Ugh. But too thick. Spend the extra change for the thinner ones for daytime. But just fine for night. After having kids I can only use pads. And I\u2019ve not found an organic option that works like the more plastic chemical options, it is what it is. The material on the top of the pad can be a little irritating or sticky feeling as it\u2019s more plastic netting type than some others in the same brand but not too bad. Cheap backups for sure!",
                "Great price! Came very quickly. Needed these right away and received them very fast. Satisfied with the product and how much it carries! Will buy again",
                "Although one of the three packages that I ordered was ripped open, everything else was fine. Great product.",
                "Pretty good\nExcept for they don\u2019t stick nicely to the underwear",
                "A little thicker than I expected, but when I went back a read the description, I suppose they are as described."

                "That helps my son with his colic and upset stomach. That's amazing like miracle. It's so fast to see it happens",
                "I wanted a product that didn't contain sodium bicarbonate for my daughter. I had read all the reviews on this product,so we ordered it. And IT WORKS. My daughter is now 1 and we are still using this. She is gassy in the night,wakes up screaming,legs kicking etc. Just becareful because it is black! My daughter has had NO side effects from this either. But everyone is different.",
                "Firstly, I really don't know if this helps the little one or not since we use a mixture of Tummy Calm, simethicone, and probiotics. Any of them can be helping or just a placebo, however, since the little one seems to be doing well, we don't want to stop and disrupt anything. As soon as I build the courage, I'll try taking the little one off this product.\n\nThe bottle definitely needs to be shaken before administering. I accidentally forgot to shake one time, and I pulled clear liquid into the dropper. The color should be black. The liquid can potentially stain, especially on clothes or bibs if not washed immediately, however, I always have a wipe with me and immediately wipe the little one's mouth. I do not have any issue with staining on little one's face. I also make sure to dispense just a little at a time.\n\nMy biggest complaint about this product is how they've designed their bottle and dropper. The dropper size is much shorter than the bottle. The circumference of the dropper is just slightly smaller than the opening of the bottle. When you get down towards the bottom 1/5 of the bottle, it's impossible to draw any liquid up. Because the length of the dropper is not long enough, and the circumference of the dropper/bottle opening doesn't allow you to tilt the bottle/dropper to draw the liquid out. You're left with pouring liquid out of the bottle and then drawing into the dropper. Luckily, I purchased a thinner dropper that I am able to use, but this shouldn't be necessary. This is completely baffling to me why it would be designed like this. The only conclusion is so you can waste product and purchase more. All other baby liquid products that I have used that utilize a dropper have a design where you can extract all of the product out of the bottle without having to pour the contents out. Either make the neck of the bottle wider, or provide a thinner dropper.\n\nPROS\n\u2022 Maybe it works for your little one (if it does, great!)\n\u2022 Little one doesn't seem to dislike the taste\n\nCONS\n\u2022 Need to quickly clean up any spills\n\u2022 Bottle design\n\u2022 Dropper design\n\nEdit 9/2/2019: Manufacturer stated (read comments below) that the bottle was overfilled to compensate for not being able to reach all the liquid in the bottle. My tests of actual usage yielded only 40 dosages at 1.25mL, and not the advertised 47 dosages.\n\nEdit 9/13/19: Have had the little one off this product since the last dosage on 9/2/19. Have not noticed any adverse effects of removing this product and will not be using it any longer. If nothing else, it's curious why the company has not come back to comment on why the product is NOT overfilled as they suggested it was. Come to your own conclusions.\n\n\u25bcIf this review was helpful, click the button and let me know! Thanks!",
                "We have been buying this since our son (now 10) was a baby. It works every time he has any tummy issues.",
                "I've never written a review on amazon before. These drops have saved us so many times. Our baby has always had issues with gas.. as a breastfeeding momma I had to watch everything I ate as everything gave her an upset belly. She would wake in the middle of the night with bad gas. The normal gas drops did nothing and we were going through them like crazy. These black gas drops give our baby instant relief. She passes the gas quickly and calms down and goes back to sleep. We are on our 3rd bottle. The price seems spendy but they do last along time and really I'd pay almost anything to give our babe this instant relief. If your baby is struggling with gas or stomach pain, buy these!! I also saw them being sold in walgreens for over $20. So the best price is here. They also seem to help with teething. Only giving 4 stars because of the droper, but you get the hang out it. They are messy but usually our baby is screaming in pain so its easy to give to her. Just a little at a time.",
                "So far today is day two using on my two month old. He would be very cranky after ever bottle feeding. We have changed formulas many times. I am putting a little bit in his bottles through out the day instead of one full dose at once and he is a totally different baby!!!! So happy now and passing gas with ease. Down fall is the black color and I did stain my clothes at first.",
                "I think I got the same background story as many of you: my newborn got colics, as it is my first baby I got into panic mode, spend the nights reading though the internet and got:\n- Chamomile globulis\n- Carbo vegetabilis globulis\n- Lactase\n- Gerbers smooth drops probiotics (was BioGaia)\n- Symethicon\nand ordered the two best reviewed amazon solutions:\n- Gripe water\n- Tummy calm.\nI spend days and weeks doing try and error to test every single solution and see if there was any progress. What I found out is:\nevery baby is different!!! If something isn't working for me, it doesn't mean it won't work for you, so TRY IT!\nIn my case, the tummy clam was the solution! It's the only thing we are using today (with a lot of cuddling and monkey grip (helps a lot!).\nFirst of all: it is homeopathic! No chemicals, no Symethicon, just natural stuff!\nit works! How can I be so sure? very simple: I stopped giving it 2 times for one day and the colic was immediately back!\nPro:\n- compared to the gripe water, the serving size is much smaller. We started with 0.3 before or during every meal, and then switched to 0.6 (at 6 weeks approximately). Baby is doing great, there is no need to push hard anymore to poop, so he doesn't wake up anymore.\nContra:\n- I love this product, really, but there is ONE THING I really hate: THE COLOR!\nYes it matters. It is black. That means, it stains! And the stains are not easy to wash out! So I am very careful every time I give it to him, and try doing it BEFORE every meal, so he doesn't spit it when he burps. It helps a lot, but you will still get some stains...\n\nAs I mentioned: every baby is different, so something that worked for me, might not work for you, but I would definitely try it!",
                "My 7 week old son has some gas problems - he's often gassy and during the night time (especially the later it gets, from about 4am onward), it seems to get worse. He strains and pushes and turns red. At times he seems very uncomfortable and a few times he has even woken himself up crying (I'm imagining due to the discomfort). I took him to the doctor and am told he is fine, and this is a common issue with newborns. I'm glad he's OK but it's still rough to see him so uncomfortable (and to be honest, it really interrupts MY sleep to her him grunting and straining so much). I tried the Mylicon but that really didn't seem to do anything for him. I also tried Dr. Christopher's fennel and catnip drops but my son HATED the taste - it actually made him cry and didn't seem to work. The Tummy Calm definitely works - however, not as miraculously for me as it has with some people who's reviews I read. There are nights where it works very well and seems to get rid of his gas pretty quickly, but other nights it doesn't seem to help at all. I think the combination of using this product as well as making sure to feed him at an angle, burp him, and keep him upright after eating works best to minimize the gas problems. Overall a good product and I like that it is all natural.",
                "I originally bought this in 2016 for my colicky infant. It was incredible. It would instantly break up the gas bubbles in her tummy (you could hear it hit the gas bubbles and break them up) and I would get tons of burps out immediately and within 30 minutes, she'd fart up a storm. I recommended it to everyone. HOWEVER I recently bought this for my new infant since his lazy latch creates excess gas, and I regret it. They switched out the dropper for a syringe (which makes administering it a lot harder- the plunger got stuck when I was giving it to him so I added a little more pressure and it shot him in the back of the throat) and changed the formula. After I gave him the full dose, there was no gas breakup. None. Not only that, but for the next 24 hours, it was a nightmare. He was in so much pain- he wouldn't stop crying. He wouldn't pass gas or have a dirty diaper. It took 48 hours for him to finally poop. I know its normal for babies to skip a few days- but not my son. He goes a few times a day, every day, and after that 48 hours his dirty diapers picked up where they left off. It took 3 days for him to pass it all through his system. How do I know? You'll see the remnants of it in the diaper. I do not recommend this at all. The original Tummy Calm i bought in 2016 was pure magic. But this stuff is garbage. Dont waste your money.",
                "This has saved my sanity honestly and has been invaluable with both my children. One has eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) and before he was diagnosed, especially when he was an infant we had no idea what was going on, and this was the only thing that gave him any sort of comfort. Simethicone did absolutely nothing. Just bare in mind that this does have charcoal in it so poop and vomit/spit up will be black. It's normal. Also be careful not to stain clothes (I can usually get it out in the wash regardless). Buy this product, you will not be disappointed. One of my babies required an elemental formula (like alimentum, nutramigen, puramino, Neocate, etc) which is constipating, I mixed in some of this with every bottle and we were good to go. I couldn't have asked for anything better. This product is truly wonderful (and the price used to be much higher if I'm not mistaken, so even less of a reason not to try it!).",
                "I\u2019ve used this for all my babies and over 7 years now. All my babies are super gassy for whatever reason. When I discovered this with my first child it was such a game changer. So grateful I found it because it truly makes a difference. I\u2019ve used Tummy Calm for my infants for their tummy troubles and even in their toddler years. In my experience, giving it to them before bed was the most helpful to not have them wake up from gas pain. Highly recommend.",
                "Tried it for the first time the day it arrived and also happened to be an evening my baby girl (7 weeks) went into a full melt down - she is usually very chill and relaxed unless she has bad gas problems... We tried everything - carrying stomach down, bicycling legs, rubbing belly, burping everything...\n\nFinally, though I really hate giving her anything if I can help it, we broke down and opened the Tummy Calm... Gave her 1/3 of the recommended dose. She took it easily and even seemed to like the taste!\n\nQuickly we could feel her tummy bubble and pop inside! She farted a couple of times, burped on her own (while lying in her cradle!) and fell asleep for 4 hours...\n\nI have since used it 3 other times and I have found that in general she burps and toots more easily when she has had it. If I haven't used it in a few days, her burps are harder to come by... if she has had it recently (within a day or 2), her burps are easy to get and big! And she seems much more relaxed...\n\nI am happy it is all-natural and not a chemical (which I was avoiding, even though husband brought those drops home first... I didn't use them).\n\nThe liquid is black - it wipes off her mouth easily, but will stain fabric (temporarily)",
                "I recently purchased this for my 4th baby and recommend to any new moms who are battle gas in their little baby's tummy! All 4 of my babies have used this with no trouble (oldest is now 6 years). With my first baby I tried lots of different gas relief drops and grip water, but they only worked a fraction of the time. Colic Calm worked quickly every time. I use half the recommended amount after burping baby, usually at night, and baby calms right down and drifts back to sleep. The only downfall is the liquid is black and difficult to wash out of clothes sometimes, but with practice I'm able to feed it to baby with little spill and the relief for baby is worth the extra laundry effort. I highly recommend!",
                "My cousin recommended this for my 8 month old who was teething since it worked to help sooth her son while he was teething! My daughter has tummy trouble occasionally too so this helped tons with that and it seemed to ease the teething pain. It also stopped her hiccups within 3 minutes of administrating it! (I forget where, but I read that it can help with that too and it did!)\nAt first, my daughter didn't like the flavor so we mixed it in water (which she also didn't like) then tried it in baby food (which she didn't mind), but after 3 or 4 doses she doesn't need it mixed with anything anymore.",
                "This stuff nearly killed my baby. I used it for months. Not sure if it worked or not but my baby was so gassy & fussy so I kept using it. \u201cCarbo vegetabilis\u201d IS CHARCOAL. Charcoal is a binder so it will absorb bad stuff (good for poisoning) but it also absorbs the good nutrients and prevents absorption of nutrients!!! (Can cause major damage when overused) My baby starting loosing weight, went pale, had extreme stomach pain, barely slept, made his gas worse, and so much more. Now I\u2019m trying to heal his gut. It has been awful. This stuff would\u2019ve killed him if I continued using it.",
                "Received this product very quickly and item was packaged nicely. I ordered this project for my son who was having some yummy issues while trying to figure out the cause of severe gas and upset stomach likely related to a food allergy. This is the only thing that brought him quick relief and comfort. The flavor/taste of medication didn\u2019t bother my son. He said \u201cit tastes good\u201d (my children don\u2019t usually mind taking any types of otc medications/supplements). The bottle is a good size and amount of medication is of good valued or money when compared to medications in store. Recommend this product to have as needed for children.",
                "Tummy calm was used on my newborn infant, like less than 5 weeks newborn. GREAT for newborns by the way. He did not take to formula at all and went to full time breastfeeding but the damage from dairy was already done. I bought this twice and would use it when he was super gassy or crying from discomfort. It would calm him and put him to sleep. The first few times I used it the gas came right out. After that it was more for my comfort than his. I didn't really notice much difference in bloating and gas but he would be more comfortable. Not a cure but it can help you out. Tummy calm teamed with probiotics worked the best for me. After I added the probiotic drops WITH the tummy calm the gassiness went away completely! If I had this issue again, I will be teaming this with a probiotic for sure.",
                "I found Tummy Calm through intensive research. My daughter was born with Spina Bifida and she suffers from many intestinal problems. Most foods cause her bloating and her tummy was always bigger than what she could carry around. So at an early stage I found colic calm for babies and then I turned to tummy calm as she started her toddler stage. It works wonders within minutes of giving it to her. This has been the most natural product that I found for her and she dousing seem to mind the color nor the taste. I am grateful I found tummy calm, it's been a savior for her!",
                "Oh my goodness! Amen to this product! It\u2019s so hard dealing with a gassy baby and not knowing how to help. Pumping my baby with simethicone drops all the time and only getting delayed temporary relief. I was getting so tired of it and searched so hard for something homeopathic and that\u2019s when I discovered tummy calm. I was nervous to try it and spend the extra $ but I am so glad I did! Just ordered my second bottle because I\u2019m low on the first and just need to have handy. It instantly takes away my sons hiccups and I don\u2019t give a full dose for that, just like .5ml and it always instantly works.\nI noticed he needs it less and less for gas pains too. This stuff is seriously magic and I recommend it highly! Especially in the name of your babies discomfort. I hope everyone loves it as much as I do.",
                "I have tried everything for my sons tummy, gas drops, gripe water, Everything you name it and nothing worked. I use colic calm probiotic drops for him but I thought i would try this when he has gas problems or a upset tummy. I gave it to him and in 5 minutes he was a whole new baby. I finally found something that works for my son!! If your hesitant about this, JUST GET IT!"

                "I've been using this deodorant for years. It was very effective and had a mildly sweet, soft lavender scent. I planned to use it until I no longer use deodorant (i.e. forever). Lo and behold, I ordered my most recent duo last month, opened and used the first one this past weekend, and ICK! The smell has definitively been changed (or I got a bad batch). The labeling is all the same, but the scent is more ozonic/aquatic/masculine. It's not bad, per se, it's just not what I've been using for a long time. I went to Walgreen's today to check their stock. I'm sort of ashamed to admit I pulled back the sticker covering the gel holes on two deodorants - same different, masculine scent. I noticed they had several scents with labeling stating they were using a new formula, but NOT this type. Nonetheless, it's different. I'm gutted. Why, Secret, why?",

I had already purchased all my hardware (different brand) in satin nickel. Really wished I had discovered this line of Delta first. But now I realize I could use a couple of shelves. Searched for awhile, and then I came across these ! Just what I wanted ! Matched the style of my 1924 home & remodel perfectly (white subway tile, hex tiled floor). Classic look, and I think never goes out of fashion. But satin nickel was not an option, so I asked the community if the brillance stainless steel was close to a satin nickel. All the answers I received didn't really help...some said it was \"really shiney\", \"not a satin finish at all\". But it looked close to satin nickel on my computer, so I took a chance and purchased 2 of them. A perfect match to all my other satin nickel hardware !! They are well made, nice and solid, have a little weight to 'em. I just installed them. Comes with a handy dandy template ! After reading several reviews, I ignored the instructions and went with the 1/4\" drill bit. Installed on tile & drywall, no studs. Very solid, they're not going anywhere. I also went with the suggestion of using painters tape to keep the bit from dancing. But It still did the polka, all over ! So I found an odd screw, and hammered into the tile just a bit to make a small divit. Them drilled away. Worked like a charm ! I installed one over my toilet, where I put decorative jars, filled with items on the shelf & hand towels on the bar, \"double duty\". The second one I put in my tub/shower, for all my shampoos conditioners, shaving cream...etc. Really holds alot ! I hang my wash cloth on the bar. Like some other reviews have stated, \"you almost don't want to use 'em & get them all smudged up & gunky\". They're just too pretty ! These are the cherry on top of my bathroom (took twice as long) remodel. Also fantastic price & lightning delivery !",
                "Installed this in the bathroom. It looks great, was easy to install if you have the right tools like a drill and level.\nOnce installed it is very sturdy and looks great.",
                "A very nice shelf and easy to install! Here is how I installed mine. Hold it against the wall upside down, yes upside down as this is key and keep reading. The reason you want it upside down is because you are going to use those set screws as guides to mark your center lines with a pencil. This will give you the two exact center lines as to where you would like to have it hang when you turn it right side up. Now that you have your exact center lines marked. We will move on to the horizontal line you will need for your height of the shelf. You will need a 24\" or 48\" level depending upon which shelf length you bought. You may have to borrow a level? Place the level across in a horizontal position on those center marks you made and move the level until it is at the height you want. Now take a pencil and mark a small line on each center line and be sure the level is showing level. When your done it should look like two small crosses or a crosshatch or cross-hairs on the wall. Now take one of the mounting brackets and hold it so the cross point is showing through that little center hole. Now still holding the bracket trace out the two little oblong holes. Next center your drill bit on each oblong hole and drill through. Do both mounting brackets this way. When you have that done then drive the hard rubber sleeves into the holes. When that is done, using the screws provided mount the hanging brackets onto the wall and snug them up. Now your ready to hang the shelf and tighten the set screws.",
                "Had handyman do install, he had no issues. Shelf looks very nice. Like the look. Hoping in the future no pitting or staining being it is in a well ventilated bathroom.",
                "I purchased two of these units to go inside showers. They look great and hold several bottles of shampoo, etc. The glass shelf is easy to periodically clean. The items placed on the shelf are protected from falling off by the guard rail that goes across and around the shelf. The towel bar is practical and few of the other models I looked at include one. The piece came assembled except for the brackets. I used a contractor to drill through ceramic tiles in order to install, but it could easily be a DIY project. Great looking piece and certainly on the lower end of the price scale. The manufacturer put out a useful and nice looking product. I highly recommend.",
                "This is a muted champagne gold, very sophisticated color and design. Read through entire instruction sheet before beginning.",
                "I was a little worried after reading a few reviews of customers ordering this 18\" shelf and receiving the wrong sized shelf or missing some pieces. Well, I received my 18\" shelf today and I'm happy to say that it was the right size and all the pieces were in the box. Just make sure that when you open the box, take an inventory of all the pieces before discarding the box because there was a small set screw that had come off and was loose in the box. (luckily I found it in the box). This is a good looking shelf and the polished chrome is very shiny. The glass shelf is also tempered glass. I installed the towel bar and it's not as solid as I was hoping it to be (a little loose on the ends). Just wrap a little electrical tape on the ends of the towel bar before inserting them and it should be a tighter fit without any rattling. There are chrome caps that come installed where the towel bar is to be inserted. If you choose not to use the towel bar just leave them as is because they look great. If you decide to install the towel bar just remove the set screws with the supplied allen wrench, remove the chrome caps and attach the towel bar. Shelf loos great with or without the towel bar.",
                "I have a tiny bathroom, so space is at a premium. I purchased 2 of these shelves with the towel bar extension. I put one in yesterday and it looks quite pretty. I'm not very good at installing towel bars or shelves. They always seem to fall off the brackets, so we'll see how long they last, but so far so good. They do have a classy look and go well in the bronze color to the Delta Faucet we have. The glass is nice and sturdy and should be easy to keep clean without looking tatty from all the moisture in a bathroom, and I like the little bar that keeps things on the shelf. It cleared up my vanity so it's easy to clean, but keeps daily items accessible. The other shelf I'll be putting up today over the shower to keep my bath foo foos and a washcloth, helping to clear up the shower shelves. Fairly easy to put together and the hex tool was included with the screws and anchors. I think I will buy stronger anchors for the shower, as it makes me nervous having an add-on shelf.",
                "Sturdy. Good quality. Beautiful",
                "I expect more from a Delta product than this. The whole shelf looks rather flimsy when hanging on the wall. There are no meaningful instructions. The item comes with a skimpy specialized tool that didn\u2019t fit all of screws. It comes \u201cprescrewed\u201d but you have to unscrew the screws to install it on the wall. In several cases, the screws were so tight that the specialized tool wasn\u2019t up for the job. Luckily, my husband had his own tool that worked. Also, it came with mollies for the wall, but the screws given to use with the mollies were too large and this necessitated a trip to the hardware store to find the correct sized molly. After all this, we were not very happy with the result. We would have sent it back, but we were now stuck with four mollies we\u2019d never get out of the wall. So, we\u2019ll live with it.",
                "GOOD QUALITY FAST DELIVERY BEAUTIFUL FINISH",
                "Overall, looks great and is sturdy. No unpleasant surprises. Slightly pricey but worth it.",
                "A very nice-looking shelf that adds a touch of class to a bathroom wall. Below the glass shelf is a towel bar that didn't install snuggly. I took it apart and reassembled using some JB Weld in addition to the set screws. It worked great. The towel bar is now sturdy and I'm very happy with the Delta shelf and hand towel bar."

I brought him on bag of the tea & he liked it so I sent him a box. He said the next day when his stomach was upset, he drank a cup & his stomach felt better 15 minutes later. OH THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!! Oh to help a love one ease their pain gives you a special joy. I couldn\u2019t help him in any other way- but you helped so I am so grateful.\n\nI can't believe how much I love Peppermint Tea!!! I got it for IBS/ stomach inflammation during the day and it helped settled my roaring tummy. It has a smooth light herby taste that is very lighty kissed with peppermint. Bonus that it has ginger too!\n**** I ordered the second time & box came looking crumped like it had been shoved in a lot of corners.",

                "I have successfully used other actually compostable K-pods like these (Chock full o nuts for example) in my Keurig K-Supreme and have never had this problem. With San Francisco pods, most of the liquid filtering down from the Keurig was water because it bypassed the pod. The liquid in the cup was the color of very, very weak tea. Unfortunately, I just wasted $38 because these are non-fundable!\n\nUPDATE: I emailed San francisco coffee and they are sending me an adapter for my Keurig-Supreme. I'll have to let you know how that works.\n\nUpdate 2: The adapter for my Keurig K-Supreme arrived in only a few days. It is a small ring of plastic but it did the job! I am more than satisfied. I was able to finally taste the coffee. So far I have tried Breakfast Blend and French Roast. I can't decide which I like more. Thank you San Francisco Coffee. My only concern is that the adapter is likely to be accidentally thrown out due to its small size. I just sent an email to customer service to see if they will send another.",
                "I used to grind the whole coffee beans, then brew and my husband who grew up in SF loved French Roast. He was older than I and recalled the cable car on the Golden Gate Bridge and when it got near to SF he smelled the Folgers Coffee Plant. It is no longer there, but ever since that memory he drank only dark French Roast. He introduced me to it upon marriage, and it is all I drink. Now it's only me and I use the Keurig pods and it tastes as if I just ground the beans, and all I need is one cup in the morning. It works perfectly for two people or just one. I have been using it for 28 years or more and will continue to do so. This is the best.",
                "I like the regular and decaf coffee of this company very much. What I'm finding out is my multistream technology on my Keurig Slim is the needles are not penetrating the top of the coffee pods and creating puddles of water left in the top where the needles are. The bottom of this pod is too soft and isn't firm like the other Keurig pods and that's why I am not getting a complete cup as the coffee is not getting the water like it's supposed to. The last time I bought this coffee was a ground bag of decaf which I used in the pour over kind of coffee maker. The compostable pod is not for me because of this. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.",
                "I have been drinking decaf coffee for over 20 years now, and had not been able to find the compostable cups for decaf anywhere. (I wish my favorite brands of coffee would offer 100% compostable!) I have read some reviews stating that these are one-day shelf life. I have an airtight cannister (bought here on Amazon) that I use to store these. The coffee has stayed fresh for over a month - even those outside the bag. BTW, even the bag they come in is compostable! Thank you!",
                "Had to buy San Francisco Coffee French Roast from Amazon as the local Costco, where we moved to, doesn't carry San Francisco Coffee. Love the taste of the French Roast flavor. Flavorful but not too strong. I run a 6oz cup with a bit of brown sugar and powdered milk--like drinking dark chocolate! I love that the packaging is industrial compostable, so that if your city/county has a composting program, you can just toss this in the composting bin. Unfortunately, I no longer live in a city that does composting, but I don't feel as bad tossing these cups than the regular k-cups. I keep the coffee in an air-tight container to keep it fresh.",
                "I have used these pods for years! Love the taste, rich and bold. Went to order another case (120 count) and the price has risen $10.00 in less then 30 days! I get inflation etc, but this is ridiculous! Bring the price back down. No longer ordering.",
                "So I\u2019ll put this out there that this is my favorite coffee and will now be buying the grounds. In the past I had a older Keurig. And this worked perfectly with it. It made a nice bold coffee. But beware with new Keurigs that this component doesn\u2019t brew coffee efficiently. It causes a lot of water to leak around the sides making the coffee very mild if not just watery. So overall if you have a old Keurig this is 5 stars for me. But if you have a new one just buy grounds and use with a reusable k-cup.",
                "I never had a Keurig coffee maker until recently. I didn\u2019t like that I was throwing so many plastic cups into the recycle bin. I found this brand on Amazon and I have to say I\u2019m hooked. The espresso pod that comes in this mixed pack is awesome. The flavor that I found I really love though is the donut shop.",
                "This coffee is my absolute favorite. After a long search through many different brands, I can truly say that SF Bay Coffee is my top favorite. It's nicely flavored and has a light after taste. Not acidic or too strong at all. In fact it's so good, after years and years or taking coffee with sugar, I no longer need the sweetness to mask the bitterness. Oh yeah, there's NO bitterness to the breakfast blend. The Columbia supreme is awesome too, but not as well rounded as the breakfast blend. I highly recommend this k cup coffee, you won't be disappointed! Best of all, no guilt since all the packaging is compostable. Yes! Happy drinking, and wakey wakey!",
                "Wow. Very disappointed as I have ordered this brand before. The pods do not puncture. I had to push forcefully down on my Keurig just to get the pod to get a good seal. If not the water spills all over and you end up with a weak brewed watery coffee, complete with coffee grounds in the cup.",
                "I absolutely LOVE this coffee. I buy it in decaf too! It has a wonderful strong flavor and aroma! Great k cups and good prices! The only one I want to buy anymore and I love coffee, hot or cold in every flavor!",
                "I like everything about this product except for the flavor. I only drink black coffee and was expecting to enjoy these organic k-cup pods, but the flavor just isn't doing it for me. I wish there were more options for organic and sustainable coffees in pods.",
                "This coffee is very tasty and we really like that the slim plastic ring on the pods can be easily removed and recycled and the pod material is not plastic. The pods are made of plant-based commercially compostable materials.",
                "Use for making latte. Like the flavor even over going to popular coffee chains. Great value. Will definitely buy again.\nOnly difference I find with these pods over the full cup type is when the keurig blows air at the end of the cycle you don't hear it.",
                "I would probably give this 4.5 stars instead of 5 stars, only due to after punching the hole from the coffee machine to the coffee pod you do have to widen it so the ground coffee will not spill over into your cup. Love smelling the coffee before putting it in the machine and I do keep in an airtight container.",
                "I have had this coffee caffeinated and also decaffeinated both are amazing the only thing with the filter it does let a little residue through that will sit at the bottom of your cup but I prefer these over having it filtered through plastic as you don\u2019t get the plastic taste in your cup of coffee with this type of k cup. It is a pretty strong cuppa coffee so I do run it through twice to get more ounces out of one pod. I have tried other brands another types and I always come back to this one",
                "Very flavorful coffee. Donut shop is my 2nd favorite flavor from San Francisco Coffee. Fog lifter is my absolute fave! This coffee is an amazing value. I love that the pods are compostable!",
                "I'm Brazilian, so I like my coffeee srtong and flavorful, with a nice aroma. This coffee reminds me a little of coffee I used to drink in Brazil, only a bit smoother. I gave some to my mom and she loves it. She says it smells like home. The only problem is that I've become an even worse a coffee snob when I go out! LOL",
                "This flavor is not my flavor. I like a strong coffee and I like a mild coffee. The Haight flavor has a skunky flavor to it that turns my stomach. It cost a little more than the French roast which is a golden standard for coffee, everyone should try that and only try this if you want to experiment.",
                "This is the best tasting coffee. When you open the bags you can smell the fresh coffee. I also like that there is less plastic with this coffee."

I am now 30.5 years old.\nNothing helped at all and I felt like I was stuck with this skin condition forever. I am still stuck with it but haven't experienced it for awhile now since using the Sensitive + line.\n\nI have extremely dry and flaky skin. It would be oily, but also flakes. It's hard to go out to places and eat or actually eat at work. I have to be careful not to open my mouth too far, else you'll see my skin cracking and wanting to peel... I also used many things and my face would be very shiny. I have used things that try not to make it shiny, also used stuff that is similar to this as a wash but nothing worked and many things broke me out extremely quick.\n\nI would have to scrub my dead skin off my face every day or 2 to help prevent my flaky face from happening without opening my mouth wide. (I would get it if I ate like a hamburger though)\n\nEver since using this, it stopped... Completely stopped and I Had this condition since I was 19 years old. I am 30 now.\nThis changed it all, along with the Dove Men+ Sensitive lotion. I bought the whole line, even the Scalp Fortifying.\nIt was like I had dandruff on my face along with my scalp. And using the shampoo, I haven't had flaky skin up there either.\n\nI was going to try the more hydrating one, but this moisturizes enough along with that lotion.",
                "Awesome cleanser for my face. I am getting tired of those expansive makeup counter cleansers that vary from $35-$75. I usually use Shiseido Beneficence and Lar Mer foam cleanser to pamper my face + to get rid of the makeup leftovers.\n\nI am getting tired of paying such a pristine price for a facial cleanser. I talked to myself + let's check and see see how a $5-$7 cleanser works. To my surprise,it works WONDERBAR! It doesn't dry out my face or feeling harsh after using for a week. It is written for Men but what the heck? If it works - it works. We, women, are usually blinded by those fancy marketing words: soothing, deep cleaning, moisturizing, hydrating, lifting, wrinkle minimizing. Men's skin care products do not carry so many of those foo-foo words.\n\nI love this product and I've introduced this to all my chickies in my inner circle - they are so exciting about this face wash!",
                "This face wash made a beliver out of me that men need to take care of there skin I am a Black man and I suffer with pusoflixulitus I know spelled wrong, you try it. I was using a new product name bump patrol and it was realling helping me with the shaving bumps but I was still using clipper could never use a razor. Once I started using the sensitive skin face wash and then using the bump patrol it was a miracle after a couple of months I got bold and decided to try a razor. End result I don't use clipper anymore all I can say is Men start taking car of your skin you wil be amazed",
                "I've only used it once so far but I'm pleased with the results. Before, I would get out of the shower and 20 minutes later my face would be really dry but after using this once I see a major improvement, my face is smooth and feels clean.",
                "This is great for a facial wash for someone like me with sensitive skin. An aesthetician suggested this to me after a meeting at a party we were both at. Excellent when it's dry out.",
                "To the people who think this has granules...or a scrubbing effect. No!! It does not it feels like soap...for the man who gets dirty this isn't a good product for you , for the off beat \"man\" in an office who doesn't come in contact with dirt..this is for you.",
                "This is probably the best face wash I have ever used. I chose the sensitive version because my face is acne prone. There is a nice masculine fragrance added into the product that smells quite refreshing. Its very thick; I found that a pea-sized dot will cover my entire face and some of my lower neck. I will be purchasing this product again the next go-around. 5/5",
                "My skin requires me to use sensitive products. This product is sensitive on my skin, moisturizing and has a pleasant clean (not over powering) smell. I think this is a great product for guys looking for sensitive face wash.",
                "I have been using the Dove plus care for men products for about a year now, and I love them...this face wash really washes away the dirt and oils and leaves a clean feeling",
                "it is a good product , cleans well , last for a good long time. I do wish it would lather a little better , but it does the job.",
                "I've tried a lot of different face washes and this is by far the best. Other face washes (even those with moisturizers) still dried my face out after shaving. This face wash didn't affect my skin at all and it felt clean, hydrated, and revived. Great product!",
                "Only thing I use on my face.",
                "Great face wash, husband has been using for years, hard to find in stores we shop.",
                "I always try to get hypoallergenic/unscented products. I was looking for a version of this product that matched this description and the closest I could find was \"Sensitive\" and I thought it was sufficient. (It's not.)\n\nThis stuff gives me a pretty bad headache. One of the ingredients is \"Fragrance,\" which is basically a placeholder that allows a manufacturer to put just about any chemical in their product and not have to list what it is. No matter how well I rinsed my face I had fumes from the stuff wafting up into my nose and eyes for hours. No bueno.\n\nAlso it's a pretty subpar cleansing product so.",
                "Great deal, good product! Highly recommended for all males with sensitive skin!",
                "I have been using this products for a few years now. It works great.",
                "Quality face wash for sensitive skin for the price",
                "I use it each day, very good quality. Price is also good on Amazon.",
                "This says sensitive skin, but it left my face irritated. My eye lids started to slightly burn. It also left my face drier than most washes. Definitely use a skin moisturizer after this product.",

                "Alright, let preface this by saying, I am not a doctor or medical expert, I can only speak to the results, I myself have experienced.\n\nBack Story:\n\nSo about 2 years ago, I started getting dry skin around my mouth, nose, eyebrows, and occasionally my ears and cheeks. It was pretty mild, so I never went to a dermatologist. However, before this time, never did I have to lotion my skin regularly, so this was a change for me.\n\nWhen this started happening, I used Aquaphor Healing Ointment (Advanced Therapy), and while it made me look greasy or like I was sweating for a couple hours, lol, it wore off enough, and would leave me looking normal the rest of the day. The only time my skin was really irritated was right after I would shave. However, dryness/peeling would get real bad if I did not at least lotion all those areas of my face after I showered. While I did some minor Googling about the issue, I was clearly too lazy to do anything about it, and the lotion solution sufficed for me. Dumb, I know.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to about 1.5 months ago. I started to notice a white growth under my left thumbnail that started to detach my nail from my nail bed. For some reason, this concerned me more than the dry skin on my face. So after Googling again, I found ti could be a problem with yeast growth under my nail. Then, I remembered reading that yeast growth could be causing my face problems. After connecting the dots, I decided to find a possible solution, to possibly kill two birds with one stone.\n\nAfter some searching, I stumbled onto Nizoral. After reading all the reviews, I was encouraged. I purchased this product and it has helped me tremendously. I could not be happier. It says to use it only every 3-4 days, which I say you should stick to, because I would use it on back to back days and it would seem to dry my skin out, but that could have been in my head.\n\nMy Use:\n\nSo, I know this is shampoo, but I almost treat it like liquid soap. I rub it on my skin/scalp and leave it there for 3-5 minutes. For my fingernail, I would lift it, since there was a gap and the nail was coming up. I put Nizarol directly in the ever so small opening between the nail and nail bed, and left it for 3-5 minutes. I am not sure if that was smart for the fingernail, but it worked for me.\n\nResults:\n\nTLDR: It worked everywhere, lol.\n\nMouth/Upper Lip: This area was the worst of my dry skin issues. Like said, it was especially bad after shaving. Sometimes, my skin would be patchy red and inflamed after shaving, especially on the top of my chin and right below my lip. It would look gross for like an hour. In addition, when I did not shave, but did not lotion my skin, this area would eventually get pretty flaky before the end of the day. I also had issues with the corners of my mouth, especially after eating. My upper lip generally did not have any issues, but sometimes I would in very cold/dry weather.\n\nSo, after using this product, I have seen a great deal of improvement. For the first time in almost 2 years, I do not have to lotion my face every single day. The patch below my lip still is not where I want it to be, but it is very much better. My skin feels dry after a shave, but now it does not look red or inflamed. It is getting better, and I think it will continue to get better. The corners of my mouth have issues if I do not lotion for 2 days or so, but they are much more minor to what they used to be. The minor issue above my lip is currently non-existent, however, we have not had any cold weather yet. This was the most noticeable problem I had with my dry/flaky/peeling skin, and I am happy to say, Nizarol has worked wonders. I now can use regular lotion instead of Aquaphor, which I still adore.\n\nEyebrows: This was my second worse area, and I say eyebrows, but it was actually the area in between my eyebrows would flake worse than my eyebrows. I rub Nizarol into my eyebrows, in between them, and around my eye sockets. Nizarol has pretty much cleared up this issue, and I am thrilled Nizarol has basically eliminated the second worst dry area on my face. If I do not use lotion for several days, it does flake, but in a very minor way. Side note: be careful around your eyes, it burns pretty good if you get the shampoo runoff in your eye, lol.\n\nNose/Nostrils: This was my third worst area. I would have dry skin on the sides of my nose, the point of my nose, and even on the inside of my nostrils! First off, putting Nizarol in your nostrils may not be safe. If you do do it, don't huff the Nizarol when it is in your nostrils, breath through your mouth. My nose area has improved, but is now more of an issue than my eyebrows. Still it is much better, and I can go a couple days without using lotion. It is also more of the inside of the nostrils than the outside of my nose. I think if I were willing to put Nizarol further up my nose than just the inside rim, I could eliminate the problem. But, at what cost? Lol. I don't want to ingest this stuff, lol. Either way, I am still happy!\n\nHead/Scalp: I have never had much of an issue with my scalp other than minor dandruff, for which I have always used Head & Shoulders. Despite this, I use this shampoo, as intended. I can not honestly tell if it is making any difference. Also, I have very short hair, so I cannot tell if this makes my hair coarse like everyone else says. If it does, I would use a conditioner like other reviews suggest.\n\nEars/Earlobes: So, while it was more rare, but sometimes, my ear lobes and the bottom crease where the ear connected to my face would get dry and flake. I rub Nizarol on my ears, on the inside of my ears, and behind my ears/ear lobes. I have zero issues here now and never have to lotion this area any more.\n\nForehead/Cheek Areas:These were not really problem areas unless it was cold/dry/windy. We have not had that type of weather, but I really do not think it will be a problem.\n\nPelvic Area: I know this is a touchy subject, lol, but what I have to say is tame and could help some people. So several months back, something new happened, I noticed my pelvic area was dry as well, after using clippers. I used Nizarol in the creases of my leg, and in in my pelvic area, including directly on my -----. Results? Well, this has virtually eliminated the dry skin everywhere. Even better, I am chaffing less when running, which is awesome! I figured Nizarol was working everywhere else, so what the hell? Luckily for me, this was another minor issue it helped.\n\nFingernail: Getting back to my fingernail, I had this white chalky/flaky formation under my fingernail. It had got to almost halfway down my thumbnail. It was causing my nail to lift. It did not hurt, but I thought it was unsightly. So I lifted the nail and put Nizarol in there. Again, possibly not safe, but a couple weeks in and my nail is almost back to normal. I eventually started cutting deeper into my nail to get the Nizarol farther back, which has worked. My nail almost looks normal and it looks like it is pushing the last of white to the font of my nail. So the growth stopped moving backward and it has improved. Another win!\n\nOthers Uses?: As you can tell, I pretty much use this stuff all over. I put it on my elbows, the knuckles of my toes, and the point of my ankle bone. I think it is helping, but I am not 100% sure. What I can tell you is that it seems that it seems easier to get the dry skin off after applying the shampoo. A pedicure is on the docket and if I remember, I will update this review.\n\nConclusion:\n\nNizarol has worked way better than I could have hoped, and I did not even have to go to the dermatologist. I am hoping within a couple months, my skin will go back to normal. I am not sure if that will happen, but I love what Nizarol has done for me. I encourage anyone that has some of the issues I had to give it a try. Again, my issues were mild compared to some of the pictures I have seen, but I imagine if you are struggling with mild to intermediate issues, and you have not gone to a dermatologist, this could help you.\nI hope all this helps! Good luck!\n\n****Update: 7/25/2017***\n\nFingernails: Nizoral completely fixed my nail problem!\n\nFace: So, when I first started using this product, I saw quite a bit of improvement. I no longer have red patches anywhere on my face. The only issue is that there have been diminishing returns. Nizarol has helped tremendously, but I still have dryness and dead skin issues. It is much more mild now, but still exists, however, I am grateful for the continued results.\n\nScalp: Lol, I still cannot tell if this is helping or not. I still have minor dandruff. Nizarol has had no effect on my scalp as far as I can tell. Not a big deal for me though...",
                "This is my Folliculitis Journey and i include ALL THE PRODUCTS I USED to get rid of it.\nI got Folliculitis on my groin area, i had no idea what it was since i have never had it but it started spreading down my legs and leaving these dark marks/scars. The lesions started multiplying, i went to the doctors who gave me an ointment gel, which did absolutely nothing for me, it was an acne treatment.\nSince it started getting hotter and summer was near i knew i had to act fast or else i would have to wear pants all summer. First things first, from my research it states not to shave to prevent he spread of Folliculitis, so yes i did just that. I didn't shave for over a month...i know gross but it had to be done.\n*If you do decide to shave, use a new fresh blade every time you shave in order to prevent spread. Also if you have folliculitis on your legs don't use the same blade on your armpits etc.\n\nI looked up items on amazon and read reviews for \"Almond Clear: Body Clearing Serum\" https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0866B6CV1/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1\nI decided to give it a try, i started with Level 1 and used it with the Hibliclens antibacterial soap as everyone in the reviews did. I already had the soap since its so amazing and i recommend everyone have this\nsoap in their home it works miracles. I was already using this soap by itself for about 2 weeks prior to buying the Almond Clear bottle and i noticed no difference. When i read that buyers were combining both Almond Clear Serum and the soap i decided to do the same, but still i felt that Hibliclens did not do much for me. My Folliculitis was very stubborn!\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Molnlycke-Hibiclens-HIBICLENS-LIQ-OZ/dp/B00E5R65SA/ref=sr_1_3?crid=GNSU7PU7YVEN&dchild=1&keywords=hibiclens&qid=1590613599&refinements=p_85%3A2470955011&rnid=2470954011&rps=1&sprefix=hibi%2Caps%2C234&sr=8-3\n*Everyone is different so what works for someone might not work for others.\n\nAs for the Almond Clear serum, i noticed immediately a difference! overnight the lesions seemed like they shrunk.\nThe only complaint is that the bottle doesn't contain much. I had a big area to cover so 1 bottle was finished in 1 week. I would definitely recommend you purchase the bigger bottle so its worth your money (they have the 4oz option available). Also level 1 is more for someone who might have like 1-4 lesions..or for sensitive areas like the face. I felt like it made a difference but i definitely needed something stronger to completely get rid of them, i should've skipped to level2 like everyone else did in the reviews.\nI bought level 2 when i ran out of level 1 and i definitely noticed a huge difference! Listen to me right now, if you suffer from severe Folliculitis YOU HAVE TO BUY THIS!\nHonestly my case got so bad i had so many lesions on my groin area they started spreading down to my thighs and legs and even my private area :(\ni was so stressed i couldn't wear shorts and even pants would cause me to breakout in hives and the infected area\nwould get so red and irritated easily. It got bad!\nLuckily this product saved my life..I started using this April 20, today is May 27 and i am pretty much cured, the lesions are all gone and even the scars are faded! This product faded the nasty dark marks.\nThe reviews recommend using up to 2xs a day. This did not work for me, my skin is very sensitive so i would only use 1x a day, every night after i showered i would apply and leave overnight. I do have to say that this product makes your skin peel and drys your skin out. For me, it made my skin excessively dry and i would shed skin almost everyday.\n\nBecause my skin was getting beyond dry i decided to moisturize. I used CeraVe Moistorizing Lotion every morning when i woke up.\n*(make sure to always wash your hands before and after you apply a product to prevent from spreading to other body parts).\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YJ2SLG/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\nI used this lotion because alot of people with skin issues use this lotion and it works well, i had no issues, great product!\n\nI shower every night so i decided to use a Folliculitis body wash i found on Amazon. I leave it on the area for about 5 mins then i rinse. I also noticed a big difference with this product right after the 1st use! I used this product for about 1.5 months?\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GBL3RES/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s04?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nAnother product i used in the shower was the Nizoral Shampoo. I saw YouTube videos of people who used it on their arms and face to treat folliculitis. Luckily i already had this shampoo as well, its to treat dandruff, i recommend for both dandruff and for folliculitis, i feel like this items made a difference. I replaced the Hibliclens soap with this product, i leave it on the area for about 5 mins then rinse in the shower. I used this product for about a month.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AINMFAC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\nThe final product i used was Defense Soap, i used this soap in order to kill any bacteria or fungi that might have been causing the Folliculitis. I felt like this also made a difference and i washed my whole body with this in order to prevent any Folliculitis from spreading on my stomach or arms...I was terrified of getting it any where else, the soap makes you feel fresh and clean specially after a workout! It does dry your skin so you don't have to use everyday, but if you do i would definitely recommend to moisturize with the CeraVe lotion or just any lotion in general. I used this product for about a month.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HYBK2YF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1\n\n*Be sure to use these products EVERYDAY, TO SEE RESULTS YOU HAVE TO BE CONSISTENT.\nIf you are on a budget: Out of all the products i would definitely recommend you use the Almond Clear Serum and the Folliculitis Body Wash by Ovante. Yes i know this is a VERY LONG routine and so many products to use, but all my folliculitis is pretty much gone already! It is pricey to buy all these items, but honestly i was willing to pay $100+ in order to get rid of this and it was worth it!I guess it depends how bad do you want to get rid of this? I think its worth it!\nDo your research, find out what works for you, try different products until you find something that works for your skin. I HOPE THIS HELPS SOMEONE!",
                "* Disclaimer, this is a long review, but I'm so incredibly happy with the results that I want you to know how upsetting it was that nothing worked longer than a day until I bought this shampoo.\n\nI started getting dandruff in my late 20's. I'm 36 now. At first it wasn't bad and then it got noticeable to the point I was embarrassed. For reference I have really dark brown hair, thick and very long. I had literally tried every kind of dandruff shampoo and conditioner from stores to online to salon recommended. From $5 bottles to $35 plus. The only way they would remotely work is if I used them daily, but by the end of the day or next morning, I'd have the ugly white flaking or white piece stuck in the middle of a strand of hair. If I went two days without using them, it would be enough to notice even with my hair in a bun And headband. And I usually wash my hair every 3-4 days because I never needed to wash it daily.\nI randomly searched on Amazon again about a month or two ago for dandruff shampoo because now it was getting itchy and I was so upset every day to see my hair. I found this product with high reviews, Nizoral. I said to myself, I'm desperate and I'll try anything. I purchased it. When I first went to use it, it was super blue and I wasn't sure how it would leave my hair, but I scrubbed it all around my scalp, only one wash. Then I used my normal conditioner, Nexxus, not any kind of anti dandruff conditioner (because I have those too). I wanted to see what the Nizoral would do without also having to use an anti dandruff conditioner. And for another reference (there's a lot of these), I first used it after not washing my hair for about 3-4 days, with only using dry shampoo in between. I got out of the shower and didn't see white flakes. I let my hair dry naturally as I wasn't going anywhere and drying it is a 30-40 minute process which I don't like doing lol. But I love my long hair; it's a love/hate relationship.\nAnyways, back to this magical shampoo, I woke up the next morning and no flakes, no white stuck in strands of my hair, no grossness falling out of my hair onto my sink or clothing when I ran my hands through my hair or brushed it, nothing! I was so excited, but hesitant because I said let's give this the day test. Checked back at night, nothing. Checked the next morning, nothing. I went 4 days without one single flake before my head was a little itchy because of just needing to be washed.\nI repeated the Nizoral shampoo with my normal conditioner again, and same thing. Days and no flakes or itching. I literally cried I was so happy and couldn't believe the type of sorcery this product had bestowed upon my head.\nI am now on month 2 or 3 I think, and I use this once a week with my regular conditioner and the dandruff is just gone. And that is days in between without washing my hair. It also doesn't make my hair dry or feel gunky or anything. My hair is always soft and smells nice. I was worried something like this would give off a weird medicated kind of smell, but not at all!\nIf you have dandruff and nothing has worked or your tired of having to use something every day in order for it to work, just stop and buy this. It's not even that expensive and I have had two months of use from ONE bottle; again with that reference, I have hair down to my bum that takes 40 fricken minutes to dry with a blow dryer because it's so thick.\nHands down I would literally promote this shampoo anywhere, even though my dandruff has been a really embarrassing condition for me. I wish I had before and after photos, but my dandruff was pretty much gone after the first use. So I couldn't even get a before picture now and it hasn't come back.\nSeriously, if you made it this far, Just buy it!\n\n** Also, quick footnote, I do shower daily. I just don't wash my hair every day. It goes up in a tight bun on my hair days off in the shower, which usually will stay up the rest of the day because I work from home and between being a single Mom getting a 7 year old up and ready for school and morning chores and then working for 10-12 hours, I'm too lazy to style my hair. Now, I do use a normal dry shampoo in between hair washes. But I had that routine before I bought this product, so I know 100% the only reason my dandruff is gone is because of the Nizoral shampoo.\n\n*** Second footnote, I'm not being paid to write this nor was this some kind of promotional item I got to use to write about. I'm just that impressed and so happy with the results and I know there has to be someone else out there that is going through that struggle I did and I just want that person to feel the happiness I do right now.\n\n**** This is the longest review I've ever written in my life.",
                "I am what the internet would call a leech in that I read a lot of reviews but don't write many. I bought this shampoo about 3 weeks ago. I've always had dandruff in my beard, but it was getting to a point where I would itch my beard and it would be disgustingly flakey. It got so bad that I was doing a presentation for work with a suit on and someone thought I had crumbs all over my suit and started dusting me off. Yikes.\n\nEnter this stuff and I've used it about 4-5 times over the course of the last 3 weeks. Let's say it isn't snowing anymore! I actually don't really like the smell, but the effectivity is amazing! So, from someone who has beard dandruff, this stuff actually works. I'll update my review if that changes.",
                "As most people who have attempted to get rid of their dandruff, I have tried a ton of products and techniques. This is one of those purchases that I am so glad I made. Nizoral is the only thing that has completely got rid of my dandruff. I did some research and supposedly the medicated product that\u2019s in the shampoo gets rid of the bacteria that causes dandruff instead of just the dandruff itself. I now buy it at Walmart, cause it\u2019s convenient, but it works. It is drying, so as recommended switch between this and a less stripping shampoo until the dandruff is gone and then use as needed. The scent isn\u2019t my absolute favorite, but not bad by any means.",
                "Typically for dandruff related issues, the shampoo usually smells very neutral or more like chemicals. This shampoo has a nice hint of fragrance that is neutral to men and women. Both my boyfriend and I had used this product! I had a situation where my scalp has a flare up, and a lot of it was concentrated behind my ears and in the back of my neck. My dermatologist said it could be scalp psoriasis.... which was weird because psoriasis does not run in our family. I was prescribed this alcohol solution which I had to pour on the area which make it burn and hurt a lot. After some research I came across this and decided to give it a try. Within A WEEK my scalp was no longer dry, my hair smelled good and was so thick and full of volume! I haven't switched shampoos because I am honestly afraid to try something else. I will be ordering more soon. Very satisfied and highly recommend!",
                "I've had psoriasis since I was a teenager and I've always struggled with it on my scalp. My hair was always flaky. I tried coal tar, tea tree, head and shoulders, and MG217 and none of them ever fully worked, and generally all of them killed my hair.\n\nThis stuff completely eliminated all of my dandruff after about a month of use. My scalp hasn't been this clear in years. It smells decent and it doesn't dry out my hair. I wish I discovered it years ago.",
                "So, my scalp was bleeding, itchy, painful, dandruff, the whole nine. I went to a dermatologist who told me my scalp problem was called seborrheic dermatitis. Until this point, I thought I needed to try weird shampoos, and dandruff crap, and all that stuff, none of it really worked. The dermatologist prescribed me an Israeli shampoo with 2% ketoconazole. It was expensive and I used it up after a summer or so. Since then, I tried buying animal 1% ketoconsazole shampoos, then I found this. It's great. It's not 2% but I don't have to pay for a doctor visit or a prescription medication, either. So then I told my brother, who had the same issues. I told a bunch of people and everyone kept thinking, gee, I need to try tea tree charcoal salicylate blah blah blah, no, all you need is a ketoconazole shampoo to control a fungus. Apparently it's super common. The only real drawback is that you don't want to absorb a lot of ketoconazole into your system because it will counteract testosterone or whatever. So yeah, shower, rinse, follow some directions.",
                "I don't usually write reviews (I feel like everyone always says that), but I had to write one for this product. I have tried everything under the sun and so far this is the only product that has really made a difference, so I wanted to take some time and share my experience.\n\nI have naturally curly hair and if you know anything about curly hair, you're not supposed to wash your curls everyday, but I was at the point where I couldn't go more than a day of not washing my hair without having this weird stinky scalp smell and severe itching. I was also experiencing a lot of hair loss. I know some shedding is to be expected especially with curly hair but I felt like mine was almost scary. I tried everything from expensive scalp detoxes, scalp treatments, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar, salycilic acid, pyrithione zinc, washing more frequently, washing less frequently, you name it, I tried it. Then I found an article that said my itchy, stinky scalp may actually be from a fungus called \"malassezia\". Apparently, this fungus lives on the scalp of most healthy adults without causing any problems but the immune system of someone with dandruff may overreact to that fungus. which can cause inflammatory reactions like folliculitis, dandruff, and eczema. The article also said if you have an oily scalp (which I do) it's most likely not \"dry scalp\" and here I thought the reason my scalp was so itchy was because it was dry! The article gave some recommendations like salycilic acid and pyrithione zinc, tea tree oil, etc., but I had already tried those and none of them helped me. So I decided to try Nizoral. Nizoral's active ingredient is Ketocanozole 1%, which is an antifungal used to treat dandruff. I was at my wits end and decided before I go to the dermatologist I would give this a try and let me tell you, Nizoral has done me wonders. The horrible itching is just about gone. My \"smelly scalp\" has improved tremendously. I now can go more than just a day of not washing my hair and not have that the stinky scalp smell. I am shedding less too. I still shed, but no where near as much as I was. I did read some Amazon reviews for this product and many said that it caused them to lose hair, but for me it has actually helped my hair loss. I use it two times a week and will do so for 8 weeks as directed. It has a pleasant smell, It's not overpowering and certainly doesn't smell medicated. It can be a little drying though, but I just use a really good conditioner for my curls.\n\nMy review isn't intended to provide any type of medical advice, I just wanted to share my personal experience. For me, this product has been a life changer and I hope my review is helpful!",
                "I had been dealing with itchy, burning scalp after not washing my hair for a day or two. I didn\u2019t have any visible dandruff and my hair would get fairly oily after two to three days so I wasn\u2019t sure if an anti-dandruff marketed shampoo would do anything but after reading reviews of people in similar situations to mine I decided to give it a try. It ended up working miracles for me because i no longer deal with itching or burning scalp since using this shampoo. I use it once every 3 to 4 days usually and use my normal conditioner and hair products as normal and its been life changing. It is a bit drying so i apply a little extra conditioner to help but it hasn\u2019t had any affect on my hair texture or curls as i was a bit afraid of. Its a bit pricy compared to normal shampoo but it works so well its completely worth it. If you only use it on your scalp it can help you save product as well.",
                "I have been using other anti-dandruff products for years and they didn't work. I used Head and Shoulders and it made my hair look as if I was running through flour. I got a crew cut haircut and there was no white spots nor flakes. I have been using this product for a month at least twice a week. Nizoral smells nice, gets rid of dandruff and moisturizes my scalp. This product save me a trip from seeing a dermatologist.",
                "I used to have hard scale like skin(like an iguana!) on the sides of my nose..not anymore! Now I can actually feel when I touch the side of my nose! Highly recommend and girlfriend approved(she says I now have the skin of an Angel!)! I suggest lathering your face with it and letting it absorb while washing your hair. Good luck and enjoy! P.s. also works great on ridding any facial hair of dandruff!",
                "I normally don\u2019t leave reviews, but let me tell you about this shampoo. IT ACTUALLY DOES WORK!!! I was struggling with dandruff for a while especially since my hair is very thick and tends to get very oily and would cause a lot of irritation. I would use different \u201cdandruff\u201d product but only this one is the one that I\u2019ve tried that has actually worked for me!! Definitely would recommend using this along with some conditioner.",
                "I have a pretty bad skin condition and have tried almost every other product to help. Honestly, the only thing that ever worked was this. A little on the pricey side for a small bottle, instantly took care of ALL my issues. Full body even. Scent is light and sweet, leaves no burning sensations regardless of how used, gel is thick so less can be used for a lot of lather and fill. Even accidentally got some in my eye and it hurt nowhere near as bad as other shampoos and conditions made for bad skin. Perfect stuff, and the only product I know that uses that little 1% miracle that makes it work as well as it does. Even only a small amount can make a huge difference, meaning you don't have to cake your hair for it to take effect. Will be using this from now.",
                "I have tried a bunch of different products and honestly did not hold out high hopes for this one but a coworker recommended it so I decided to give it a shot. Its only been a few weeks but my dandruff has been greatly reduced almost gone, smells good to so I am excited !",
                "I've had very bad flaking and dandruff for my entire life up until 30 (now). To describe it, if I used the wrong shampoos, my scalp would quite simply look like a snowstorm when I ruffle it. I used all the traditional products which purport to help with dandruff (t-gel, head and shoulders, and so on).. none of them worked as effectively as I would've liked.\n\nSo far I've only used this product once, but I am already extremely impressed. I see almost no flaking the following day after using it. I've basically been looking for this product for my entire life. Fingers crossed it keeps working as intended",
                "this shampoo is the real deal. i\u2019ve struggled with a flaky, itchy scalp since i was a kid. i\u2019d shower/wash my hair and by the next day i\u2019d have itchiness, by day two i\u2019d have visible flakes. over the years i\u2019ve tried washing my hair more often and less often, i\u2019ve tried the apple cider vinegar washing, different scalp masks and essentially any low costing remedy i could find online, but nothing ever helped. i started using this about two weeks ago. i\u2019ve been using it just as the instructions say; wash once, rinse thoroughly and wash a second time, every 3-4 days, and let me tell you just from the first wash, the effect was immediate. there\u2019s no itchiness, even though i sweat a lot through my 8 hour shifts at work. i haven\u2019t seen a single dandruff flake since i first used it. maybe it won\u2019t work so quickly or effectively for everyone, but this genuinely feels like a miracle product for me. i don\u2019t think i can ever use another shampoo after this. the smell isn\u2019t \u201cfeminine\u201d or \u201cmasculine\u201d, it\u2019s just a gentle soapy smell and it keeps my hair smelling nice until the next wash. for anyone looking for relief, THIS IS YOUR SIGN TO BUY IT !!!",
                "I had dandruff for a long time and I was using the classical brands in hope that magically they will start working one day. I wish I had tried this shampoo sooner. After the first shower with this, dandruff and redness and itching were all gone. It is almost 8 weeks now so I will use it occasionally to see how often I need to use it to keep dandruff under control. I am also using the Nizoral conditioner to prevent dryness and manage my hair. I can't recommend this shampoo enough!",
                "Finally found a shampoo that works!!! I have been suffering from dandruff and dry scalp for last 20 years and hairfall due to this. I tried many shampoos and finally read reviews on this and bought the shampoo and Conditioner \"Pine Tar Conditioner by The Grandpa Soap Company | Tea Tree + Coconut Oil| Scalp Therapy\". After 3-4 washes my dandruff and dry scalp are completely gone and I can't believe it.",
                "I have had a flaky scalp since childhood. As a adult its been increasingly embarrassing to be flaking from bushing my hair to the side. Wearing hair back, seeing flakes on my shoulder or back. This has helped me so very much and I sincerely recommend it! I use it every 3-4 days and wash in between with my regular shampoo and conditioner. I also actually reallt like the smell of it! And if I needed to I just add conditiner after its washed out."

                "I started using these a month after I had my birth control implant removed. Sometimes it took up to 10days of taking a test EVERY morning to see a peak result and I had to get the timing right of testing after my period. I did get pregnant on a weird test result day. My period had ended 2 days before, I had 2 sticks left in my kit and I figured I\u2019d just use them rather than wait for 5 days after my period. I got a peak result! Twice! My husband and I didn\u2019t miss the opportunity although we were suspicious as to the accuracy of the results. The rest of my regular testing gave High results with no peak. Just shy of 4 weeks later, we got a positive pregnancy test! We used this test kit (new kit each period) for 3 months. I think my body was still trying to regulate itself after being on birth control for 4 years which gave us that weird test result. I stored my test kits in a cool dry place out of direct sunlight, used a new kit including test reader after each period.",
                "I bought my first one of this product off Amazon and it worked great, I also use the Pregmate Ovulation Test Strips along with the Flo app to help track my cycle and together they matched for peak ovulation days my last cycle. I even got a solid smiley and my Pregmate ovulation stick was two vibrant lines, so we obviously tried this day. A couple weeks later though, I got my period. This cycle though I realized I must have threw out the test holder for the clear blue ovulation sticks. So I went and bought another at Target, now mind you, I had already started using the pregmate sticks on days 11, 12 and13 before getting my new clear blue ovulation kit. Day 11, nothing, days 12 and 13, two vibrant lines. On day 14 I went to get the new kit. That day I got just the circle on the new CB test and a vibrant line and a faded line on the Pregmate stick. I decided to test again the next day, day 15, and this day I got a blinking smiley and a vibrant line and faded on pregmate, so we tried. Days 16 and 17 I got blinking smileys and the Pregmates looked like ovulation was done, a barely there second line. After reading more of these reviews, I wondered if my new test was faulty so I tested it with water and low and behold, I got a blinking smiley (that's the CB stick with that single bright blue line). We got a new test from the pharmacy and on day 17 I used all 3, the empty circle is the new test, the smiley (it's blinking) is the defective and then the pregmate stick. So, I guess if you get a good kit, it works but just be aware you can get a defective one.",

I bought these thinking that once I get my \u201chighest fertility \u201c happy face, I could go on the next night and see if that peak was still there. Nope. Upon reading the instructions more carefully wondering why in the world the happy face wouldn\u2019t go away, it basically said that I was at my highest peak and the face will remain there for two days. Uhh, what? Sure, I had sex that very early morning. Was I still at my peak though? Mind you, the egg is only viable for 12-24 hours. The night before, around the same time, 7pm, I had the flashing face, as well as 24 hours prior to that as well. For all I know, when it showed I was at my peak, the egg could\u2019ve dwindled shortly after, not allowing enough time for sperm and egg to meet. This kind of defeated the purpose to me. Why the test doesn\u2019t clear afterwards and allow you to test as much as you like, I have no idea. As much technology there is today, I\u2019m sure clearblue could\u2019ve stepped up and it so we can test not just once and get a highest peak, but as many times as we like. I hope the little booger made it in time this month before my egg vanished \ud83e\udd1e",

It's been doing it's job very well for the past three months, made it through an entire cross country drive already and seems to be holding up pretty well. We had concerns it wouldn't stay up against the whole seat as others have shown to flop down and not protect it, but its been holding strong. We only use one at the moment so we have the second as a backup in case anything happens with the first one. Definitely a must for a simple cover.",

Well it has been 4 years Mom upgraded her pilot and I was able to move these to my New Pilot looking Brand new still !!! I do not know of anything that I paid this kind of money for back in 2018 that stick is in great use. Brica makes amazing products! And I will always recommend them!

It covers the seat back very well and thus protects the seat from the kicking and dirt. It was easy to install ( maybe a couple of minutes at most) but in our vehicle it does have a little slack under the headrest. I tried to tighten but it didn't seem to help. This may just be because it is designed as a \"one size fits most\". The lower part though fits perfectly around the seat. Wiping this down is very easy which makes clean up a breeze! I currently can't comment on durability because we've only had it for a month or so. Overall, very satisfied with this purchase!",

                "These covers are amazing! We bought two brands and these are hands down the best. I didn't see any mention of it in the product details, but there is some sort of boning near the top that keeps the corners from flopping down. We have a 2013 Honda Pilot and the seat is covered perfectly. My daughter tends to climb in, stepping on the shoulder area of the seat, however the adjustable straps allow me to keep that area as well protected as the rest of the back. The other thing i liked better is the bottom strap that goes in your seat. It is adjustable, but is also elastic, so is VERY easy to get a good, secure fit and helps to conceal it, as it slides easily into the groove of the seat for a no- show look from the front seat. The simplicity with no pockets is also a blessing, in my opinion. Some may feel differently, but in a MN winter, I would go crazy trying to keep dirty snow and salt from building up in pockets. The flat surface cleans much easier than the other, pocketed set we purchased. We are planning to purchase a second set of these for my husband's vehicle as well!"

Excellent quality, I have washed each at least 3 times, I felt like it shrunk a bit in the dryer (maybe 2 inches), but it wasn\u2019t significant, probably because I used the high heat cycle, my fault. I would recommend and buy it again.",
                "I gave this 4 stars only because we ordered this from the \"Order Again\" page and the pads have changed. I was not unhappy with the pads but they were not the same even though the photo shows them being the same. Overall the pads are great, they wash up very well even after #2 soiling and are great if you have older pets. We use them for two, 15 year old cats. I line their bedding with these just in case they have an accident and they work every time.",
                "Purchased for my ageing grand aunt's bed, the pad covers a large portion on the bed (using two pads) and projects the mattress and mattress protectors and bedding. Protects against bed time accidents while sleeping",
                "These are great. Got them for my bunny habitat. He likes them, but they do shrink. I have washed them twice now, and they have shrunk (I am sure because he is on a rug, and I am seeing more rug then I did before I washed them, I estimate they shrank about 1-2 inches). Anyway, does work, just know they will shrink some.",

No bleach, No Hot water, and No hot dryer. I use wool balls to help them dry at a lower setting.\nI have no complaints. It does what I need it to do.",

I placed it on top of the bed sheet and when he needed to get up, he was stuck and couldn\u2019t comfortably move on it. This could have have been due to perspiration. Last night I placed the pad under the bed sheet and put disposable pads on top of the sheet. I think this will be the best solution. His skin isn\u2019t in direct contact with the pad.",

                "This is for an individual who has had several strokes and caused an incontinence disability. We were using a waterproof mattress cover with 2 disposable XL bed pads. They constantly leaked and it was expensive, and bedding had to be washed every day! These bed pads are large enough to cover a twin bed (shoulder to calves and full width) and it holds the fluid! They are standing up well with washing. I ordered another set to alternate them. They do at times trap water during washing but hasn't trapped the dirty water and dries quickly. They feel like a cotton quilt. Awesome product so far!"

                "We found these a few years ago and they are wonderful. They are perfect to add to our special needs child\u2019s diaper when we are going to be out for a period of time.",
                "Both of my sons had issues with peeing out at night. We tried different brands of overnight diapers and larger sized diapers and nothing helped. We\u2019ve been buying these for a long time and they are the only thing that has worked.",
                "My son 9 times out of 10 would pee through his diaper overnight. Didn't matter how snug/loose, whether or not I sized up 1 or 2, or how I put on the dang diaper. Most mornings my poor little baby was soaked :( I was originally going to suck it up & buy some overpriced 'overnight' diapers when I saw these in my search. I read the reviews (thank you to the one reviewer that suggested putting these on horizontally instead of vertically like a pad!!!!) & decided I'd try them out. Well now that I have used these a handful of times most mornings he wakes up dry or maybe a teeny bit of leak at the waistband (usually he would be soaked from diaper up to the armpit). These things are a lifesaver & I absolutely recommend for the parents with an overachieving nighttime bladder..well lack of bladder control ha. Buy these they are wonderful & when I run out I will definitely purchase more if he continues on like he has :) 100% recommend :) :)\n\nOh & the only thing I would change is that it would be cool if they were a tad shorter in length. Otherwise totally worth 5 stars.",
                "These are a laundry saver! My LO is one of those ones that pee A LOT during the night and would wake up completely soaked, along with all the bed pads and bedding. I was doing laundry every other day, if not every day because of it. I tried everything and exhausted all of my options & advice I was getting. Once I got the sposie pads, everything changed! They are thick & absorbs so much during the night. I was amazed how well they held up to my LO\u2019s peeing powers. And now, waking up with dry clothes & sheets. \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb They are even gentle on the skin which was very important since skin sensitivity & allergies are common with my LO. I highly recommend sposie pads to everyone who struggles with a child that is a heavy wetter. Or to anyone who just wants some extra absorbency throughout the night for their LO.",
                "Since he was six weeks old my now one year old has slept through the night. As much of a blessing as that has been, when he sleeps 12 to 13 hours a night (every night) he leaks through his diaper. Our first \u201canswer\u201d was to wake him and change him periodically through the night. But seriously, what parent wants to do that?? So our second \u201canswer\u201d was to put him in the next size up, overnight diaper. That worked well for about a month but he eventually leaked out of those diapers also. Not wanting to try wrapping him in TWO diapers at night, we found Sposie. Sposie IS THE ANSWER! Now, at just under a year old, our son sleeps through the night, wakes with a heavy diaper, but no more leaks!",
                "The first time we purchased these pads, they had an adhesive strip on the back. We liked those better than the pads without an adhesive strip (our current order of 6 packs of pads came without the adhesive strip, which was a disappointment) It took a few tries to determine the best spot from front to back in the diaper. The pads without adhesive tend to shift and can bunch up in the diaper. We absolutely love these pads. They extend the holding power of a diaper really well. Our child has a feeding tube and gets fluids constantly thru the night. Prior to using these pads she was having large diaper leaks that required washing clothing, sheets and mattress pad multiple times per week. They also work great on longer car trips. 4 stars only because the recent shipment came without adhesive and there was no chance to chose that option with ther order.",
                "These are amazing! My son has special needs and has to take medication in liquids, needless to say he pees a ton! We use these when he sleeps and on long trips. He only leaked through if we didn\u2019t put them in his diaper correctly. Make sure to put the seam part down towards the diaper. We started using them in his size 3 diapers and he currently is in size 5. We started using them when he\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night due to a full diaper. We\u2019d have to change his sheets and by then he\u2019d be completely awake. Not anymore! We all are getting a full nights sleep, and don\u2019t have to do so much laundry! We\u2019ll keep using them until he\u2019s potty trained. I\u2019m hopeful that these will keep working even if he has to use larger diapers. I was hesitant when my husband suggested using these, but now love them and won\u2019t stop using them!",
                "This product has saved our sheets! My son drinks a lot of water and would easily wet through a night pull up. Sizing up was not an option for our 95 percentile toddler but a sposie inserted into the pull up was just the trick! We used to have pee throughs the majority of the week but now we hardly ever see them! We never let our sposie supply run low. What a life changer. Also, here's a hint, pull it up in the front above their weiner for boys. The thing works like magic.",
                "Literally the best for overnights!! Unfortunately there isn\u2019t many diapers for younger babies for overnight that help absorb extreme pee\u2019ers!\n\nMy only complaint I wish the first size and the 4-6 size had the adhesive like the bigger one to help keep them from moving.\n\nOther than that we started using them when my LO was in Sz 3 diapers and now she is a Sz 4 and we have not had a leakage since using",
                "Without these pads, my toddler twins wet through their diapers every single night making mountains of pee laundry for their poor mother. We only use these at night but this review concerns twins so this is a 90 day supply for me. This would be a 6 month supply for someone using these just for overnight for one kiddo. That is awesome! This is cheaper than buying a separate supply of overnight diapers and these work better. I used to buy Huggins overnites and Pampers Nite diapers and they would wet through. Using these doublers saves me the laundry and wet pajamas as well as waking up to angry babies with irritated skin. I've used and reordered these several times. I'm pleased and would recommend these to anybody with a heavy night wetter. These would be great for a longer car trip and you could easily stash a couple in a diaper bag. They look like a very long thin maxi pad honestly but just the right length for front to back in your kiddos diaper.",
                "We've been blessed with a toddler who sleeps well at night. However, this means that by the time she wakes up in the morning it's been quite a while since her diaper was changed, and we noticed they were getting so full that they ended up leaking a bit. These diaper pads were the perfect answer. We put one of these in her diaper just before she goes to bed at night and they help absorb the extra fluid. No more overnight leaks! These liners can also be nice if, for example, you are about to board an airplane and might not have access to a changing area for a while.\n\nThey do add a little bulk to the diaper, but they are soft and lightweight so our daughter doesn't seem to mind them.",
                "These are great. Our 6 month old daughter started rolling over onto her belly every night. NOTHING worked - not overnight diapers, not going up a size, not even a maxi pad stuck in the top. The back of a diaper would be completely dry, the front SOAKED, and she'd have soaked through her jammies and wake up screaming at 3 am.\nA cousin mentioned these when I was complaining about this, and so I figured I'd give them a try. They do the trick! They stay in place, add extra absorbency in the diaper wherever you put them. They go almost the full length of her size 3 diapers, but basically the purpose is to double up the front part, and it fits the bill.\nThis way it keeps her snoozing soundly for 12+ hours! If you've got a baby who WILL sleep through the night, you'll do anything to KEEP them asleep, right!?",
                "These are great. I have been using these on my little guy (18 months old now) since he was about 15 months I believe...because he started sleeping through the night...about 12 hours straight...meaning we would end up waking up prematurely to wet clothes. Not anymore. What I USED to do was put them in the diaper (higher in the front for a boy) but lower than the top of the diaper so it doesn't leak over the edge. Thing is that these pads are so long, that in the morning he was always soaked in the front, but dry in the back by his little bottom. Then he started leaking again! So, I decided to do what another reviewer said, I folded it in HALF and put that right in the front of the diaper. This works like a charm. He can sleep ALL NIGHT and we wake up to a soaked diaper and soaked booster pad, but his clothes are dry...and that's worth it to me!",
                "Love this product! My 2.5 yr old was leaking through his diaper almost every night and now with the sposies he NEVER leaks.\nI had tried a few different diapers before trying the sposies but nothing else worked.\n\nI do have to add that in order to prevent the diaper leaks I have to fold the sposie in half and place it at the front of the diaper.\nAny other position and it would still leak. My son is a belly sleeper.\nThey are a bit expensive especially considering I ship them to Canada, but worth it.",
                "After reading reviews and seeing this product referenced in mommy forums, I bought it to use for my newborn. This product was a life saver (not to mention clothes and sheets saver) as my son was starting to get too small for his newborn pampers, but wasn't quite big enough for the size 1 pampers and would end up peeing through them. This helped my dilemma especially at night, as he started sleeping through the night and I didn't want to wake him just to change his diaper, only to have him soak through them. So adding these sposie pads to his nighttime pampers and during his in between stages has been very helpful.",
                "These have saved us from many sleepless nights! My 13 month old son was waking up everytime he would pee through the night, and sometimes he would pee right through his diaper. Now that we found sposies, he sleeps through the night and there are no more 2am bedsheet/pajama changes!",
                "I had never heard of booster pads until this-- our first baby. Our son had trouble \"making it\" in his diaper through the night. Even though we used the big name brand \"night time\" diapers it didn't matter--- he'd still pee through the diaper.\nSomeone steered us to diaper booster pads and it was a total blessing because finally he could sleep through the night. Simply place centered in the diaper and put on at last diaper call. By morning the diaper will be full but not overflowing. This SAVES lots of time cleaning clothing, blankets and bed sheets that get soiled if peed on. It also saves precious sleep when the child wakes up cold because their clothing/sheets get soiled.\nThis product works and is inexpensive in relation to all the time, effort and money it saves.",
                "These are a life savor! We started using these upon recommendation from a friend when our son was about 1. He is 20 months now and we use these at night. Very rarely will he wet through this and the diaper. These are a godsend! For a boy position a little higher in the front....like an inch of this should poke out the diaper.....if he's a stomach sleeper. And more even with the diaper front if you have a back sleeper. Either way point his penis down and you'll be good to go. We obviously order in bulk! Oh, and size up on night time diapers: so if in day you're in a 3...at night use these with a 4. And tighten the wait tighter than you'd think. I read that their tummies are big and full going to bed and as they empty their bladders during the night their tummy gets smaller so you end up with gaps in the diaper which equals leaks.",
                "My daughter would wake up with a completely full diaper and wet the bed because it was too much for the diaper to hold. Inevitably she would wet the bed. I was washing bedding daily for months! My friends told me about these and while occasionally she still leaks (because there is SOOOO MUCH PEE) it really works and has been a life saver!",
                "Before these pads, my little guy would leak and leak every nap and night. The amount of laundry was ridiculous. I tried different overnights diapers. I tried wrapping extra diapers around his leaky spots. I tried to change his diaper twice thru the night (that quickly ended due to sleep deprived crankiness). I tried limiting his fluids before bedtime. I tried diapers one size up, one size down. He always found a way to leak and be soaked by the time he woke up.\n\nThese pads are a sanity saver. Worked the first night we inserted one in his overnight diaper. No leaks! YAY! No more daily laundry. No more cranky wet baby. His pad and diaper were fully saturated but he stayed dry. Sometimes I put in two inserts when he is extra thirsty during dinner.\nSo much peace of mind now. So glad we found these ."

                "It is a poo paper holder. Simple really.\nAs it is kind of the cheaper version of the Delta Lahara range, you do have to expect a few corners cut.\nThe chrome is not perfectly smooth, it does show some surface contamination from the plating process.\nThe chrome is not very thick, it will wear with time.\nThe weight is good, these are pretty heavy pieces, so the castings are solid.\nI would strongly recommend measure 3 or 4 times before you mount the brackets on the walls, I did twice & I still have more slack in the rod than I would like to have as the holes were about 1/8\" too far apart on the 2 wall brackets. My fault more than Franklin's.\nThe wall mounting brackets are sound & mount easily. Use good screws with the right kind of screws & anchors for the wall substrate. If you don't you will have bad day & be unhappy. That is not Franklin's fault, it is user error.\n\nI have never been given anything for free from Amazon as apparently I am neither a prodigious enough reviewer, purchaser or just not funny enough to be worth anyone wanting to give me anything, so my reviews are as honest as you get....",
                "This oil-rubbed bronze towel bar was under $10 yet, installed, looks like any of the higher-end brands. Its profile is modern and slim; it fits two folded hand towels perfectly. One thing to pay attention to when installing is the towel bar itself. If you don't mind it 'rolling' when you put your towels on there then install away, but if it bugs you that it rolls, i.e. is not fixed solid and makes a 'rolly noise' when you pull at the towels then when installing the towel bar into the two end pieces use some tape around the bar ends to 'lock' the bar in place so that it doesn't roll when you pull the towels off.\nCan't believe we got this for such a low price and free shipping. Amazing, Amazon!",
                "The towel rod itself seems high quality and looks good. I'm taking off a star because:\n1) The instructions say to drill 1/4\" holes for the anchors in sheet rock, but that is too big. The anchors just spun freely when I tried to screw in the screws. I was able to keep one from turning with a vise grip, but I had to use a different anchor for the other.\n2) Unlike every other towel rack I've ever owned, the set screws use a hex key (Allen wrench) instead of having a slot head. That makes them harder to install since the wrench needs to be taken out after every half turn, and also means I have to keep track of the included hex wrenches if I ever want to take the towel rod down.",

To be fair, those other ones were on the space station, so it might not be a fair comparison.",
                "This piece was a perfect match to the Delta hardware we already had installed and was lower cost.",
                "So to match the rest of my decor, I used Franklin Brass to update all three of my bathrooms, I chose this beautiful sleek towel holder. I would have given it five stars, but the rod jiggles and rolls every time I use the towel, the fit is not snug. I'm going to have to wedge something in the rod socket to stop the movement and squeaky sounds every time the towel is used. It is beautiful and functional and is cheaper than the Delta hardware, but the fit could definitely be more snug.",
                "I bought these to replace some old wooden towel bars in my bathroom. The install was pretty easy, and they look great. The materials seems like good quality, and I hope it lasts a long time (I cant know for sure yet). Overall im happy with my purchase, and will likely purchase more items from Franklin Brass.",
                "I like this simplistic design and this brand was the cheapest in this style. I purchased two and one of the bars had a slight ding. I would prefer something longer but this is probably the standard distance between wall studs to ensure the towel bar is solidly mounted.",
                "I have used Franklin Brass Somerset hardware in all of my three bathroom renovations. The price is very good, comparatively against the Delta line, and the quality is very good - brass, no cheap plastic. The towel rod does roll a bit but this brushed nickel one is not nearly as loose as the chrome 24 inch one I also purchased. There is some movement but the rod doesn't roll loosely or squeak. I think it will be possible to either wedge a tiny piece of paper or put some glue inside the socket to prevent the rod from rolling. I love the look!",
                "This towel bar is a knock off from the Delta Lahara series. It comes with a paper template for easy installation. Even though you have a template, make sure you use a stud finder after making your bracket marks. If your bracket aligns with a stud, just make sure you use a different size drill bit since you won't be using an anchor casing anymore. This took me about 10 min to install. Once installed it was very sturdy and the towel bar itself does not roll around loosely like many towel bars. Has a nice even finish as well.",
                "Really pretty when up. I took me a while to figure out how to properly install in the correct and sturdy manner, had to check out some you tube videos, but it looks great up. Great price for this lovely addition to my bathroom",
                "Worked fine in my little bathroom for a normal weight bath towel. Not too hard to install. Nice finish.",
                "Nice, sturdy and well made. What else can you say about a towel bar. I bought it because it matched the other things in my new bathroom. No complaints so far.",
                "It looks so good nice and sturdy and thick instead of The flimsy ones that come to the house.",
                "Good enough for the Kids bathroom. I would purchase Moen or Delta for a better finish. The wall mollies wouldn't hold so I had to sub out other ones I had on hand. Took longer to engage the hex screws vs a Moen or a Delta.\n\nAlso DO NOT USE THE PAPER TEMPLATE. It was of about a 1/2 inch. Unless you like the bar sliding back and forth",
                "But it\u2019s gorgeous! Just make sure you measure before you order (especially if your bath is on the smaller side), That you have room to open your door without it hitting the towel bar.\n\nIt has a very nice weight to it too. A real quality piece!",
                "Just what I needed to match my existing hardware. You get everything you need to hang it on the wall short the basic tools to set the anchors of course."

So basically I bought enough to last me a full year.\n\nI got a total of 6 different scents, with majority being California clean. Can\u2019t complain because it\u2019s all random probability on what you get.\n\nThe scent is VERY strong for me, not sure what the other people are running into (maybe they didn\u2019t actually tear off the lid, lol?) The most I can do is 1/6 open or the scent is too strong for me, which is good cause it means it\u2019ll last.\n\nIt\u2019s NOT gel based which is good. I\u2019ve tried their gel based before which said up to 30 days and I actually got 2 weeks out of it.\n\nI definitely recommend this brand.

The other 6 scents were one of jasmine, cranberry, tropical, strawberry, bubble gum, and vanilla. What's nice is I got to try scents that I wouldn't normally try. Two of those fragrence cans were a bit dried out and only lasted about a week. But I found that overall they all last 30 days regardless of the \"flavor\". I would recommend buying this in bulk if you use them in as many vehicles as I do. If not you may be better off picking up the scent you prefer while at the car wash."

However, instead of just going going back to my order history and re-ordering - I did a search and came up with this one under Prime and thought it was the same. It's miles from the same. This one feels a lot cheaper in it's construction. But the biggest difference? The large back is held to the seat part by the armrests only! Yes, you heard correctly, by the armrests. The 44186 model connects to the seat itself... so much better engineering. The small part- \"back in motion\" piece has an L shape connector to the seat. The then seat has an L shape connector to the backrest. On top of that, the reason I liked the chair was it's ability to keep pressure on my lower back. I'm not sure if this is also a difference- actually think it's broken... but I can't \"lock\" the seat from leaning forward like a rocking chair. The other one definitely locks. So I will be calling their customer service line tomorrow. I'm a bit concerned though as their is a web address you can also use- when I enter the Item # and PO# it tells me there is no match",

                "I first purchased this whitening gel from my dentist. It works amazing but recommend bleaching trays. I use my Invisalign trays. You just open the syringe by twisting the cap/lid off and applying the bleaching gel directly onto the front parts of your trays. I rub it around with the tip of the syringe, a little goes a long way. If you use too much, the gel will gush out when putting in your trays. if the gel gets on your gums wipe it off! it will cause gum sensitivity. I set a timer for 30 minutes and repeat every couple days (unless teeth are sensitive) until reaching the desired brightness of white. It only takes freshening up twice a year for me. And I drink coffee and tea daily. I'm sure everyone is different. But I always get compliments on how white my teeth are...even if I haven't bleached for a year haha Needless to say this stuff works amazing! You can always use a cheap football mouth guard and form it to your teeth for your \"trays\". Just bulky but way cheaper",

                "Better buy than through my dentist",
                "These are very high quality and easy to buy on Amazon!",
                "Make sure you do your research on the time you should have them in. My dr told me to put them on overnight in my Invisalign retainer. DONT DO THAT. It\u2019s only meant to be a few hours at a time. If longer, it may make your gums sensitive for a couple days.\n\nOne drawback is you do need your own retainer. No other option to apply.\n\nThey do whiten after a steady use for maybe a week. You should see a difference.",
                "Works great",
                "Transform your dull and lackluster smile to one that will bedazzle. Flash those pearly whites after using OPALESCENCE.",
                "Na",
                "I found that some in the package worked and some didn\u2019t! The weakest ones hardly worked for me but the 20% I had one or two syringes in the pack that really worked! Maybe I got an old batch?!?!\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f Too expensive for them not to work! Don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll buy them again! \ud83e\udd14",
                "Same as the dentist sold and recommended for less.",
                "The gel is really hard and doesn\u2019t spread into the trays well, maybe expired or a dupe",
                "I\u2019m a person whose teeth could be whiter, so I bought these with a gift card I got for the holidays. I\u2019ve only used them twice, but here is my review.\n\nThese actually work, and even better I have had no problems with sensitivity. That\u2019s nice. But it would be nicer if these included mold able teeth trays. I had to buy those separate.\n\nOne thing I wish I would\u2019ve looked into more is how long you\u2019re supposed to wear these. For the 20% (what I bought) it suggests 2-4 hours for a single application! I suffer from fairly bad dry mouth, so 2 hours is the max I can go before I have to drink something. Also, I don\u2019t exactly have 2-4 hours of my day that I can give to these for multiple days in a row. I am busy like many other people are. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t have bought these if I knew that.\n\nI personally recommend this brand, but instead of these I recommend the prefilled trays that are offered. I\u2019ve read they only require 30 minutes, which is much more doable. Yes it\u2019s more money, but for me personally it would be worth it to save my time and actually be able to use them!\n\n3 stars because these actually work\n-2 stars because it takes at least 2 hours to use them",
                "I have NO IDEA why some reviews are trying to make people fearful of this product, but it\u2019s only been a week of me using it (3 hours a day, as instructed by my dentist) and the difference is night and day.\n\nI had custom forms made by my dentist (to keep the gel from sitting on my gum line) and I apply the gel into the forms, pop them in and set my timer. I need to note that I have VERY SENSITIVE TEETH (sensitive to cold, sweets and even hot temps sometimes) and so I\u2019ve used this paired with Sensodyne toothpaste and a fluoride mouth rinse. As long as it doesn\u2019t touch my gums, I\u2019m completely comfortable. No sensitivity. It\u2019s a game changer.\n\nMy teeth are already so white after a week, that even my family members have noticed. My teeth are whiter than the whites of my eyes, photos aren\u2019t doing them justice. Already getting so many compliments! USE THIS!!!!",
                "My teeth were getting really stained since I ware Invisalign\u2019s aligner while drinking black coffee. For the first time, I use it 4 hrs every day. On 3rd day, my teeth turned up very white and my teeth are starting to be sensitive, so I stopped. But result is very satisfying. Now I use it 1/week to maintain.\nI had used same product from dentist, so I know how it works and how it makes my teeth sensitive temporary. The sensitivity last only a few days and it will be gone.\nSome other people mentioned it, but you buy cheap painting brushes with narrow brush from Walmart or craft store, or even cheap eyeliner brush from Target. You take small amount of gel to the brush and paint directly to each teeth. Put your teeth aligner back and you are set for several hours.",
                "I put the gell in my retainer over night once a month and wake up to whiter teeth. Doesn\u2019t taste bad, not like much at all. No extra sensitivity to hot or cold afterwards. Dental exams have maintained as normal. No redness or soreness of gums.",
                "I've used this product for a few years and it seems to whiten teeth.\nThis is the first time I purchased from this vendor. When I opened the package, one of the syringe had a cut on the side and gel had leaked out. Very disappointed with quality control. Costing $5+ per syringe of teeth whitening gel, I am not happy with this vendor purchase.",
                "Teeth appear to be somewhat lighter. Can't objectively tell a large improvement. Was somewhat easy to use and apply . Most people will be turned off by the multiple steps needed to apply correctly!",
                "I use this product because it doesn't give my teeth as much sensitivity as the other brands. Was worried a lower % (went from 35% to 20%) wouldn't be effective enough but no issues there! Just one use for 2 hours and my teeth were noticeably whiter. Only need to use about 3-4 times for that real pearl white and then once a year for maintenance. Flavor could be more enjoyable, haven't tried the melon yet!"
