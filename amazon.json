And for just as long, have always set the can in the sink of medium hot water to warm up the cream before shaving. Never had one explode yet! My last order (from a different vendor) were different in the fact that there were no foil/paper labels on the cans, the labels were directly printed on the metallic cans and I never had to worry about the labels peeling off in the hot water. I noticed that this set of shaving cream have the foil/paper labels, so I suspect they are going to peel after a couple of uses, but no big deal. Just wish there would have been a way to know this before ordering.", "I made the mistake of purchasing this product, and meant to get the Gillette Series gel. I didn't know Gillette Series made shaving foam, too. Nevertheless, my rating of this product is not a reflection of my not knowing this (read: I will try to be as impartial as possible here!). I have since used this product, and it definitely is better than the foams I've used in the past. However, as other reviewers have noted, it's not as \"rich\" or full-bodied when it comes out of the can. The 'instructions' (nothing more than a graphic) does not say whether or not to shake the can (as with other foams). Either way (shake or no shake), when you dispense the product, it comes out rather thin, but seems to thicken up a bit, after a second or two. Overall, it's good foam, and I'd give it a higher rating if it wasn't for the 'watery' consistency when it comes out of the can. This can be a (minor) issue at first, as some if it might fall into the sink if you dispense it took quickly (as I have, before I got the hang of it and learned not to press the button too firmly).\n\nIn summary:\n* If you like foam, you may like this one. 3 stars for now, 4 1/2 stars if they can reformulate it to not be so runny upon dispensing.\n* If you prefer gel (as I do), you probably won't like it. However, I suggest trying it out buy buying a single can first, to see if you'd like it.", "I've been using this cream for some time now and I just realized I was able to get it in bulk packs and subscription services. I hate going out to the store to buy things like this (mainly because I wait until I'm out), so the subscription is good. If you are like me with 5 men in the house, you can probably use the six cans pretty easily. We aren't even that hairy of a bunch, so your mileage may vary based on your level of wolverinism and the number people you have.\n\nIn terms of the cream itself, I'm a big fan of foam over gel as you don't have to wait for it to foam, you get a better idea of how much you are using and I think it works better to lubricate and hydrate the face. Gillette's is good at all that. I don't have sensitive skin, but I've always used this because it seems easier on my face and it provides for a smooth shave.\n\nEverything said the cream itself is great, but a 6pk is a lot of shaving cream. Great if you have a lot of guys around (better yet if they are particularly hairy).", "Nice value for the dollar.\nNot sure what \"sheerness\" and \"thickness\" have to do with shaving cream so I can't \"rate\" them.\nI've used this cream exclusively for some time and it works well.", "This is a great shaving cream foam.

It is like getting almost three FREE cans with a three can purchase. Shelf life is not a problem either if kept in a cool place. No, the garage is a bad idea as is over the stove or on the mantle above the fireplace. This is a good deal.", "I wasn't able to buy my usual shaving foam (Barbasol) here on amazon.com without paying shipping and handling because for some reason only outside vendors carry it, so I decided to give something else a try, and this seemed like the best value. I haven't experienced any of the watery issues that some other reviewers have, and I wonder if it's perhaps because I hold the can upside down and shake vigourously before each use. Take note, this is a foam, not a gel, and it comes out all foam. I use it on my face and my head, and it does the job, with no bad smell or irritation. Not much you can say...it's shaving foam. It is what it is.", "I switched to the gel style shave products many moons ago when they first became popular. Then recently, by accident, I picked one of these Gillete foam styles off the store shelf. Because I didn't realize my mistake until a couple of weeks later, I decided to use it. I was pleasantly surprised to discover how much closer and easier it shaved compared to the gels. I tried brand B foam later and it seemed to be more air less moisture. The Gillete product does come out less puffed up, which is due, I'm speculating, to a higher moisture content. So the Gillette Foam is now my daily shave product.", "The can looked like the one he likes however it wasn't the gel he thought it would be.

I was bullied in school for my large pit-stains, and would always have wet circles under my pits, regardless of the temperature outside. I went through several prescriptions from my doctor, which only irritated my skin and made it itch and burn like fire, preventing me from sleep. I received a sample of this product through a female care sample pack through a clinic, and fell in love. I have now been using this deodorant for almost 10 years, and have never been happier with a deodorant. Yes, I still do sweat if it's really hot out, or while working, but that's to be given with any deodorant I believe. Applying this product at night and in the morning has solved the huge wet circles I was always embarrassed of.\n\nAlso, this product smells fantastic, and has not irritated my skin even after applying twice daily.

I only roll it up one \"click\" and put it on; you don't need much. But, my complaint is how darn hard it is to turn that dial, If you have hand issues, this may not be for you. I do not like smells in my products, but bought this because people said the smell was light and i either couldn't find or didn't want the fragrance free one (cannot remember now). The fragrance is not bad. It is lighter than many and doesn't smell for long. That said, if you are sensitive to fragrance, it is noticeable when you put it on.\n\nHave no idea how long it will last - given it's price, I hope longer than the last kind I used.", "Been using exactly this brand, exactly this scent since it came out. This deodorant, seriously changed my whole life. I have always been a sweaty armpit person (not a smelly sweaty, but constant sweat), and was SO insecure about it. All through junior high and high school I always wore a jacket over clothes, and didn't like wearing anything but colors that could hide the sweat, which was there even in the middle of winter. I put this on after showering, and don't have to reapply until my next shower, even if that is two days later. I thought maybe I grew out of the problem, but have tried over the years not using it, and a couple of times have forgotten it when I traveled, and I definitely still sweat like crazy. No other deodorant works even a little for me. This is THE ONLY one I can use with success. And it smells awesome! People sometimes ask me what perfume I'm wearing, and I tell them it's my D.O., haha. I don't like the other scents this deodorant has, and have a special aversion to the 'powder' scent (gag).", "Definitely one of my best and trusted tried and true, Go-Tod. Easy application, lasts longer than competitors, nice scent, and great odour protection!", "This has been my favorite deodorant for years, but now that we\u2019ve moved from the desert to a warm humid climate this is a life saver. I\u2019ve tried switching to the more natural (aluminum free) deodorants that everyone raves about, but I end up smelling and with soaked T-shirt\u2019s. Secret clinical strength never fails me, and I love the fresh light scent that doesn\u2019t overpower.

These deodorants always speak to the sweating, but not the odor which is my main concern.\n\nI will increase two two clicks each arm day and night.

Good points:\n- The lavender scent is mild and pleasant, not overpowering.\n- It seems to keep me smelling fresh.\n\nI'm not giving it a higher rating because:\n- The gel is extremely sticky/tacky and stays that way all day without ever absorbing into my skin although I apply a very small amount (1-click).

I tried these hoping they would be an economical version - while they are less expensive, I find that because they are thin and hard and not so absorbant, that I am using 3x the number of towels as normal. I really did not like these towels and felt I would rather pay a little more and get a better quality towel... Sorry, but that's how I feel in regards to using these BASIC towels for home use as a replacement for paper towels.

Nevertheless, this product served its purpose as replacements for paper towels rolls and disposable table napkins.\n\nIt's now close to the end of June 2020 and we still have a lot of these paper towels left. I packed the bundles separately in plastic wrap to protect them from moisture, contamination & pests. This also made it easier to store the paper towel bundles in our kitchen cabinets, instead of leaving them inside the box that they were shipped in.", "These remind me of the paper hand towels you find in common bathroom at a small office.

You get 16 packets of paper towels so these will last a long time. Each piece is 9 inches x 9 inches, so a bit smaller than my regular paper towels, but they work fine.\n\nMy order came in 5 days during the midst of the shortages.

They reported to me that the paper towels did not hold up as well as they need, and would rip or break up faster than what they were accustomed to when we were ordering a pricier paper towel brand. So, I switched to another brand that is slightly more resistant to tearing and falling apart. However, let me say this: I used these paper towels on occasion and found them to be a nice texture, albeit slightly thin. If you don't need heavy duty paper towels, these might work for you. It just didn't work for our needs because we perform clinical services and the paper towels weren't strong enough under those circumstances. Perhaps they might work better for home use, though.", "They are soft, absorbent and a value for the money.", "I normally use Viva or Brawny but during these times found it not economical. The paper towels are very useful and sturdy. Its your normal commercial type paper towel. It is not Super absorbent, however it will absorb small amounts at a time.

It doesn't lather WHICH IS GOOD, people! It doesn't have to lather to work well! It feels very hydrating as you wash, and the smell is predominently a fresh aloe vera smell for those who have had a real aloe vera plant and used it (aside from the very light citrus undertones which dissipate quickly and are not strong because they aren't synthetic perfumes) . It does feel a little drying once your face is dry but definitely clean, and nothing a little serum or moisterizer corrects. I am 30, have never had an issue wih breakouts mainly because I let my face rest: I don't wash it every day, I don't put a ton of products on it every day. I go bare-faced as much as possible and let my pores stay unsuffocated. As a result, my face stays clear and wrinkle free so far.

I can't tell if it is brightening my face, I just like how it leaves my skin feeling, clean.", "This stuff is great for my oily skin but doesn\u2019t seem over drying where my face is completely dried up with alcohol or something. It\u2019s a slippery gel type of consistency and it melts off my foundation. It smells like straight-up, real, fresh orange peels. I\u2019ll lather and leave it on my face in the shower after my pores have opened up a bit and it will start tingling and slightly stinging but not in a bad way .. as if I can feel it settling into my pores to deep clean. I\u2019ll rinse with cooler water and my face looks brighter and a bit smoother too as if it eats a little bit of dead skin off of your face. I have very oily acne prone skin.", "I like this cleanser - it does a good job of cleaning without stripping my face dry. My skin can be sensitive, but i have never had a reaction to this. The gel consistency keeps it on my silicone scrubby pads without falling off into the shower , and it foams up just enough - dense but not extravagant and hard to rinse off.", "I\u2019ve been using this product for about 3 years now. The store I used to buy it from stopped carrying it, so I decided to start buying online. I love this for my combination oily skin. I can see the difference after using it and how my skin looks brighter after use. And it doesn\u2019t feel either oily or dry after use. Skin just feels clean. I have significantly less breakouts now. And, I\u2019m convinced the vitamin c is keeping my skin looking young as people always seem to think I look about 10 years younger than I am. This is especially important to me, because I haven\u2019t always had nice skin. I recommend this to others.

I kept trying so many different cleansers that I finally decided to try soaps I previously used when I was younger with acne. This is a pretty reliable soap for me. Prevents pimples and feels like I get a good clean. It's a tiny drying though, but I have found that's pretty typical with vitamin c cleansers or cleansers that prevent pimples. So I would rather have to moisturize than have pimples. The scent is nice. It's sweet smelling almost like a sweet cereal like fruit loops.", "I Love This Product and it is a powerhouse product.

I saw immediate results in lightened pigmentation (freckles, sun spots, left over pregnancy mask). My skin loves these products. The first time I used the toner, it felt and looked like it was burning my skin a bit so I took a wet washcloth and washed it off. However once the redness went away, my skin looked amazing! I realized that the toner is just really strong, so after that, I diluted it with water and saw less irritation, but still great results. The cleansing gel is much milder but still effective (I backed off the toner after the first time and was just using the gel alone for a few weeks). Since I now know that my skin handles the gel well, I typically scrub it into my face at the start of my shower and leave it there until I am ready for a final rinse. I follow up with the toner when I feel I need it. I have been getting so many compliments lately about how great my skin looks. I am hooked and especially love that it's mostly natural!", "I\u2019ve been using this face wash for years. I love that it cleans my face at night without over-drying it, and I love the scent. I am really scent-sensitive, but the fresh orange smell of this is lovely.

I follow this cleanser with a Retinol serum and the Avalon Organics Intense Defense moisturizer. In the mornings I use the Avalon Organics Cleansing Milk.", "Love the product but when it came it was leaking out everywhere.

I also need products that require the least amount of my effort or time.\n\nI looked long and hard for a good facial cleanser that is reasonably priced. I navigated quite a few bad products along the way, several of which were not cheap. Very few facial cleansers left my face feeling \"Clean but not stripped\".\n\nThis product does this for me - my face feels clean, refreshed but not stripped or dry after. I pair this cleanser with a very light moisturizer and this combination works really well for me. One of these bottles lasts me quite a long time.\n\nIf I had a complaint, it would be that the bottle doesn't travel as well as I'd prefer. It's one of those that you have to turn the nozzle, pumping out the current contents of the pump, in order to lock it. And if you mess-up the first time, you get to pump out yet another squirt while you try to lock it (before packing it in your suitcase). This is the only reason I give this product 4 stars instead of 5.", "The scent, the texture, the way my face feels (moisturizes, not drying), the price - it all comes together in this product. It works!", "With my combination skin (some parts oily and some parts dry), I prefer a gel cleasner. I was originally introduced to Aveda's gel cleanser which is what got me started on that type. Recently I was using one from a company called Lemongrass Spa, but with it being a direct sales company it was a little pricier that I wanted. And no free shipping...and let's be honest, with Amazon Prime who wants to pay shipping anymore??? So I did a search and found this gel cleaner and decided to give it a try. So far it's working out well. I like this brand anyway, so I am happy to add more of their products to my lineup.", "After much research and considering price and ingredients I decided to order this for my severe perioral dermatitis. I am so happy with this that even though my skin has cleared up, I will continue purchasing this cleanser because it is that good! It never leaves my skin feeling irritated or stripped. The smell is nice and fresh and yes, it does a good job of removing makeup. This cleanser does foam (not like crazy) but it does foam enough to where you feel like \u201cyes I\u2019m clean!\u201d. Highly recommend", "My face doesn't get nearly as red with this face wash as it does with others. It doesn't dry out my skin, and definitely helps brighten it up some. I've been using it for weeks now and I think I'll stick to this one. My skin loves it. I'm naturally prone to acne (hormonal and excess oils), have a good amount of redness at any given time & have somewhat sensitive skin. This feels so refreshing, like my skin can breathe finally without stripping off my whole dermal layer. Like I said, my face gets a bit red with this one but then totally balanced out after a minute. It's not totally moisturizing but it doesn't dry me out either."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0001FSWMM", "title": "Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass Weight Gainer Protein Powder, Vitamin C, Zinc and Vitamin D for Immune Support, Chocolate, 6 Pound (Packaging May Vary)", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T2/images/I/61dIE57qUUL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "62,843 ratings", "description": "Serious Mass is the ultimate in weight gain formulas.

I've decided to 'give back' too and not be so selfish thus, make it a habit from now. What better way to start off than with the products i've used and appreciated so much?\n\n*IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ EVERYTHING, THIS'S JUST ABOUT MY CONCLUSION TO 1st TIME BUYERS OUT THERE* BASICALLY ;\n\n1. Be sure to workout intensely (esp. your tummy area) to prevent belly fat (cause trust me, it is real) like the plague\n2. If you find the mixture too sweet for your liking you could always dilute it with extra milk, some water, or anything other thing that works for you instead of complaining & whining about it and trying to force it down\n3. Mixing the chocolate & vanilla flavor (with milk) was something i wish i'd figured out sooner. I couldn't have asked for a better taste.\n4. If you're a hard gainer, you can be assured that this product WILL do something for you (if you take it properly and workout well it would do a whole lot more than that).\nI would know because i'm a serious hard gainer myself and wouldn't even say i 'used it that properly' at all but, in the end i did see noticeable gains and got weight gain compliments for the first time in all my life.\nI'm sure if you eat well, train really hard, and take this alongside you'd be just more than fine!\n5. It has some kind of \"very sweet after-taste\" though, which lasts for some time. (could be up to 12hrs or more) even if you keep eating things in-between or after you take this. What happens is soon as your mouth becomes empty for some time you start to \"feel the taste all over again\". I find it very annoying lol but it's the ONLY PROBLEM I HAVE with this product. I'm ok with any other thing.\n6. Remember to check with your doctor before taking this (if you have any health issues or are on medication or any other supplements).\n\nMy \"testimony\"...(if you're interested) ..\n\nI'd never gained above 5 lbs in such a short time my entire life! I weighed 42kg (92 lbs) before i started my weight gain journey in September 2014 and by the time my serious mass got finished (i visited a hospital in January 2015), checked my weight and it said \"50kg (110lbs)\"\nI'd never gone past 45kg my entire life! Even when i received those \"you've put on weight compliments\" when i was younger, highest i prolly was that time was like 43kg. Because of this i thought there was a mistake in the scales they were using at the hospital two year ago. because at that time i wasn't even taking the serious mass anymore cos it had finished about a month or so ago and i'd stopped working out for about a month or so as well.\nI actually asked the doctor \"um,are.. you really sure it's 50?..didn't it just say that because of my clothes or something?\" (and i'm someone who'd never asked a doctor \"are you sure\" ever in my life!) ... I mean i knew i gained some weight all right while i was still 'on track' with this, but then i knew i'd 'stopped my journey' and wasn't even doing anything anymore so i had definitely lost weight again. That's why i was so surprised! I mean, i had a mirror in my house and all ok?, but i guess because i was constantly looking at myself almost every hour on my gain journey i never actually realised that i had gained!\nIt really was 50kg. I had gained 7kg in 2 months!\ud83d\ude07 (A HARD-GAINER) i want to stress on that again. LOL\n\nI found it really hard to believe so i had to check again during that week with a different scale (for some weird reason i didn't have a scale at home and always had to check outside of the house) lol i really wasn't serious. I checked and got the same measurement to my uttermost surprise. I didn't believe it (still) ... but then after some time i finally got over it & accepted it.\nThat was when it hit me... \"Oh, wow..does this mean i gained even more while i was still on the serious mass?\" ..\"umm.. Huh? \" And then it hit me again... \"this is the first time i've reached 110lbs! ...omg..*my eyes filled with tears* About a year ago that was actually my dream.. to get to 110lbs, and now i'm here! What is this?? How did this even happen?\"\nWell yeah, i WAS extremely confused for a long time. Trust me on that one.\n\nWELL ABOUT WORKOUTs;\n\nI used to do normal 'home exercises' and i never even went to the gym. I had a workout routine, but because i'm severely anaemic it was always extremely difficult for me to workout properly (and the way i REALLY wanted to). So i did basically some 'soft workouts'.\nI didn't have dumbbells at the time, so all i did was basically \"no dumbbell home exercises\" or \"workouts without weight\" more like it.\nThis is why i was so surprised i gained. I realised that if i'd used weights i would've gained even more. I did squats mainly, (different types of squats) and then some donkey kicks and tummy workouts usually. I normally followed \"fitnessblender\" videos on youtube, and then some other fitnessmodels' videos that i found.\n\n*****I bought 2 chocolates 1 vanilla the first time i ordered this product (yes, it was a huge risk i took but this is just how much i believed in this product even before i tried it for myself). I fell in love with it and knew right from the times i researched about it that it was the RIGHT one for me. That was what i needed tbh, and i just knew. I don't know how but oh well, it did pay off in the end so i guess i was just very lucky*****\n\nI never really experienced any form of 'super strength' or felt 'so strong' to do my workouts or anything whenever i used this DURING workout, (and i would not blame it on this because i already had serious low energy problems from my anemic condition), and plus it even says to use it mainly as \"between meals, post-workout & before bed\" in the description (which i did, but also used it as a pre- and during-workout shake as well) so um, because of that i'm not gonna say it didn't do much or help me with my workouts at all. I used it as a pre-and during workout shake mainly because it had creatine and i thought it would help me workout better and easier (But maybe i didn't experience that much of a change in strength/performance because the creatine content is really small? idk) but then i do know it helped me in all sorts of other ways nonetheless. I RECOVERED FROM MY WORKOUTS REALLY FAST and that was an incredible one.\n\nFOR THE TASTES;\n\nTHE CHOCOLATE; wasn't bad at all when mixed with milk.\nI used non-fat milk as they recommend, but then always added some extra cup or so of full cream milk after i got my serving (to dilute it a bit). This was good, i liked better the taste it gave me when i did that, but then the downside was that it increased the amount of the shake and so was always a bit harder to push down quickly.\n\nTHE VANILLA; wasn't bad either. I actually grew more fond of that after sometime when i'd taken the 2 chocolate bags for so long. I liked the taste of that too, but again, it was also way too sweet for my liking when mixed with milk (esp the after-taste). so i'd always add some extra full cream milk/a little water to it to dilute that a bit as well after i'd reached the serving size.\nAfter a while, i started mixing both flavors together and IT WAS GOOD! (i only had a few cups of the chocolate left when i figured this out, so i couldn't do that for long, but then with the few days i did that, i never regretted)!\nI would take one cup of the chocolate flavor, one cup of the vanilla flavor, blend them together, adjust a little with some extra milk, and i'm all good!\n(I always said to myself \"why didn't i think of this earlier?!\" lol)\n\nIn general i never tried any with just water but my brother did once and from the look of things, it's clear they both taste better with milk.\nI never tried mixing either with other solid stuff like peanut butter, oats & the like because i mostly used to blend them with other liquid nutrition shakes (and they always blended well) but i'll try mixing them with dry oats and some other solid stuff this time and see. I'll be sure to leave an update later!\n\nAnyway, to continue my \"testimony\";\n\nIn the beginning i couldn't eat any solid food the rest of the day after i took this in the morning. It filled me up more than a 3 square-meal ever would have so i was always worried i was going to end up relying on that and use that as my 'sole source of nutrition' the entire time.\nGood thing was.. after a while it SERIOUSLY 'OPENED UP MY STOMACH'' and i was able to eat more than i ever could have handled on my own usually. That made me very happy indeed\nI knew it was the work of the serious mass because that was by far the most caloric supplement i was taking.\n\nThe other products i took alongside (more for medical conditions & clinical purposes)were ;\nScandishake vanilla -580 calories\nEnshake chocolate- 600 calories\n(That was probably why i gained so much but i know the serious mass contributed greatly too!)\n\nOh and, ABOUT THE BLOATING THING PEOPLE SAY..\n\nWhat i'm gonna say is it is really true. And i realised it when i experienced it myself. (I already believed and was aware from what i'd read even before i bought the items, but i guess i just didn't think it would be that serious!) lol Yeah, the bloating is SERIOUS as well.\nI had read that you have to workout insanely if you didn't want to end up putting on ONLY FAT so i was already prepared for that. *Only i wasn't as prepared as i thought i was* lol\nBut then to be honest.. with all my 'daily ab workouts' and the like.. i still did have a big tummy while on this mass gainer! lol I probably didn't workout as hard but all i know is i gained weight in the places where i wanted to gain all right, only it came with a lot of belly fat too! I didn't even care at the time though, cause at the time i was far too happy with the gains and knew i could workout later to reduce the belly fat.\nIt was only funny because i'd always been a skinny girl, and i'd never seen my tummy so big (i was actually afraid at some point that it was going to stay that way and it would never go back to the way it was! lol).\n\nI mostly felt 'bloated' and i think it's because i wasn't used to having so much calories in my body. I felt so 'heavy' and 'so pregnant' all the time because i was always so full! lol it was a struggle. But i managed to pull through it. After some time of going off my weight gain journey i got my flat tummy back! :) I know what to do this time if i started my journey again so i doubt that would happen anymore! I will train harder than i did last time so i'm very well prepared i must say. So should you! \ud83d\ude0a\nI would say it was fun though! The whole experience was fun and exciting as i'd never had that much CHALLENGE thrown at... well my body..ever! I was new to working out and all these mass gainers and the like. I gradually grew from there over time.. and now i know so much more than i didn't (two years ago) about mass gainers, workout routines and the like.\n\nI'm still attached to serious mass (yes of course, the love is still there!) and i would keep on buying until i've reached the goal i've always wanted to reach. (which is around 60kg or 132 lbs. I weigh 40kg now, that's about 88lbs yeah, unfortunately.. i lost all that weight in the course of just 1 year and i'm 21 now (which means very much underweight since i'm only 5'3) which is why i'm getting myself more bags of this product)!\n\nFunny thing's, i'm not even in the United States or Canada or the UK. I'm not in a country where i could easily get this product when and if i want. But then i still manage, and do all i can to get it every time (If i told you how much trouble i go through and how much money it costs me every time, you would marvel!)\nThe number of things i could buy with the amount i spend just trying to get 2 bags of serious mass down to where i am... it's ridiculous but oh well, when something's worth it you're never really bothered so this should tell you just how much useful this product is!\nThose of you who can just order it and get it the next day or two (and at this price with no other extra costs), be very lucky and make good use of it.\n\n(I'm not getting anything for this review just so you know, i do not know the company or haven't had any agreements to do this with whatsoever. I took time & wrote this review wholeheartedly just so future buyers would know what a great product this is just in case they were having any doubts) \ud83d\ude0a\n\nFor hard gainers... i'll DEFINITELY recommend!", "I gained 15-20 pounds in a month. No signs of slowing down. I am male, 5\u201910\u201d and have floated around 160-165 pounds for years because of a fast metabolism and an inconsistent appetite.\n\nThat weight gain came after using about one bag of protein powder + regular meals. I use one serving (2 scoops) per day (with a few missed days bc\u2026life), but I use very scant scoops (helps it lasts longer). I *highly* recommend using a blender to mix this thoroughly. I use my simple Nutri Ninja Pro. When you\u2019re done blending, pour the shake in a cup and clean the blender immediately every time to make your life easier tomorrow. It\u2019s much tastier blended with ice (about 1/2 cup) to dissipate the sweetness \u2013 it\u2019s also more refreshing with little pockets of cold. I use whole milk instead of water, about 3/4 cup. Blend in more milk until the consistency is acceptable to you, like a milkshake rather than like pudding (eck).\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a heavy drink and sometimes makes it difficult to eat other food, so I usually try to drink just 1/2 in the morning, stick the rest in the fridge, and drink 1/2 at night.\n\n~~\n\nI\u2019m noticing full body gains, but most prominently in my legs (thighs and glutes) and arms. It seems to be mostly muscle. I highly recommend adopting a regular exercise routine, including weights, for the best results with this. I think working out helps ensure your gains are in line with the physique you want, if you have physique goals.\n\nI started doing StrongLifts 5x5, which only requires 3 workouts per week. Takes about 45 minutes and it\u2019s 3 basic compound movements/lifts per workout, done every other day. I swim laps on 3 of my \u201coff\u201d days with one completely off day. So, I\u2019m always getting a full body workout, although SL 5x5 has you squat in every workout, and that really develops the lower body \u2013 and, conveniently, working your lower body enhances the rest of your body\u2019s growth.\n\nDo whatever you want, but it\u2019s nice to keep it simple and consistent.\n\n~~\n\nThat\u2019s about it. Drink plenty of water (it can dehydrate you in the beginning) and get enough sleep. This stuff works well.", "*THIS REVIEW IS FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LOOKING TO SEE IF YOU CAN DRINK THIS AND GET RESULTS WITHOUT WORKING OUT...... READ AND LEARN FROM MY EXPERIENCE!!*\n\nI was always at the 150-160lbs range my entire life and looked skinny even though my height/weight BMI said I was basically in the perfect range. I tried eating more and drinking more of these, went through about 5-6 bags but wasn't religiously taking in as much calories as I could to try to gain some mass/fat/weight...\n\nAs the title says, this is for whoever might be NOT working out and looking to buy this.\nTwo months ago I went thru some crazy epiphany evolving ego death and glimpses into the future of where my soul would go if I kept doing the negative stuff I was doing, etc of which I'll spare you the details.\n\nI weighed myself and I was exactly at 162lbs.\nI can't cook for #$$% so I asked my mom to make some homemade food for me that I could keep in the fridge/freezer so I could eat 3 \"real\" meals a day and not just fast food. Being the best mom in the world that she is, she made me 3 meals a day and I would just go to her house to eat most of the time to eat with the family. After every meal, I would drink a full serving of the Serious Mass. I used whole milk, 2 heaping scoops, 3 big spoonfuls of peanut butter, huge drizzle of honey, and a drizzle of Hershey's Chocolate Syrup. I didn't notice much difference until about a month of doing this. I tried wearing a few shirts that had fit me loose, but now they were almost stuck to my body (but I still didn't have a FAT belly). I did notice overall \"gains\" in mass in my upper chest/shoulders and especially my upper back. Remember, I NEVER ONCE WORKED OUT OR EXERCISED DURING ALL OF THIS.\n\nFast forward to the end of the 2nd month and now I have a visible FAT BELLY THAT I CAN'T EVEN SUCK IN - WHEN I DO SO, I CAN STILL SEE THE FAT AREAS.... Before all this, my stomach was flat and had NO FAT, when I sucked in my belly it would slightly go IN..... NOT ANYMORE.....\nI'M TYPING THIS WITHOUT A SHIRT ON, SITTING AT MY COMPUTER, AND I SEE 3 LAYERS OF FAT ROLLS DESCENDING DOWN TO THE LARGEST ROLL THAT STOPS RIGHT ABOVE MY WAIST LINE. I NOW EVEN HAVE SOMEWHAT OF \"LOVE HANDLES\". I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MAKE FACES WITH IT. I CAN GRAB MY STOMACH AND MOVE THE ROLLS AND MY ENTIRE BODY MOVES WITH IT. WHEN I WEAR A PLAIN TEE SHIRT, MY STOMACH STICKS OUT AND IS VISIBILE (NOT THE ENTIRE STOMACH THANK GOD, BUT THE MIDDLE SECTION JUST KIND OF POKES OUT AND THE SHIRT RESTS ON IT IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN). I TRY TO INHALE AND SUCK MY BELLY IN AS HARD AS I CAN AND IT ONLY WORKS FOR A MINUTE BEFORE I HAVE TO EXHALE AND MY BELLY JUST PLOPS RIGHT BACK OUT.\n\nFOR 29 YEARS, I'VE NEVER GONE ABOVE 170lbs - I WAS ALWAYS 150-160LBS WITH LEAN MUSCLE.\nI AM NOW CONSIDERED \"OVERWEIGHT\" ON THE BMI INDEX - 30 IS \"OBESE\", MY CURRENT NUMBER IS 29.1 !!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'm typically too busy at work to eat properly, so I had been cramming all of my calories in at the end of the day which was causing my metabolism to yo-yo. I was eating so few calories during the day my body was freaking out and hoarding all the fat and going into starvation mode. I now have one to one and a half servings of this product during the day and it has completely stabilized my metabolism and weight. I have tried MANY other products for this purpose from expensive meal replacement shakes (Huel and Quest) to protein powders of all kinds and they have all tasted nasty, caused upset stomachs and diarrhea, or both. I am happy to say this product has never upset my stomach or caused digestive problems, and it tastes so good (chocolate peanut butter flavor) that I look forward to drinking it each day. I only use cold water to mix it since I don't have to mask the taste, but it is more shake-like if you blend it with milk and ice. Great product!", "this product has helped me tremendously. I have an insanely fast metabolism so gaining weight has always been difficult for me. in about a month or two I gained close to ten pounds. starting at 115. two scoops is one serving size but I fully recommend using one scoop (half a serving). half servings are like regular shakes and are much easier to drink then the intended full two scoop serving. a full serving of any mass gainer is extremely thick and almost like sludge. the flavor on this powder is good and only tastes chalky if you don\u2019t properly blend.

You will gain weight doing that, even if you're just having one large actual meal a day, but now I just make a shake in the morning, However I just found out from my girlfriend that they sell one of these for $24 at Walmart so don't buy it on here it has gone up a few dollars every couple months for the last 2 years this used to be $30 on Amazon, don't get suckered in with their inflation prices this is price gouging like when people were selling rolls of toilet paper for $20 a roll during the plandemic.", "I've used this product for around 2 years now.

Not heaped as it recommends, but about 4/5 a scoop to prevent spilling when taken out of the bag.\n-Liquid: I used whole milk (about 20oz. If using less than it becomes too thick and grainy). It makes it more smooth and creamy. Water will work if needed, but I do not recommend it. Lower fat percentages of milk are alright, though the lower it gets the more it leads to my water comment. Almond milk makes it thicker, adds its flavor to it and yet also somehow makes it watery.\n-Blender: Ninja QB1004 48oz blender. Mix for few seconds, do something for few minutes, mix for few seconds again. Ensures complete incorporation.\n-Eating: 35oz is too big, so I pour it into a bowl.

Ordered this and used it for about 20 minutes in tank. Open black water valve let it run. Then close it let it run open it again. Do this often. Beware!!! Make sure you have someone outside opening and closing it. The tank will fill up fast and over flow. You need to shut water off to toilet for the cleaning wand is put down in tank. It forces water out at end spinning. Lesson learned. Do not take out of tank without shutting water off on the unit!!! Works great!!!! No more smell.", "This wand worked great.

I modified the entire thing. my pipe goes straight down, I measured from the bottom of the tank to the top of the toilet valve, then from the top of valve to the bottom of the pipe 17\". the got a 2\" PVC pipe which fit exactly through the opening in toilet so to not disturb the gasket around valve I don't use the shut off valve on the stick, I connected a regular hose nozzle to the stick, just turn it on and use the lock on thing on nozzle, after centering the stick inside the PVC as best I could, I drilled and tapped 1/4x20 holes saced evenly all the way up the PVC 3 at each interval and used stainless s thumb screws, counting the turns to get it centered at each cotact poing just snug against the stick. make sure to use hose washers wherever the hose screws in I use grease on all hose washers to keep them soft grease both sides of washers. once all is centered and screwed snug with tuimb screws I drilled 1/4' holes along the stick and filled with spray foam insulation and trimmed off any excess out the top and bottom at the brass swivel . then paced 3 1/4x20 thumb screws exactly 18 inches from bottom of the swivel leaving the thumb part out from the PVC to keep it from falling to the bottom of the tank.\n\nIv'e read the reviews about not enough pressure, the trick to more pressure, is to pass as much water as possible through the smallest amount of area as possible. I relaced the airater in the bathroom sink with an airater with a hose connector on it, turn off the hot water heater so can use all the water coming in and not trying to heat the water passing through, I even put a shut off valve on water going into toilet so that water is going through the stick and not just running into the toilet serving no purpose other than filling the tank. I also bought a high pressure washer hose which looks more like a 3/8' hose rater than the standard 1/2' or 5/8'= smaller hose=more pressure, yes my swivel did stop spinning one time, but at the speed that thing turns it's going to get hot the water passes through it not around it keeping it cool it needs lubrication I plugged the two holes in the swivel with fresh bread, opened the shut off valve on the stick, used a funnel abd poured it full if 5-30 oil, hooked up the regulat hose nozzle, turn the ater on full blast and locked it, the bread will hold the oil in until the water is allowed to go through.once the water hose is hooked up open the shut off valve on yellow stick, the water will push the oil, pushing the bread out the oil will lubricate the swivel. I've probably used mine 100 times over the years the swivel has never stopped again.I leave the entire thing together in the storage unfer the camper. you'll need a male to male hose adapter to hookthe washer hose to the hose nozzle found at any hardware store for a couple bucks. when you need to use it, simply turn off hot water heater, put the unit into te toilet, screw the one end of washer hose onto the sink and turn bot sides of faucet on, in two minutes or less you're cleaning your tank without pulling any dirty hoses in throughout trailer!\n\nI'd rated this a 5 if Camco could design the swivel to move up and down like a drive through car wash, apparently there is something stuck on my 1/3 mark? when i clean it it says empty yetwhen I just empty the tank it always reads 1/3 on my sensors panel. I suspect the water is just running over the sensor enough to make it say empty but not blasting whatever it is off? I'm now using the detegent dispensor from my power wsher with dish detergent hopefully, after a few uses it wll clean tha spot? will revise this review if it does? the spray foam does make it a bit heavier but it sure made it simple to use", "I had a lingering odor after emptying the black tank on my camper.

The glitter is pretty, but don't waste your time putting the \"garland\" string of beads on.

Quite a bit larger than the other trees (not Christmas themed) we have tried in the past. The package claims it will only last a couple day, but we had ours up about two months.

I mean, I can get 5 cancer sticks (aka regular tampons) at Cosco for the price of one of these. And that certainly adds up over time! But then again, so does the cost of harming the body with all those chemicals. Urggg.\n\nSo I finally decided that well-being was vastly more important than a few extra bucks each month and thus, made the switch these little bullet looking things, which I call 22\u2019s. Check out the pics and tell me it doesn\u2019t look like the bullet for a 22! I got the kind without the applicator, because it\u2019s less waste for the environment and (ok I admit it) mostly because it was cheaper.\n\nI was actually kind of freaking out about the no applicator thing (I mean how gross that I have to \u2026well, I\u2019ll leave out the details). Well, it hasn\u2019t been nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I mean, it took a few times for me to get used to it, but again, definitely not as bad as I thought it would be. Actually, I\u2019ve found that an AWESOME perk about the no applicator is that it\u2019s SO small and compact that it takes up virtually no room. Stick one or 2 in my pocket on a night out and I\u2019m good to go!\n\nLast thing to make note of... Again, it might be TMI but heck, what did you expect to get from a tampon review?! So before I had reformed my ways and was still buying cancer sticks, it would sometimes get itchy up there in lady world and would just feel \u2026hard to describe\u2026itchy/uncomfortable/not clean. Since I\u2019ve switched, that never happens anymore! Yay! I\u2019m pretty sure it was my ladyhood revolting at me in the presence of such unclean cancer sticks.\n\nI was NOT paid to do this review or given any free stuff. I did it because I\u2019m hoping that more ladies will make the switch. I know it\u2019s more expensive but your well-being is vastly more important than a few dollars. Trust me, I\u2019m an expert ;)\nAnyways, hope you enjoyed the review and that this helped. Please leave comments or questions if you have any and I\u2019d be SUPER appreciative if you\u2019d be so kind as to rate my review :D\n\nP.S. A few people commented about this being so hard to unwrap. They must have updated the product because it now has an easy peel flap in the middle. I took a pic so you can see what I mean.\nXoxo", "Organic cotton tampons are more expensive than rayon, but they're made with fewer chemicals and the fibers cause less trauma to the vaginal walls so I use them religiously. This one is a great product, easy to use and transport, and since I bought a case I won't need to buy tampons for over a year (FYI, I do the same with the Natracare breathable panty liners -- the only ones that don't leave me with a yeast infection since standard liners with plastic build up moisture).\n\nThe case is pretty compact, so storage isn't a problem and I get to enjoy both savings and convenience of not buying tampons monthly. Keep in mind these do not have an applicator, but I prefer this because they're more discreet (I can hide one in the palm of my hand or pants pocket) and also create less waste than the applicator versions.", "I love these. They are hard to find in stores, and more expensive there to boot.", "Love these things. Buying by the case, I can keep enough tampons everywhere and not worry about running out every time I get my period. And theyre organic so thats important to me. Maybe they could be more comfortable but they are perfect for me in every other way and periods just arent comfortable in general so the pros outweigh the cons", "I used O.B. before. Then suddenly that brand became unavailable EVERYWHERE. I hate plastic and applicators and all the waste. I hate the tampons that grow longer instead of wide.....Blah\n\nThese are comparable to O.B.. I did have a little less cramping...but not much. They are a bit more solid....almost to hard to absorb at first...I found that if I loosened it a bit by sticking my finger in the string end and scrunching it a bit, it made it a bit softer and more absorbent right away.\n\nHave switched to a cup now, but still carry these around for emergencies. Very nice product.", "I get these in bulk for my lady and it makes me a hero. Not only do I care about her body I also care it's as natural as she is.", "Item was damaged and received only one pack, not 12. I want my money back!", "These tampons are really good. It takes a little getting used to not having an applicator, but it's not a big deal.\nMy mind is at ease knowing the fibers are organically grown and do not contain harmful chemicals.\nThey can be a bit tricky to open at times, but mostly they are excellent. I also love the fact that buying them in a large quantity means I have plenty on hand and do not have to reorder frequently. Buying the case is definitely worth the investment and saves money.", "I was looking for an environmentally friendly choice that did not have either a plastic or cardboard applicator. From the reviews as well as the product description, this seemed like a great option. I would have given it a higher rating, however, I find that the outside wrapping, especially when I am in a rush, can be impossible to get off. Once they improve this aspect, I would increase my rating although I will still continue to purchase it. It is comfortable, just as good as the less environmentally friendly products, and a worthwhile choice.", "I used to be a die-hard OB user or nothing. These tampons changed my mind. They work better and make me feel better using an organic product instead of non-organic that is treated with pesticides. Would recommend!", "Can't believe it took me this long to find these! Only reason I rated them four instead of five stars is cost. Wish they were more affordable.", "My nether parts are much happier with these than with o.b., which has in recent years made some changes to their tampons. The past couple years using o.b. tampons, I've been having yeast infections after most periods, and tampon removal near the end of my periods has been painful. Since buying these tampons a few months ago, I'm not having these sorts of symptoms so far. Planning to try their pads now too.", "No pesticide sprayed cotton! ;) Treat yourself to cancer free coverage.", "ever since I read about cotton being made from the parts of the cotton plant too high in pesticides and chemicals to be feed to cattle, I use only organic cotton for personal items. These items are easy to use, easy to conceal, discreet and effective. I shared them with several friends who didn't know they weren't conventional and never noticed a difference in performance.", "Awesome Organic product without toxic chemicals", "Great product, I made the switch in June 2016 and will never go back.", "I like these tampons for their organic properties, but I just wish they would be easier to open!", "As tampons, these work fine, but it is incredibly difficult to open these. When I'm having to change these, I don't want to spend 5 minutes trying to get the seal open. I've had to resort to using scissors because the seal is ridiculously difficult. It's actually very frustrating and I can't wait to be done with this pack. This is the sort of thing you want to be able to do in and out super fast, but unfortunately not so.

It is not enjoyable to eat, but it does work well.", "I have been loosing 1 to 2 pounds a week using this product, I just don't eat anything after lunch and drink some of this at night when I'm feeling hungry. It fills me up and takes away any hunger pangs I may have had. Already lost 30 pounds fasting and using this product. It is working for me.", "This stuff works pretty good! Don't start with a whole scoop! Start with a quarter scoop. Work you're way up. I eat it on buttered Graham crackers. If you put it in liquid it turns to sludge. Oddly it has a slight cinnamon taste to it.", "I add Super Seeds to my smoothies for the extra fiber and claimed health benefits of the various ingredients, but I have no way to know if I'm healthier because of the Super Seeds, but I think that's true with most supplements.", "i like the taste of this, its easy to mix and use.", "I really enjoy this stuff and want to take a minute to share my experiences using this as a fiber supplement in case it's helpful to other people. I go to the gym in the mornings and also take medication that works best on an empty stomach. Working off of an empty stomach after hitting the gym can be difficult, so I have added this to my daily routine each morning. This stuff isn't for everyone, especially not for people who have issues with certain textures. It definitely clumps up a lot if you allow it to do so and there is nothing worse than getting a big clump of this stuff when trying to pound it down.\n\nTo avoid clumping I use a 32 ounce Nalgene with a lid and add about two inches of water. Then I take a full scoop of the powder and shake about a third of it into the container. If I see a big clump on the scoop while doing this, I break it up with my finger before pouring it in. After adding a third of the scoop I put the lid on the container and shake it well. Then I add another inch or so of water and half of the remaining scoop and repeat with adding water and shake. Do this one more time to finish the scoop of powder and fill the container to the top and shake vigorously. This is the only way I've found to avoid clumping. Adding one whole scoop at once always results in clumping. The clumps float to the top and can be broken apart with a fork but why deal with that when you can just avoid it all together. Please be aware that this supplement has actual chia seeds and various other seeds/sprouts in it that do not dissolve. This won't go away no matter how much you shake!\n\nThis process may seem like a pain but it only takes a minute and makes it a lot easier to guzzle it down. I know 32 ounces of water may seem like a lot for some people but you just have to get used to chugging it down. Don't let it sit too long because the chia seeds start absorbing water and become a little gelatinous. You should be drinking plenty of water if you want this stuff to work efficiently so this is a good way to get some of your water requirements (or goals) for the day out of the way. I try to get it all down within 10 minutes of making it. Then I'm set for the day!\n\nNot only does this do the job in the gut department, it also helps me feel full and gives me a boost of energy that gets me through until lunch time when I can eat something with some substance to it. It also feel like doing this allows my meds to kick in better. I take them about two hours before the fiber drink.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that this stuff doesn't work for them and my boyfriend tried it for a few months and also said that it didn't help him in the bathroom department, but that's because he wasn't drinking enough water throughout the day. He preferred to drink his mixed with a bit of water in a coffee mug and then didn't drink much water throughout the day. Using a small amount of water makes it incredibly sludgy and gross so I have no idea how he even stomached it. I'm not saying you have to drink a ton of water the second you take it if you prefer to use less, but if you do plan on using it be sure to drink lots of water consistently, even on days you aren't using it.", "hope it works.", "This is a great amount for the price. So a really good deal. There is no flavor so I put it in my oatmeal or smoothie in the mornings. It has worked great for me also. It does what I need it to.", "I purchased it to go in smoothies and save a fortune compared to what I spend at a well known smoothie shop", "Took about a week to truly start to work. Keeps me pretty full to where I can either skip a meal and or eat less. I have lost a bit of weight and I\u2019ve only been a few weeks on it. Great taste.", "Absolutely love the cinnamon taste of it!", "I blend a couple tablespoons of this with a little milk. It's healthy probiotic goodness with a lot of fiber and a fair amount of protein. I drink it right away after I blend it, otherwise after a few seconds it starts getting super think. Best to follow it with some water to aid digestion.", "I did not enjoy the flavor of this product. It's a bit fruity and I personally really taste the cinnamon. Just doesn't work for me.", "This is a good fiber but it's too messy and to dense. I found if i waited too long to drink it the mixture would clump", "Pleasant taste, but if you're looking for something that completely dissolves in liquid, look elsewhere.", "I'm trying to listen to my Dr. for a change and I decided to add more fiber to my diet. I wanted to add a supplement and I tried the orange flavored stuff. It was OK, but I wanted something that tasted more natural than like clumpy Tang with artificial sweetener.\n\nI purchased Garden of Life Super Seed based on the ingredients and good reviews and I am very happy with it. Not only am I getting fiber, I'm getting protein, Omega 3 and all the other good stuff it has. I was a little concerned because it had more calories and I'm overweight, but it is actually helping me lose weight by filling me up.\n\nI've also used it as a meal by mixing it with skim milk and eating it with 7-grain toast with marmalade or a couple of scrambled eggs. I love it mixed with milk. It goes down like a bran muffin in a drink. I also sometimes drink a glass with water 15 minutes before dinner and I noticed I'm able to control my portions much better.\n\nAnother reviewer said it is clumpy, and it is, especially if you wait. That is because fiber absorbs water so as time goes on it gets a little thick. The orange stuff works the same way, so either way you have to drink it quickly or maybe water it down a little and mix it up again (or just drink the thick remainder). OK, it doesn't taste like chocolate cake, but it isn't supposed to. I think this stuff tastes great, especially with milk.\n\nI find that out of the other high fiber foods I've tried (orange stuff, snack bars) this fills me up the best and I feel like my carb cravings have subsided a little.\n\nOver all, I feel my energy level has increased significantly and I have much less mental fog. This isn't due to this particular product per se, but it made it easier for me to increase fiber and lower simple carbs like white flour products and sweets. In addition to this supplement once or twice a day, which is more like a food than a supplement, I'm eating 1 high fiber snack bar a day and trying to eat veggies (I'm allergic to most fruits) at every meal for about 30g of fiber a day. I still eat my favorite bad food (pizza and Chinese food), but I am eating smaller portions-- and not because I'm forcing myself to eat small portions but because I'm full sooner.\n\nI feel great and I'm happy Super Seed is part of my daily diet.", "I am NOT a health nut. I am obese and I trying to get my health/weight/stress levels under control. I also do not have any digestive diseases, however I often suffered from significant discomfort from gas, bloating, constipation, and loose stools. These had been a recent onset in the last year or so, previous to that time, I had no GI upset.\n\nI (very reluctantly) decided that my first round of behavior modification would include getting my digestive system under control by trying to regulate my diet, adding a significant amount of fiber and protein. I was very wary of getting a fiber powder because I don't like gritty textures and don't tolerate \"healthy\" tasting items well either. So I tried this in conjunction with a well-reviewed probiotic.\n\nI cannot express to you how impressed I was with this stuff. It mixes fairly easily (only spoon requires), has TONS of really good stuff for you, and doesn't taste terribly bad. However, here are a few tips:\n\nIf you do not like apples AND cinnamon, you will not like this.\nI find it absolutely disgusting when mixed with just water. It tastes to me like I imagine eating water-y mud would taste like (I literally gagged). However, I can use as little as 4 oz of fruit juice and 8 oz of water and be totally happy with the taste.\nIt tastes fake and almost sour if you mix it with apple juice. Orange, mango, and some combination of peach work wonderfully.\nThat being said, I also highly recommend mixing it with 12 oz or more of liquid if your like me and don't like to drink your apple sauce.\nHIGHLY recommend mixing with ice. Even if it sits out in my hand for a couple of minutes, the combination of thick and luke warm makes me gag.\nTends to settle very quickly, so always stir before you drink (especially important if you do water/juice combo instead of all juice. For whatever reason tends to pull just water to top, cause the water/fiber mixture to gag me). Also, tends to get slimier as well when let to sit more than a minute (also something I have trouble with).\nTo get total relief of my GI symptoms, I have to use twice daily.\n\nDouble BONUS POINTS: It works as a superb appetite suppressant. You really will maintain AT LEAST 4 hours without tummy growling hunger.\n\nAfter some experimentation, I can't live without it. Completely made me a believer!", "I purchased this because it was advertised as being good for diverticulosis. I like the fact that it takes natural food ingredients to add fiber to your diet. I mix it with a little water and it tastes pretty good. It is sweet and fruity. The important thing to remember with this is that it is powerful and you have to know just the right dose for YOU. If you just jump in and start taking it, it will deliver a nightmare from which you won't want to take it again. LOL The instructions should be rewritten to start with a very small amount, like 1 teaspoon or 1/2 teaspoon. Then increase it until you achieve the results you're after. How much fiber supplement you need really depends on how much fiber you have already eaten in your meal. Take this supplement along with your meal. I take it no later than 5 p.m. with my dinner and allow it to work its magic overnight. Flax seed is known to cause diarrhea if you're not used to taking it or other strong fiber supplements.

It's perfect for two people sitting on chaise lounge chairs. That said, there is an issue. The first time I used it, it worked great. Both nozzles put out a nice mist just the right amount. Second time I used it, one of the nozzles would not work at all. I live in an area that has hard water so I'm not that surprised that this happened, especially when you think about how super tiny the orifice is on the mist nozzles. I did find a way to make the nozzle work again. I took a shot glass and put about 1/3 of a shot of vinegar in the glass. Then I put the nozzle part into the shot glass making sure the vinegar just covered the nozzles and not go above the end cap. I didn't want the vinegar to possibly effect the glue holding on the cap. I left it overnight and the next day it worked just like the first time. I really like this product, I just hope I don't have to do this every time I used it.", "I hung this is a tree and the hummingbirds loved it.

It only mist on one side the other side sprays out it doesn't mist like the other side does. Not to please with it.\nNot sturdy or strong.\nDoesn't work well!\nIt's easy to use just connect to your hose and turn the hose on.\nGood Luck if you get both misters to work.", "In my quest to get a summer tan and not burn up in the process, I purchased this misting system. I'm very pleased with it. I tan on my deck, which tends to get very hot with not much wind. This product arrived in an extremely large box but it was packaged well and arrived undamaged. Setup was very easy and the product performs as it is supposed to. A fine, cool, mist is sprayed from each side of the end and it really does make the area surrounding it cooler. My only complaint is that this thing does not stand up straight. It leans over rather significantly, but it still works!\n\nI would definitely recommend to anyone looking for an easy way to stay cool this summer.", "One of my friends had one of these and I loved it! She would hook it up while our kids were playing outside on a hot day and she and I would sit comfortably and watch. She would put a box fan behind it when she had parties and everyone on the patio could enjoy a cooling mist. I decided I had to have one, but couldn't find it at any of our local hardware stores. So I came to Amazon, and here it is!\n\nThe downside is that you don't get to pick your color. However, they picked perfectly for me and sent me one that matches the shutters on my house, so I can't really complain! It works very well, is easy to set up, and does just want I want. Putting a box fan behind it ensures that it blows on the right direction instead of relying on the wind. For the price, this item can't be beat!", "A friend of mine was looking for a misting system to leave in her backyard for her outdoor pets during the hot days in Los Angeles. We found this Orbit misting system and figured we would give it a try. It works well and undoubtedly mists the area to keep it cooler. It's a good product for the price. Some of the other misters are very expensive and take some time to install; therefore, if you are looking for a quick, inexpensive mister that works, then I would recommend this product. The only down side is the fact that you cannot pick the color of your choosing, you basically get whatever is sent.", "Granted, you can't compare this mister to those that are more robust and complicated, but for what it is you can't go wrong. We live in the Sacramento region that has very dry, hot summers. We wanted to get a cheap mister that all we had to do is plug the garden hose into... and the fact that this is a free-standing mister (no installation required) sealed the deal.\n\nRight next to the mister (within about 2-3 feet) it is a wet mist that will leave you feeling a little damp (but cool and comfortable). However, just a little further away you get the cooling without much dampness. The less wind, the better it seems to cool, but a slight breeze doesn't render it useless. It is extremely convenient in that it is reasonably portable.\n\nAn unintended benefit of this mister is that the infant/toddlers that frequented our back yard last summer loved playing with the mister... putting their finger over the nozzle, letting it spray in their faces, etc. It was one of the biggest hits in the back yard for play and for staying cool. It has easily held up to the abuse as well!", "It didn\u2019t come with a washer so water would leak everywhere. We used a washer from an old sprinkler that we had and it worked fine. Great for the garden or to cool off a bit on a hot summer day.", "We use this mister (there are only two little metal mister nozzles at the top) for keeping the pets cool in the heatwave months. The summers get very hot and dry and our three pets hang around the cool water spray most of the day. The water hose can be turned on with just a little pressure and works all day long to provide a fine mist from the top. The wild birds flock to get drinks of water from the mist that falls on the grass. The mister we received was purple and the base is a bit wobbly so we have to use something to prop it on one end to keep from tipping; but there haven't been any issues yet from it falling over. The wobbling is the only issue keeping this at 4 stars instead of 5.", "Living in the South, this mister provides relief when working outside in the yard or just sitting outside reading in the summer. Unlike other misters I have tried, this one doesn't leak when you put it on the hose. Some of these products have a tendency to not be able to thread with your hose sufficiently, thus having leaks and wasting precious water. This provides an even light misting to cool you off without getting soaked. The best part is since the pressure on this is so even, once you turn off your hose, it still provides a mist for about 20-30 minutes later.", "Should keep our patio area a little cooler, but I mostly bought it for the hummingbirds I feed. Hopefully they like it. It was missing the washer, which is the first thing the directions ask you to look for. Not hard to fix, just run to the hardware store and pick up some hose washers, but still annoying. That's why I'm taking off one star. Oh, Just a heads up, it comes in a giant box since this product isn't flexible.", "Works great and easy to set up. I had a MistyMate 10 which has 6 (plastic) misters you screw into 10' of small tubing, right out of the box half of the misters were broken. Not wanting to deal with buying new misting heads, I decided to give this a try. This thing is awesome ! Easy to set up and it doesn't use a lot of water. The best part is, its so portable to move it around where ever you need it. My wife uses it when she sunbathes and when she is thru with it, I move it over to the dog kennel. We have used it all day, everyday for weeks and only once has one of the \"brass\" nozzles clogged up but, a small peice of wire cleared it. I also bought some Gilmore Metal Hose Coupling Filter Washers which helps to filter out any larger size debris.", "I bought this for my daughters birthday party. It was supposed to be over 90 degrees and we had a bounce house so I was afraid the little kids would be over heated. We put this at the end part of the slide so the kids could go through it. Definately was a good idea for us! The kids even fought over it at times and it held up fine (didn't fall apart or anything) . Very light and portable. We put a brick on it to keep it stablized but it wasn't necessary. The kids ended up moving the brick and carrying it all over the place anyways. (or as long as the hose could go) I don't know, long term, the durablity of it since I only used it once so far, but it seems that it would last for a while.", "This works pretty well although I have only tested it a couple times because it's not quite warm enough to use it regularly yet. I purchased this to place near my chicken's run to help cool them off during the hot summer months. The only negative thing I will say so far is that it is slightly bent which causes it so fall over- which is annoying. I have to lean it against something to keep it upright. I will update this post in July or August when it's used regularly.", "This is EXACTLY what we needed. We didn't want to pay a ton of money for an overhead sprinkler system and then we saw these. We are in hot hot south texas weather and we have chickens that need to stay cool. I bought two of these and set them about 25 foot apart in the chicken yard. They hooked up nicely, did not leak, good material, and the mist is so thin it did not even get the coop wet that was only 5 foot away. There was an obvious drop in temperature right away. My chickens come out during the day now instead of staying hidden until evening when the temperature goes down. They are enjoying their yard again and I am enjoying my hens again. THANK YOU! Could not believe how inexpensive such an effective product could be!", "Very surprised by this. It is not going to cover a large space or anything like that but if you are sun bathing or sitting outside this is fantastic. Well worth the money. My toddler thinks it's amusing to put his hand in the mist and get wet. So it is safe around kids. Worst thing they can do is knock it over. It's quite steady by itself due to the design", "OG Floridian here, and I seriously can not take the summer heat without this. I just bring it around with me as I garden, or right next to my chair when I'm laying out. Perfection!", "The misting stand is overall a nice item, and it cools off the area, but it continuously falls over and has to be picked up. I have 3 others that are made with bendable material and these don't have a problem, so I think it is just the fact that it is not stable on a surface that is not flat. So if you are purchasing for a flat surface and not a uneven lawn then this would be a great purchase. Also the other thing I noticed different about this one compared to the other Orbit Misting Stands I have is that the misting holes were on the top and the others that I have are on the nose.", "This summer has been brutally hot on the western shores of Lake Michigan where I slip my sailboat. On a particularly muggy Saturday a few weeks ago I ventured over to a little gathering of my dockmates who happened to have a couple of these set up to cool off the guests. It took me about 5 minutes to log onto Amazon.com and get one of these bad boys on the way! As is often the case, my sailing days since have been spent in the mid-70's so I haven't had a chance to break mine out yet but, given my initial experience with the mister, I'm looking forward to comfortable cocktail hours from here on in! The misting jets are adjustable from a fine vapor up to a pretty good spray. Another one of those million dollar ideas that I wish I had! Fantastic product at a more than reasonable price!", "I have owned a mister like this before years ago. I have been looking for one like I had before. It is easy to attach to the water hose and mists well. I bought this two fold. The heat where I live has been almost unbearable. I actually bought two. I use it for my plants which does not seem to get enough water. It is also great when outside and I need a little water misting on myself."]}]}
