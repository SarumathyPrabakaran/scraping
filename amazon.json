    "description": "Gillette Mach3 men\u2019s razor blade refills feature stronger-than-steel blades that stay sharper longer (vs. Sensor3). With sharper blades (first 2 blades vs. Sensor3), it is engineered to last for 15 comfortable shaves. These Gillette razors feature a lubrication strip that glides to help protect your skin from redness, and a microfin skin guard that stretches the skin, and prepares hair to be cut. Mach3 men's razor blade refills fit all Mach3 razors.",

        "I've got a couple of razors which I can use to shave my face with. The Mach 3 provides a clean shave with very few nicks or none at all. In other words, it is comfortable and effective shaving system.",
        "These razors are great for sensitive skin and can be used more than one time! It's great value for your money! Will continue to purchase! The cost is much cheaper than big chain stores",
        "Like most razor blades, the cost is high. But I can get probably 5 to 6 shaves per blade. I still have the original handle and it works like a new one. Can recommend this product \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb",
        "Re: Headline..I recently did my own razor rating test using the Mach 3, Harry\u2019s and DSC, four blade razor. Mach 3 far the best. 1. More shaves per cartridge by far +15. -Harry\u2019s razor about 6 to 8 , varied per cartridge . DSC - 5-6. Note: I am an ex-barber, retired and have an average beard.\nMach 3 had the least skin irritation and seldom nicked the skin and was easy to use under the nose and around the chin. Harry\u2019s a bit bulky under the nose/ upper lip, but it has a trimmer edge on reverse to make up for it, and it is feels great on the face. DSC- left most nicks and irritation.\nMach 3 handle ok, But Harry\u2019s felt weighty and comfortable to use, the best of all the handles. DSC razor handle felt cheap.\nSo the Gillette, though pricey , was the Best Buy IMO. But Harry\u2019s a close rival- a refill pack $2-$3\nless expensive per pack ( depending where bought vis a vis Gillette) ,though a bit more more per shave. Only a matter of cents so I still have Harry\u2019s razor handle , and may give it a another try.\nYou wanted an honest review and here it is.",
        "I had a membership to one of those shave clubs. The price was ok but the quality of the blades were not great. These Gillette blades, when bought on Amazon, are a MUCH better value. The blades are sharp and last forever. I shave every other day and I can get a couple of months out of one blade.",
        "No kidding ladies they work so much better on the legs and underarms than women's razors. We save money because me and my husband use the same type of razor.",
        "I've been shaving for 55 years, and these are the best razor blades ever.\nEasy to use, super close shave, just about impossible to cut yourself with.\nGood for sensitive skin.",
        "I Love these.. use them all the time-- NOW don't have to wait around for an attendant to come unlock the cabinet to get them.. and then wait around again to get through a ridiculous line!!!",
        "Shaving bald head",
        "Es un producto original as\u00ed que no tienes ning\u00fan problema con \u00e9l",
        "Great",
        "had used only one time and it did the job !",
        "Buenos repuestos de Gillette mach 3",
        "Just as good as the store bought blades. Work fantastic for me and my sensitive face. Will buy again.",
        "Im thought that in use do not need shaving foam but unfortunately without this blades not for sensitive skin, blades clog up quickly and i often clean up with toothpick or toothpaste tip",
        "Good blades",
        "These razors work well but are overpriced. I cut with any other razors so I've used these for years. I do wish they were less expensive and I hoped all the recent competition would drive down the price, but that hasn't happened yet. If you have to have these this is a good deal here from Amazon.",
        "These are perfect for both my husband and for me (the wife). I have two razors and saves time and money to buy these for us both. :)",
        "These Mach3 cartridges provide a good shaving experience and an excellent value for the money.",
        "N/a"
