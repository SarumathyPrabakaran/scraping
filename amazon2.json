I felt when using the DayQuil I felt better for maybe an hour and then was back to square one, and you're only allowed one dose every 6 hours so I was miserable for the next 5 hours until I could take another dose. The NyQuil was very helpful though, after taking it I was asleep in less than 30 minutes and that was with a half dose and would sleep throughout the night with no problem, whereas without it I'd wake up every hour because of my congestion.

Buy the 44186 version. I actually bought that one first for one of our offices, and tried it out before buying another. However, instead of just going going back to my order history and re-ordering - I did a search and came up with this one under Prime and thought it was the same. It's miles from the same. This one feels a lot cheaper in it's construction. But the biggest difference? The large back is held to the seat part by the armrests only! Yes, you heard correctly, by the armrests. The 44186 model connects to the seat itself... so much better engineering. The small part- \"back in motion\" piece has an L shape connector to the seat. The then seat has an L shape connector to the backrest. On top of that, the reason I liked the chair was it's ability to keep pressure on my lower back. I'm not sure if this is also a difference- actually think it's broken... but I can't \"lock\" the seat from leaning forward like a rocking chair. The other one definitely locks.

I rub it around with the tip of the syringe, a little goes a long way. If you use too much, the gel will gush out when putting in your trays. if the gel gets on your gums wipe it off! it will cause gum sensitivity. I set a timer for 30 minutes and repeat every couple days (unless teeth are sensitive) until reaching the desired brightness of white. It only takes freshening up twice a year for me. And I drink coffee and tea daily. I'm sure everyone is different.

But it would be nicer if these included mold able teeth trays. I had to buy those separate.\n\nOne thing I wish I would\u2019ve looked into more is how long you\u2019re supposed to wear these. For the 20% (what I bought) it suggests 2-4 hours for a single application! I suffer from fairly bad dry mouth, so 2 hours is the max I can go before I have to drink something. Also, I don\u2019t exactly have 2-4 hours of my day that I can give to these for multiple days in a row. I am busy like many other people are. Honestly I wouldn\u2019t have bought these if I knew that.\n\nI personally recommend this brand, but instead of these I recommend the prefilled trays that are offered.

The sensitivity last only a few days and it will be gone.\nSome other people mentioned it, but you buy cheap painting brushes with narrow brush from Walmart or craft store, or even cheap eyeliner brush from Target.

Also, you can't squeeze the damn connectors together with your fingers! You'll need a \"robo-grip\" or other flat jaw pliers to close them up. This lamp also works very well on a dimmer. I would have given it five stars, except it has an interesting \"bug\" that (depending on how your \"original\" can was installed in the ceiling) will prevent you from focusing the lamp on the place you want. The lamp has a wide \"adjustment\" range, but ... at the \"ends\" of its range it \"stops\". So, when the \"clips\" are in a certain position (which is what happened to me), you simply cannot move the lamp to that point. Perhaps the engineers at Lithonia could develop a second set of \"clip holders\" for the wire clips that would allow the clips to be re positioned by 90 degrees, which would handily solve that (minor) problem. All in all, this is a well-built lamp and the color rendering and uniformity are excellent. One last tip. Amazon will ship this unit to you in it's manufacturers retail box ... unless you check the feature \"ship in Amazon box\".

I think it\u2019s a good, clean one.", "I purchased spearmint, because it doesn't have Xylitol - which we didn't want in our toothpaste. I believe that some of the other flavors do have Xylitol. This toothpaste is different from any I've used before, and quite frankly took some getting used to. It doesn't lather, bubble, or taste overly sweet. As a result, it seemed bland & boring when I first started using it. After about a week of using it, I grabbed my old toothpaste & decided to brush with it, because I thought I missed that minty freshness - I about gagged. My old toothpaste was too sweet, made my mouth water, and just felt like I was brushing my teeth with melted candy. I went back to the Redmond & realized that without the sugar substitute (Xylitol), mint just tastes like mint. I realized that my mouth felt cleaner after using it than when I used my old name brand toothpaste - I just hadn't realized it, because I was so used to that overwhelming sweet minty taste being in my mouth long after I was done brushing. Redmond just leaves my teeth & mouth clean - that's what it does. Now, I've grown accustomed to just being clean. My mouth feels clean after brushing like my body feels it's cleanest after a shower (before you put on the sticky deoderant & the perfumes & the make-up). Just clean. I like it. Another benefit of Redmond's, (@ least the flavor I got), is that because after rinsing, I don't have a film on my tongue or the taste of toothpaste in my mouth - anything that I eat or drink after brushing tastes like it's supposed to. For example, a lemonade tastes like lemonade - my old toothpaste would make the lemonade taste sour. So, no I don't miss the overly sweet toothpaste I used to use, because this one leaves my mouth truly clean and allows me to have properly operating taste buds when I'm finished. It does take some getting used to, though.\n\nUpdate: I ordered another tube of this, because I like it & because my last dental check-up ended up better than expected. We lost our dental insurance when my husband lost his job. New job & now we have insurance, but it had been nearly a year since I'd went to the dentist & during that time I got a discoloration that I was convinced was a cavity (no pain, though). So, when I went to the dentist, he said it's a pit in an old filling that has started to break down - & it got a stain in the pit. It's not a cavity, but he doesn't know how I could NOT have a cavity there since the pit exposed a part of the tooth. So, the bad news is that now I have an appointment to get the filling replaced, but the good news is... no cavities. When my husband found out, he decided to try switching to Redmond. He has very sensitive teeth and uses a special toothpaste that was helping some, but he still had problems with sensitivity. So, he'd been reluctant to switch. I suggested he brush with his old toothpaste in the a.m. and Redmond's in the pm to help with the transition, but he ignored me - he was prepared to 'tough it out'. He started using Redmond for all brushing & at first was surprised that his sensitivity stayed the same for the first week - it did not get worse as we'd expected. After the first week, he noticed LESS sensitivity. This toothpaste is doing more than his special one was. As for taste, he says that nothing tastes as bad as his old brand, which was like brushing his teeth with cough syrup, so he doesn't mind the Redmond at all. He can now drink coffee while it's still hot. Maybe not a big deal to most of you, but for those of you with sensitivity issues, you'll appreciate that that is a big deal. He hasn't tried ice cream yet, but he's convinced it won't be a problem. He says his mouth hasn't been so pain-free since he was a kid. I don't know why this toothpaste helped his sensitivity, but he's sure getting more enjoyment out of eating, now that he's not having trouble with sensitive teeth and gums. Hope he doesn't end up gaining back the weight he worked so hard to lose :-)", "We love this toothpaste especially now with the added nano silver. Our dental hygienist loves it too as we have very little plaque or tartar build up on our teeth at our 6 month cleanings! Great product, highly recommend", "I bought this for my daughter to use but she does not like it at all - not the flavor or the color. It's a good product though in terms of being natural and effective.", "Love the lemon flavor but this 6 pack was only a 6 pack of toothpaste BOXES with 5 TUBES. Check your set! I would send it back but I am out & need to use it now. The price is still somewhat reasonable.", "I went in search of a clay based toothpaste for remineralization purposes after a trip to the dentist revealed I had a bunch of small cavities and doing some research on the Internet to possibly avoid further damage/avoid some fillings. So I purchased this with come coconut oil for oil pulling after brushing (I plan on using it like a mouthwash). I was expecting this toothpaste to be super gross and gritty and I was pleasantly surprised! It does smell gently of lemon, though taste wise I didn't really notice lemon, or any other flavor really. I am pretty sensitive to taste and texture (certain foods will make me gag even if it tastes really good with the wrong texture) and I didn't have any problems at all! I love the way it smells and my teeth feel really clean. My teeth are nice and smooth and not slippery like with your traditional fluoride toothpaste. I equate it to the clean feeling like after you've been to the dentist. I also use a Braun electric toothbrush so that may help contribute to that. I especially love that there is NO gross aftertaste like I get with any kind of standard toothpaste (I also particularly hate just about every variation of mint so I had to settle with pronamel gentle whitening) or gross taste altering so yes you can have your orange juice after brushing. It does seem to \"dissolve\" after you start brushing but I don't feel that it doesn't mean it's not cleaning my teeth effectively. I do notice a very fine grit in the toothpaste if I grind my teeth together but it's not enough to bother me. I did pause a little at the lead warning but I did look it up and here is what their webpage says:\n\nProp 65 lists of over 900 substances, including lead, that businesses are required to warn consumers about. Lead is a natural element in soil, so it can be found in trace amounts in anything that is grown or drawn from the earth \u2014 including fruits, vegetables, and, of course, Earthpaste.\n\nSince our bodies can\u2019t absorb naturally occurring lead in many natural products, like Bentonite clay, proposition 65 allows exemptions for natural products like mixed nuts and brussels sprouts that would otherwise have to claim lead levels many times more than the limit imposed by the legislation. We believe Earthpaste falls under the exempted products definition, but we\u2019re pretty cautious around here, and not terribly interested in defending civil action by prop 65 watchdogs hoping for a settlement or share of daily fines. So we updated our packaging to avoid the kind of mess that would be hard for a company our size to weather.\n\nAnd if that doesn't convince you, know that it's not by some process that the lead ends up in the toothpaste, it is naturally occurring in bentonite clay! As for the reviewer that said to do your research (citing an article where the writer also says you won't find lead in fruit because the fruit doesn't touch the soil) doesn't know that lead in water is incredibly dangerous because it is unbound lead! It binds to your body where it causes problems by lingering and building up. Yes the clay is found deep down in the earth so it will contain trace amounts of other minerals including lead. Here is a little of the science behind why bentonite binds lead as well as other toxins:\n\nWhile bentonite clay does contain small amounts of lead, it\u2019s thankfully not bioavailable to the body\u2026 meaning that the lead doesn\u2019t leach out of the clay and into the body. It\u2019s already bound by the clay and held there.\n\nBentonite clay has a negative electrical charge and is searching for things that have a positive charge\u2026 like lead. So even though it contains trace amounts of lead, it\u2019s holding on tight to the lead, not letting it go in your or your child\u2019s body.\n\nI hate to see people jumping to criticize companies that are trying to be responsible without knowing the background behind the warnings. I am an engineer for a company that manufactures the instruments that labs use to see how much of any element is in a sample. This includes wastewater testing for mine sites as well as companies that manufacture electronics and test lead paint against state standards. The standards by which the test the water is more lenient than anything earthpaste has to contend with so trust that it's an insignificant amount you could potentially be ingesting (that you will pass anyways). Lead is everywhere, and getting it from this toothpaste is one product you don't have to worry about.\n\n[...]\n[...]", "Does not cause kankersores. No SLS!

While using xylitol the past 1+ years i had no issues with my teeth, no cavities, no staining etc so i felt compelled to tell others about the fact that fluoride isnt exactly all its made out to be. While i was on amazon shopping for natural tooth paste i purchased xylitol and i also purchased this toothpaste so i can do a side by side review. In the beginning i honestly wasn't use to this toothpaste because it was brown instead of white and it didnt foam in my mouth which made me question and get concerned that it wasnt going to clean my teeth properly. Out of fear i decided to use Earthpaste for only a few weeks before going to xylitol and in the beginning i really thought i was making the right decision. (fyi During the weeks i used earthpaste i never had any issues with my teeth.) I also never threw away my EarthPaste and it was just sitting on the shelf for a few months, i thought when i ran out of xylitol i would just use this. After i did some more research on xylitol i realized that i did make a mistake...although it was still much healthier then any of the other branded toothpastes you will find in your supermarket, it was still concerning to find some chemicals in there that were not natural. So i came back on Amazon and started looking again until i came to this page...i realized that this toothpaste is so much healthier and better for you then any other one just based on the fact that it only uses natural ingredients! This was a shock to me, it was SLS free, Fluoride free, and had no harsh chemicals or scents or whatever else the other brands add to their tooth paste.\n\nNow granted many people will order this, take a glance at the color and the feel of the paste and wonder if they made the right decision. I did the same thing. Just because something foams or looks more like the average toothpaste doesnt mean it is healthy for you. I brushed my teeth with xylitol, ate some food and then came back to brush my teeth with Earthpaste....the difference is noticeable, not just in the look of them, but in the way they clean. Earthpaste cleans better then the other brand and i can actually feel the difference on my teeth. I am going to find the subscribe button so i can have this delivered to me every other month. Earthpaste, you have a customer for life. Thank you for the great product and if i may suggest, next product you come out with should be completely/or partly organic, which i believe would get the attention of more customers! :)\n\ni will be back in a few months and update everyone with how its going with this toothpaste!", "Good natural toothpaste.", "Wish it wasn\u2019t so expensive!", "I absolutely love this toothpaste, my teeth feel so clean after using it and the cinnamon flavor is delicious (and cinnamon, even just the flavor of it without swallowing, activates hormones in the body that help with insulin sensitivity and blood sugar regulation, so added health bonus!). So happy to have such a minimalist and simple product that is so micronutrient and mineral dense and has done wonders to remineralize my teeth to proper thickness and turn my gums from a painful sensitive red to a healthy pink and much stronger.\n\nI\u2019d also like to address another concern that was brought up: trace amounts of lead naturally present in bentonite clay, that automatically requires the prop 65 label just for being there at all, but not because it exceeds the limit of legal to sell and safe\u2014 it\u2019s a very trace amount.\n\nBentonite Clay contains less lead than many common foods like vegetables and nuts, and if you live in a major city your drinking water probably contains more lead. Even common collard greens contain over 5 times the amount of lead as bentonite clay, and it is considered safe to eat, even under prop 65. Many women use bentonite clay regularly for facial masks for decades and never get cancer or lead poisoning.\n\nFluoride on the other hand is extremely over-abundant in our municipal water systems and is way too abundant in most dental hygiene products like mouthwash and toothpaste, and fluoride is creating a real problem of wearing down and thinning the bones as well as causing liver damage, even in children. We need to be using alternatives to this, and aside from a good household water filter system, a good fluoride-free toothpaste is super important to protect your health. The simple fact of the matter is fluoride is much more abundant in most products and water than lead is in this one. If there were too much lead in bentonite clay, you\u2019d get sick pretty quickly since you\u2019re putting it in your mouth\u2014 I have a pretty sensitive body, and even I haven\u2019t had any issues with bentonite clay over the years.", "I like this toothpaste as it doesn\u2019t burn my gums.

Like a bottle of milky water with chalk condiments at the bottom. I shook it vigorously like it said and also mixed half and half with water in my bathroom cup as suggested. At first taste it was like clove and a weirdness mixture. It smelled like essential oils lol. The entire first impression was one of WHAT THE HECK ISSSS THIS! Lolol. BUTTTTT- then, the magic started. My mouth quickly adapted to the taste and started to tingle ever so slightly. I gargled once then spit. Then I gargled again and swished and made sure it covered every tooth and gargled my throat. You need a very small amount. Its very strong even mixed with water. Youll waste it if you dump to much. Like a half of a regular mouthwash cap is enough. When i was done my mouth felt alive. Like so clean and oddly fresh but not like stinging mouthwash. It was a tender yet powerful medicinal fresh. My tongue didnt burn like with alot of mouthwashes I tried. But my teeth were seriously loving the feeling. I had used some charcoal whitening powder last year not knowing it ate enamel and ended up with damage to some teeth sadly. Ive been doing remineralizing treatments at home but the damage is already done. Not to bad but I see it everyday in the mirror. So I needed something to combat the acid in my mouth and help with a few sensitive areas and with a tad of the ingredients this offers as per my dentists suggestion, I found it! Ive been using pro enamel toothpaste to help. Over the course of the first day, my mouth felt so great! Fresh breath but a coating of oddness was on my teeth that made them feel soft in the areas that were rough due to the enamel erosion in spots. The sensitivity to cold drinks seemed less but I wanted to give it a few days to truly grip the products experience. Ive used this about 8 times now. Each time shaking it up hard and mixing half and half as suggested for the first week. But I love it so much I changed to full strength this morning! Wowww. Triple the affects. Lol.

My mouth is left fresh and tingly for Hours. As the hours go on, it starts to settle down but then I miss it. Its almost like having a mint in your mouth for hours. I love it. My teeth are always shiny and so smooth after I use it. Its settled my mouth down like night and day. My sensitivity to things is virtually gone. I dont know how the combination of ingredients work for me exactly but they just do! Its a fun and invigorating mouth adventure. It will take a bit to get used to it, but if you give it a few days- youll understand its magic. Your mouth is coated and feels so great. Your teeth become smooth and fresh. It seeps down into every crack and just soothes everything inc the gums. I cant even find the words to properly describe this potion but I truly love it in every single way.

I wanted a fluoride-free, natural toothpaste and stronger, whiter teeth. After 4 weeks, my teeth are visibly whiter and also have a shine. My husband said he noticed a difference after just over a week (but I have also schooled him about being supportive to the point I take that with a grain of salt).

I first tried the trio a year ago and I didn't last long. The taste is something you get used to after a few uses, but it's also a matter of establishing routine because it takes a bit of time to have multiple steps. I do have to take breaks during \"swishing\" sessions to make sure I don't accidentally swallow, but this also gets better with time.\n\nMy routine: At night, I floss, brush with the toothpaste and swish the remineralization liquid for 5 minutes or more - the key is to find something productive to do that takes your mind off the time, like folding laundry or loading the dishwasher.

Mornings, I brush, swish with the remineralization liquid while I shower, swish with the mouthwash while I do my face cleansing routine (aim for 10 minutes), then swish with the Crest 3D while I finish getting ready for work (aim for 10 minutes). This way, I'm not adding any time to my normal routine and it's anchored to things I always do so I don't forget.

I feel compelled to leave a review about this mouth wash! A little back story; I started using listerine mouth wash with alcohol included twice daily, each use caused pain and discomfort. It burned my mouth so much. On the 3rd day I couldn't even hold it in my mouth for more than 10 seconds! The burning on my tongue was so bad I couldn't stand it, it had my eyes watering! I felt surely this can't be freaking normal? I start asking friends and family and while some agreed it burns they said it shouldn't be burning that bad? I was noticing about 30 mins after using it I would end up with this stringy gooey white stuff in my mouth! I started googling and apparently the listerine is so harsh it is burning the tissue in my mouth and the white stuff is dead tissue clumping up in my mouth!! Freaking blew my mind that this crap is recommended to be used at all, let alone twice daily?! It was destroying my mouth! My tongue started having a permanent\nburnt sensation as if I had eaten something too hot! My mouth was now overly dry all the time! My cousin recommended this uncle Harry's natural mouth wash and it arrived today, I just tried it, and oh my goodness! I was bracing for the worst, expecting a terrible taste and incredible discomfort annnnnd... WOW, WAS THAT IT?! The taste was not unbearable at all, I did dilute with water like my cousin recommended I also see it says to on on bottle. It did not burn my mouth AT ALL. I had no challenge keeping it and swishing it in my mouth for as long as I saw fit. And 20 mins after I have plenty of saliva and a nice subtle minty fresh sensation in my mouth! I absolutely love this mouthwash!", "Uncle Harry's Mouthwash is highly concentrated and highly effective mouthwash for maintaining oral hygiene. A little goes a long way.", "Excellent gargle, clears mucus, very refreshing", "I love this stuff! It makes my mouth feel so clean all day! \ud83d\ude03 I actually don\u2019t even remember the last time I had morning breath! \ud83e\udee2\ud83e\udd14 Even my last dentist asked me what I was using because there was a noticeable improvement with my oral health. I think it works wayyyyy better than the other toothpaste brands as far as fighting cavities and whitening teeth. I very highly recommend! \ud83d\ude01", "The flavor is intense and it definitely made me lose taste with repeated use so I had to stop. Eliminated my bad breath though, taste okay, and leaves the mouth feeling really refreshed!", "I was thrown a bit after receiving my order with an entirely different logo, thinking it was a knock off. After contacting the company directly, I was told that this is their new design. Nothing makes my mouth feel fresher, and my sensitive gums have completely healed. Highly recommend!", "Absolutely amazing. I haven't been to a dentist in just over 5 years now. I floss and brush twice a day. I am always getting compliments on my smile. Originally I stopped using fluoride based stuff and decided to make my own toothpaste with coconut oil and baking soda etc DIY. Anyways I then moved to JasOn products which weren't \"bad\" but it containts large amounts of the Phosophate 20 or whatever its called that is used in soap products etc....so I stopped using their mouthwash, I do use their toothpaste with no SLS an fluoride in conjunction with Dr Harrys spearmint so a duality and I love it....\n\nI have been using the mouthwash for maybe two weeks now. It is VERY strong! I notice a strong burn sensation and it didn't burn in a hurtful painful way but rather a CLEAN way...it burned so good I literally LOST my taste buds! I couldn't taste my food or anything this stuff is strong! TO be fair I did try this diet pill the same day I tried the mouthwash and you know you shouldnt try TWO new products on the same day. Nonetheless the pill went back since I just wanted to drop 13lbs sooner than later. I use the mouthwash however a LITTLE goes a LONG way....and I dilute with water no specific exact measurements just pour and add then swish around STILL burns but not as much my mouth feels AMAZING! Like OMG this stuff is wonderful...my teeth feel \"different they feel more \"fuller\" idk how to explain but after one use when you smell your breath alluding from your mouth you too will see how AMAZING this product is.....", "I love this product been using it for more than 3 yrs. But the label change had me puzzled. There are different phone numbers as well. I would like confirmation on the label change before I use the product.", "I never thought my mouth could feel so clean! This is an incredibly powerful mouthwash made up of truly impressive and of course natural ingredients. I am always astonished at how fresh and just GOOD my mouth feels after using it. I mean bad breath is non-existent after using this, no question. But it actually has a long lasting effect. Something about alkaline Ph and saliva, a balance, it seems to act as a shield for your mouth all day. I would definitely say trying this for the first time is quite a transition. You must get used to this stuff. It may even be a rough transition because of how bad it burns at first. But I give my word that once you're used to it, you will have a confidence in your oral health like never before. I use uncle Harry's brushing soap in tandem with this mouthwash. I'd recommend that as well for the maximum effect. Also, if you're going to try this stuff out, I HIGHLY advise reading the label, which includes directions stating to shake the bottle vigorously before every use and to swish for at least a few (I do 3 everytime) minutes. Doing these things are absolutely key. All in all, absolutely superb product. Traditional mouthwash and mouthcare like Listerine or Colgate don't even classify on the same level. Uncle Harry\u2019s miracle mouthwash, and their other oral care are on a completely different level. I really can't say enough to mimic how effective it is and how much I enjoy taking care of my oral health with Uncle Harry\u2019s!", "This stuff is great. The taste is a bit salty at first, but pleasant once you get used to it. My mouth feels so good after I use this and I enjoy the taste of cloves and mint. (I love both of those spices.) It's too soon to know for sure, but I do feel this and the similar products I'm using are helping my dental health.\n\nThe value for money is better than I'd expected because it's very powerful strength. Even though it is expensive I find I can use a small enough amount that the bottle is lasting a reasonable amount of time.\n\nBe sure to shake it each time before use. It's easy to forget but makes a big difference as the ingredients settle.", "Works great. For some reason I developed gum issues even though I had no problems in past and always took good care of teeth and gums. I decided to stop using all the big name brand dental products especially since there is sodium laurel sulfate in some toothpastes which apparently some people can have allergic reactions to. I've been using an sls free toothpaste and the Miracle Mouthwash and my gums are doing much better. I have not had an issue with my taste being altered as some have complained about with this product but I use it at night or after eating when there will be some time before eating again. I use it at half strength if I use it during the day and full strength at night. Excellent product.", "I love this stuff. I haven't found a mouthwash I liked since the My Magic Mud brand became impossible to find (except in cinnamon, bleh!). Definitely dilute it as instructed. I use tap water since procedurally it's too difficult to use filtered water day-to-day, and my dentist and I noticed the difference, in my gums especially, right away. I had been having irritation and some bleeding with flossing. Not having that issue anymore! It does have a burn to it, which I find more pleasant than the type of burning I experience with alcohol-based mouthwash. Gargling is so much more productive than with any other mouthwash I've used so far. I'm a fan ^.^\nNote: mustard is a listed ingredient, but I can't taste it. I believe it's medicinal and not intended for flavor.", "Uncle Harry's salty, alkaline, natural mouthwash has made for a healthier mouth.

When it came to potty training, I found it was difficult for her to remove the cloth diapers because the majority of my stash had snaps. We tried letting her run naked while at home, but there were more messes than I could handle. We switched to these and potty training has been a breeze. My daughter feels like she's graduated to \"big girl diapers.\" She can pull them down herself, so she feels more independent. We have yet to have leaks or a blowout with these diapers. We tried the Pampers brand Easy Up's and prefer these. Huggies Pull-Ups have easy open sides whereas Pampers do not. It's not fun trying to inch a diaper filled with a particular messy \"load\" down your kicking toddlers legs. You could pull at the sides very hard and they'd eventually rip down the sides, but I'd much rather have the easy pull tabs built in. My daughter moves easily in these and the designs are cute, to boot.", "I am normally a Pampers fan for regular diaper, but when it comes to pull ups, I think the Huggies is better. The best feature is the side velcro opening which makes changing in public so much easier. Also, my daughter is small for her age, so the ability to adjust through the velcro makes it more secure than the Pampers pull ups. We also tried the Target brand pull ups also with the velcro strip, but it's not as secured. We had an accident with leakage with the Target ones, and we realized when changing my daughter that the velcro came off as she was climbing around. So, out of the ones we tried, we think the Huggies is the best fit.", "You're going to get Minnie Mouse or other easily found character. But, i got a brand new package of Minnie Mouse Pull Ups.", "I've always preferred Pull-Ups brand training pants for all my kids during potty training. The daycare center my girls go to also prefer Pull-Ups because their velcro sides make them easier for changing so I signed for a subscription through Amazon. The last couple of packs of Pull-Ups I've gotten seem to be a bit different than what I am used to, the sides where the velcro is seem to be made from a much rougher (probably cheaper) material. I'm actually really displeased with how rough they are now and have decided to stop using them. I have discovered that Target Up & Up brand training pants also have velcro sides but are much softer than Pull-Ups, and from my experience, they seem to hold up as well as the more expensive Pull-Ups. Too bad I cannot order the Target brand through Amazon because the subscription service makes it more affordable and significantly more convenient. Still, I am defecting from Huggies Pull-Ups and since I am potty training my last child, I probably won't go back.", "our 20 month old LOVES doc mcstuffins and she just showed interest in potty training. she hates being changed because that would mean she would have to stop playing and lay still just for a second so usually when she knows i am coming after her for a diaper change, she runs away. now, i just wave a doc mcstuffins diaper and she comes running and wants to put it on. it's so easy to slide on and off too especially since now she is learning to put on her pants and shorts. my only complaint would be these only hold maybe 1 or 2 times that she pees....then i have to change her unlike some that she can stay quite some time in after 4-5 times of peeing in.", "They're pretty much just pretty diapers with cool designs. Even though it seems like a great idea my daughter (who started wearing them at 2) never got the disappearing design concept. They're hard to slide on and off so she couldn't put them on by herself like she can underwear, even though that's what you're supposed to do with pull ups. It usually ended up with lots of frustration, sometimes scratches and / or a fit. Also, once she's figured out that the tabs on the side are there to open and take the pull up off she didn't want slide it down any more and just pulled on tabs to get it open. Also she never called them \"pull ups\", but \"diapers\" and treated them like diapers. She's never got the \"big girl\" thing out of pull ups like she did with training pants and underwear.\nAll in all they hold everything in and are pretty but in my opinion are completely unnecessary in the potty training process.", "I have only been using this brand for a few days, but so far they are way better for my daughter than the Pampers Easy-ups that i have been using for months. These are less bulky and dont sag/fall off of my daughters butt. I just prefer these over the others now.\n\nUPDATE***\nI used these on a very long road trip and they held up very well. We had no \"accidents\" with leakage which we had with other brands and traditional diapers! Plus my daughter really loves Doc McStuffins!", "My daughter is in love with Doc Mcstuffins and will only wear Doc Mcstuffins pull-ups. This product was perfectly packaged and came in unbeatable time. The great thing about this product is how well they are constructed. I have tried other brands of pull-ups and this brand, by far has the best pull-ups. They absorb and have never left my child with any sort of diaper rash. Also, they make my daughter feel like a big girl because they are designed to go on like underpants!!!!!", "These are so wonderful! We are strong believers in Pampers for diapers because Huggies gave our girls rashes. But when it came to pull-ups, Pampers doesn't even come close in quality. Huggies pullups are the best. The fact that they have resealable sides is vital when potty training especially at daycare. Who wants to completely undress a toddler who is already embarrassed because they had an accident!? No one! Also, the character options are so much more fun for the kiddos on Huggies pull-ups. Our girls love Disney characters and having choices is wonderful for incentives. Kudos, Huggies!", "These are much better than the cheaper brands that don't have the removable \"velcro-like\" sides. They are more expensive, but you dont' really appreciate it until you have to change a poopy pull up with lots of winter clothes on. Absorbancy is OK and the sides are comfortable. I don't think that the \"learning designs\" do much. I'd rather not have that and pay less (hence the 4 stars)", "These are good and do not leak. My kids cannot use Huggies diapers, but for some reason can use Huggies pullups and so for the price it was great. My children love the print. :) I wish it would have actually come int he Doc Mcstuffins print though. It did not come in Doc Mcstuffins and instead came in Sophia the first print.\n\nFits like a size 4 diaper. If your child is above a size 4 I would consider buying the next size up", "Love it.4 stars because of the resealable sides.the only draw back is the resealable sides sometimes don't reseal.but it doesn't leak, it's thin not bulky a droopy when wet. Looks good under clothing. Its almost as if you're wearing regular underwear .a little pricey compared to pampers pull ups.which is also good but the resealable sides won.", "I purchased these pull ups after debating on getting the pampers but noticed that my daughter started having a rash after the pampers swaddlers so bought these instead and so far it's working great. My daughter is 20 months and she's almost potty trained. She loves the designs on the pull ups and that's the only reason she'll wear them. I love the fact that it has resealable sides that I can check for wetness. Sizing was a perfect fit. We'll definitely purchase more when needed", "Good diapers but I wish they would just sell minnie mouse ones in a big box like this because my daughter just wanted to wear the minnie ones :)", "My daughter got so excited for potty training once I got her these pull ups. They're absorbent enough for accidents but she can't wear them as long as diapers which makes it easier for her to realize she's wet. We don't really use the side tabs but it does make them sturdier for her to pull up without tearing.", "These pull ups were a lifesaver when potty training our two year old. She really liked being able to get them on and off herself. The price was right and we had a subscribe-and-save subscription that had them delivered to our house every month so there is no lugging around extra bulky boxes home from Target. The pull-ups never leaked and fit her body so that there was not any weird bulk under her pants.", "If I had known I wasn\u2019t going to get Doc McStuffins I wouldn\u2019t have ordered it. My daughter really needed the pull ups so I couldn\u2019t return them. Pissed I overpaid for Minnie Mouse pull-ups.", "I am in the beginning stages of potty training my two year old. It is a hassle most days to even change her diaper. She likes the independence of putting her feet into the pull ups herself. She also recognizes Doc Mcstuffins, Princess Sophia, and Minnie Mouse. My only problem is that they DID NOT come with any Huggies reward codes. Pampers training pants come with codes. They cost about the same. So, I may just stick to Pampers so that I can get my codes.", "I am a did reviewing this. I really do not have anything to compare it to. They do not leak...they do the job...my daughter likes the characters on the training pants.\n\nWhat else can you say? The cardboard box they came in was sturdy...had no issues with it. The plastic that surrounded the diapers...er...training pants was of sufficient thickness. No complaints.\n\nI will be glad when I do not have to buy these anymore...my income will go up by 25%!", "Not as good as other brands. I see a lot if leak through with these and they fit a little big. Used as a night time safety but wasn't what I'd hoped almost every morning we had wet through the Jammie's and sheets so lots of extra laundry. Good during the day if your little one doesn't drink much and is very well trained to hold it.

In one of the auto immune groups I\u2019m in, there were discussions about itchy scalps with little bumps that would turn scabby. You get bumps, you itch, they bleed and repeat.

Dry off your hands on a wash cloth or you\u2019ll lose that shampoo when you pour some into your palm and then rub your hands together to make a kind of white, creamy kind of looking shampoo, then shampoo that into your scalp, just as you would normal shampoo only without the coconut or jasmine notes. Repeat again if you have longish thick hair. Turn your shower up and wait for it says a minute, but I do two, due to its thickness. Turn your water down to luke warm and rinse well. You\u2019ll need a conditioner on those ends as this isn\u2019t very nourishing. I don\u2019t typically dry with a hair dryer, but I did notice the time I did, the smell dissipated more, but it was still there, those slight undertones of TCP.\n\nI noticed relief after the first try and now I use it once a week.

For a long time, I didn't know what I had - I thought an allergy to sulfates in shampoos, dandruff, etc. I tried many products to try to \"cure\" the itching and breakouts. I would even wake up in the middle of the night because of the itching.\nWhen it spread to my neck and side of my face, I got desperate. I found CLn Shampoo on line and decided to try it. The first shampoo, no change. The itching and breakouts became fewer with the second and third. By the fourth shampoo, I had no more itching. I'm at the sixth shampoo and finally feel like a normal person again. I can go to the hair stylist and not be embarassed with raw, red spots on my scalp. A few helpful hints: 1. DO wash first with another shampoo. Rinse and then use the CLN. It helps get you a lather and you'll use less shampoo. 2. When you put the CLN shampoo on your palm, rub both palms together. This will also help with the lather. 3. Massage in and let it sit for about 10 minutes. 4. Rinse with tepid water - NOT hot. 5. Use a cream rinse on all but your scalp. Otherwise, you will get dry, straw hair. 6. I used Neosporin on my face and neck and that solved that problem. 7. I have color treated hair. The bleach has affected the color. My brown with blonde highlights color has lightened considerably. Cure yourself first and then worry about the color.

My solution you ask? Wear leggings and long sleeve shirts in the 95 degree hot summer days. I tried EVERYTHING. I spent hundreds of dollars trying to find the best exfoliators, shaving cream, razors, moisturizers, after shave oils, ingrown hair treatments, even waxing strips and dipilitory creams. Nothing worked. I finally gave up and went to see my dermitologist. He recommended berenzol peroxide and a perscription for a topical lotion. In days my legs had cleared up and I was thrilled! However, my underarms still looked horrendus. I kept on with my search, deperate to find something. Then as I was scrolling through amazon, as any other person does in their free time, I stumbled upon this product. I had remembered my success with gillette venus in the past (before my skin blew up) but I had never tried these. It was exactly what I needed, smooth, sensitive razors. I clicked add to cart and within days I was in the shower putting these razors to use. I then hopped out of the shower, sat down at my vanity, and applied my razor burn treatment and moisturizer. I lifted up my arms and gasped. ALMOST NO RAZOR BURN! I ran to my computer and decided to write this review. I am beyond thrilled with this product. It changed my life. I am ready for summer!! I highly recommend for anyone who feels they have had this same issue its gonna save your underams and your confidence!", "I really like these razors.

Myoglobin is a protein that apparently stores and supplies oxygen to the muscles of vertebrates. And the more myoglobin and muscle use, the darker the meat.\n\nSince chickens don\u2019t fly (due to confinement, clipped wings and/or being bred to be heavier), the breasts typically don't develop much myoglobin. Hence white meat.\n\nBut chickens raised under free-range conditions will develop dark meat in their legs and thighs.

Both packages arrived adequately chilled (this was a delivery in February with outside temps in the 40s). They weren't partially frozen, as other reviewers have reported. So they were ready to use, and I did. They were fine.\n\nOne thing that I noticed after cooking them was something that I've observed in a variety of brands of chicken thighs that I've gotten from various supermarkets in the last decade. (But not all brands or purchases have had this characteristic.)\n\nAnd that's this:\n\nAfter cooking, the flesh of the thighs looked like white meat, not dark meat!\n\nThat can be startling the first time you observe it.\n\nAs I understand it, the more that a chicken uses its muscles, the more myoglobin those muscles will contain. Myoglobin is a protein that apparently stores and supplies oxygen to the muscles of vertebrates. And the more myoglobin and muscle use, the darker the meat.\n\nSince chickens don\u2019t fly (due to confinement, clipped wings and/or being bred to be heavier), the breasts typically don't develop much myoglobin. Hence white meat.\n\nBut chickens raised under free-range conditions will develop dark meat in their legs and thighs. (Hence the customary, notable contrast in commercial poultry in the appearance of the white meat versus the dark meat.)\n\nSo I have to conclude that the white meat in these thighs reveal that these birds led highly circumscribed, and probably immobile or nearly immobile, lives.\nRead more", "Expensive.

Sturdy and well made", "Review of the Camco Red 3/8 Stud 36\u201d Long 2-Gauge Cable - Bought this cable to connect the positive side of my solar battery bank to my Samlex 2000 Watt inverter. First thing I did was to cut the cable into about 7 inches from one end and install an ANL type 250 amp fuse between my batteries and inverter, with the fuse close to the batteries. I wired the other end to a heavy duty marine style disconnect switch. When you\u2019re running high amperage through a solar system like mine you want to have a disconnect switch in case you start seeing smoke or smell melting plastic.\n\nI\u2019ve been testing my inverter for about a week now and the heaviest load I\u2019ve powered through this cable is about 800 watts for about two minutes. The cable did not get warm. To this point this cable has met my expectations, and I will update my review if anything changes. In the future if I add more batteries to my system I will probably double up on these 2 gauge cables so I can run higher wattage devices.\n\nRecommend", "I have purchased three of these cables: 47452 (red, 4 gauge, 3/8\u201d eyelet, 48\u201d length), 47455 (black, 4 gauge, 5/16\u201d eyelet, 36\u201d length), and 47454 (red, 4 gauge, 3/8\u201d eyelet, 36\u201d length). The product is exactly as advertised in the sense that the cable remains flexible and is terminated with tinned copper eyelets. In my experience tinned eyelets are usually over-tinned creating a bulky terminal, and more often than not the tinning is sloppy at best. These cables have tight, quality crimps and the terminals are completely and cleanly tinned without adding unnecessary weight and/or dimension to the flat eyelets.

However, my poor rating/review is purely to address the horrible design in packaging by the manufacturer, and as a consequence, what problem it caused. I'll explain further below:\n\nWhen I received this item yesterday, which was sent along with several other Amazon items in a big box, the dishwashing solution had leaked and gotten ALL OVER the place - not only all over the bottles of dishwashing solution themselves, but also all over the other items sent along with them. It made a big mess of things - thick, slimy, sticky goo of ultra-concentrated and partially evaporated dishwashing solution all over - and it took us maybe close to an hour to clean everything up. Not only some, but we also lost some of the product. The problem is a simple and ridiculous flaw in the packaging of this product. The bottles have no seals in their opening, under the caps. The caps don't screw very tightly/securely, and they come loose easily, which was what had happened in transit to our home. This problem with be easily fixed by the manufacture adding seals to each bottle. This was very frustrating and disappointing.\n\nAs a side note, I called Amazon's customer service about this, and the rep only offered to comp me $5 for the inconvenience and grief. After some further explanation, she begrudgingly offered me $10. I am not one to unreasonably ask for compensation for such things, but in this case, I feel it would have been fair and reasonable to refund me for the cost of this item, and not just a measly few dollars.\n\nIn summary, this was all around a bad a horrible experience with this purchase, both with the flaw in the packaging and the huge mess and inconvenience it caused, and also with the unsatisfactory excuse of a resolution that Amazon's customer service offered.", "This is the refill for the  Dawn Ultra Platinum Dish Foam, Fresh Rapids, 10.1 Fl Oz  product, below is my review for that:\nI usually use Costco brand stuff, but when they have a sale I love to get the Dawn Plat. I saw this on sale and I wanted to give it a try. One of the major selling points for me was that you apply a pump of this product directly to your washrag, and then proceed to wash with it rather than the typical pour some soap in your wash basin, fill with water and then proceed to wash. I am hoping we could save some water along with some cash with this.\n\nAs for the performance, I am overall pleased. It takes, on average , two pumps for the entire load of dishes, but we are a family of 2 Adults and 4 kids so we usually have a decent amount of dishes to wash. I would guess for 2-3 people it would on take one. It does cut the grease with normal Dawn power. I will continue to purchase as long as the price is right, but will probably still get the regular stuff at the Costco when it is on sale.", "I have to admit that I thought the commercials were all hype and that it would be a waste of time and money! BOY WAS I WRONG! This is the best \u201cdish soap\u201d I have ever used! I always liked Dawn product but this takes the cake!

I especially like this Ultra formula, as it kicks the stuck on bits right off the dishes in a matter of minutes. I'm one of those that refuses to wash dishes in a sink full of water, as all the floaties and knowing there are mouth germs from utensils floating around is just disgusting to me. I'm so, so glad that Dawn has created this pump system for people like me, who prefer to wash under a light stream of running water instead.

They were skeptical at first, but they very quickly saw how nice it is in all the time they save in washing dishes.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that both the pump bottles in the stores and the refills shipped by Amazon have a flaw. It is too easy for these bottles to leak soap if they are upside down for an extended period of time. The postal carrier who delivered my Dawn Direct Foam refills was alarmed by liquid that seemed to be dripping from the box. During opening I feared the worse, but it turned out that only about 5% of each bottle leaked during shipping. I like the soap so much that I didn't want to return it. Dawn could improve this already awesome product if they improved their bottle designs to prevent leakage.\n\nIt is annoying that I seem unable to find these refills in stores anywhere in the southern New Hampshire or northern Massachusetts area. =(", "Dawn foaming soap cuts grease on contact!

Ok, well all of them except the Honest brand wipes, which I haven't tried, but doubt I ever will because I love these wipes.

I stocked up while I was pregnant on Huggies, but do glad I bought a few packs of these as well. The Huggies I use now to take off my makeup, but these ones are solely for my precious baby girl. They're so soft for her and don't have a scent, which I like that about them.\nThe only thing I've had problems with is when I pull one out either several come out or only one comes out without another ready to come out next, and then I have to stick my finger in the opening trying to find the seam to pull out another. I also found closing the top it doesn't always fasten shut as it should easily so I have to push it down a couple times for it to, and once the lid just completely broke off, and that was disappointing.\nFor me, the pros definitely outweigh the cons, so I'll continue to use them for my baby and will do so again for whenever I have another baby too.

It is difficult to pull out just one and impossible to stick the rest back in. So...how many times have you needed to pull out a wipe in a frenzy? Be careful, and make sure only one comes out. If you're standing next to your baby, use two hands.\n2. They don't smell great. I don't have a problem with this, though, because they don't really smell at all...\"Fragrance free\" is one reason I buy them. Do they smell a little bit, YES, but they do have cleaning stuff in them. Do they smell bad or chemical-y, NO.\n\nThese wipes are big, tough, and soft. I used Seventh Generation wipes at first because my sister-in-law swears by them, but I thought they were terrible. They were small, so I had to use more than one more often than not, even though they were thick - I've found it's about the wipes surface area, not the thickness of the wipe.

The texture is also very well constructed and more so like a piece of cloth woven together than a normal wipe which makes them very durable and strong.

Rinse/spin, then leave the diapers in there and add other baby stuff (clothes/blankets/bibs) and run a normal load (with a bit more than the recommended soap on product) on warm.

It's worked very well for that purpose. My 10 month old has eczema, and this detergent has give her no problems at all. My only issue whatsoever with the great laundry soap is the price. If money were no issue I'd use this more frequently, but being cost conscious I've found that the  Purex Ultra Baby Liquid Concentrated Detergent 33 Loads, 50 Ounce (Pack of 2)  works just as well, and is much more affordable. I do buy this from time to time, because my local stores tend to stock this rather than other baby detergents such as Purex. I'll also purchase this when I see that it's on sale.

As is our usual routine, once we get home from daycare, I usually give him something to drink and a snack depending on whether or not we\u2019ve had dinner.\n\nThe beverage of choice ranges from fruit punch, blue Gatorade, apple juice, water, or milk. No soda.\n\nI filled up an 8 ounce spill-proof cup with Crystal Light fruit punch and handed it to him.\n\nTwo minutes later I sent him upstairs to release the dogs from their kennel so they could eat dinner and go outside.\n\nBeing the obedient little boy he is, he went upstairs and let the dogs out and they came tearing down the stairs as usual, wolfed down their food, and then I took them out to the yard for probably 3-4 minutes.\n\nWhen I got back inside, He handed me his cup and said, \u201cDad, I need more drink please.\u201d I said, \u201cWow, you must be thirsty!\u201d and refilled the cup. We sat and chilled in the living room for about 90 minutes or so playing with LEGOs, got some of his homework done, etc.\n\nI was just about ready to have him head upstairs and put his pajamas on, but I decided to go up first and throw a load of laundry in the wash machine so it would be done by the time I went to bed later in the evening.\n\nAs soon as I got up to the first landing, something caught my eye on the carpet and I looked down. And then I looked around me. I stood for a moment stunned. From the very first stair beginning in the living room, up to the landing, up the second flight of stairs, down the hallway, around the corner and into the bonus/dog\u2019s room and to the kennel was a trail of bright red fruit punch. Not just a couple of drops of red here and there...but a zig-zagging continuous line broken up only by each stair. I reached down and put my hands on the spot. It was bone dry.\n\nAt this point I wasn\u2019t sure if he unscrewed the cap off his beverage or if I didn\u2019t secure it tight enough, whatever\u2026 It didn\u2019t really matter at this point it was too late. I asked him if he realized that his juice had spilled, he said no and looked shocked and really scared when he saw the carpet. He apologized profusely. I told him it was okay and that I would clean it up after he went to bed and not to worry about it. Based on the fact that he didn\u2019t notice it, I figured he may have knocked the cup over or put it on the floor to unlock the kennel, and then on the way back downstairs is when it started to leak is my guess.\n\nOh well. This is why I bought a carpet shampooer I thought to myself. I took some Oxiclean carpet shampoo, diluted it in a spray bottle, and pretreated the trail of red so it could soak in while I prepped the shampooer.\n\nI ran that damn carpet shampooer back-and-forth across the stain with heated Oxiclean carpet shampoo for over an hour and all it did was turn the dark red into a lovely shade of pink. As a bonus, the now saturated pink stain actually increased the width of the original stain!\n\nThe next day I called a few professional carpet cleaners, and once they found out what the stain wise they all said the same thing: Minimum of $350-$500 and they could not guarantee that the stain would come clean.\n\nI did some research on Amazon, thinking I could not be the only one that has ever been blessed with a red Kool-Aid like stain on beige or white carpet.\n\nI stumbled upon \u201cRed 1\u201d Kool Aid Remover. After reading several reviews, the vast majority of them were positive and said that this stuff worked when everything else failed.\n\nI figured this was my Hail Mary pass. Either this stuff was going to work or I was going to end up spending money I didn\u2019t have to professionally clean the carpet or end up replacing the carpet early next year with my whatever income tax refund I might get.\n\nI followed the directions and pre-treated every pink fiber of carpet, using nearly 3/4 of the bottle. Depending on how deeply set the stain was, the instructions said, the red would either disappear within an hour or you would have to add heat to the treated area to release the stain. It suggested using a steam iron over a towel or terry cloth or a steamer.\n\nI have a large garment steamer that I\u2019ve had for years, and decided to try that versus the risk of melting my carpet onto the bottom of an iron.\n\nWithin the first minute of the steam penetrating the carpet, the stain lighten significantly, and then disappeared! To my amazement every section I ran the steamer across and then blotted up with a towel...the towel turned pink and the stain on the carpet was gone. It took an hour and a half this evening to carefully go over every single area that was affected, but now it looks like the accident never happened at all!\n\nTrust me, if you spill something artificially colored red on your carpet, buy this stuff or have it on hand. Wine is a different story, because that is a natural dye and you can usually get that up with Oxiclean or a special red wine cleaner. Industrial red dye and/or artificially-colored red beverages like Kool Aid or Crystal Light are a completely different story!\n\nThank you Red 1, Your product was worth every penny of the $30 I spent!

My hubby tried a few months back to get this shampooed out of rug with still no luck. This product worked after first use even after it being there for over a year! Worth trying on your stubborn stains!", "I recommend this product highly if your stain is from Red Dye #40. It is heat activated and when this stuff touches Red Dye #40, it isn't Red Dye #40 anymore; it isn't even red. It works in a minute.\nI would not use ammonia, seltzer, vinegar or anything else on Red Dye #40. Trying to separate the dye from the fiber so you can get it all out will lead to many iterations after which a trace of the dye will remain. Even if I had to wait a long time to get Red 1 (or one of the other products that work the same way) I would not use a detergent or traditional cleaning agent.\nThe instructions on the bottle aren't very specific and I've read stories of people using very long dwell times and I've read suggestions that you limit dwell time to two minutes. Red 1 doesn't seem to hurt my particular carpet if left on for 10 minutes.\nThe stain I was treating was a series of drip spots that, in aggregate, covered only a small area. I used a pipette to deliver the Red 1 to the stains only while leaving the adjacent clean carpet dry. This seemed prudent when I hadn't used the product before but now I would just lay it on heavy as I found the fear of harm unwarranted in my case (YMMV, my carpet was not fragile). I've also found it better to vacuum-extract the excess Red 1 and refrain from rinsing until the stain is completely gone.", "I used the product on commercial grade carpet and did exactly what I needed done.", "So I ordered this stuff after deciding that I wasn't willing to try all of the home remedies and other solutions that people offer for ways to remove red stains. I decided I wanted my FIRST try to be my ONLY try. So I searched the internet then searched through these reviews and landed on this stuff. My before and after images honestly do this stuff no justice because there are so many shadows in the pictures. You should also know that my before pictures are pictures of red stains that had been sitting in my carpet for over 5 YEARS! And you should know that I had already paid two different professional carpet cleaning companies to come out and clean my carpet over the years and they both always ended by saying red stains cannot be removed. You should know that this was not an easy task and it actually did take several attempts for this stain, I'm sure because it was so old. It was several rounds of placing a warm iron on the stain with the towel on top in order to completely remove it but with diligence, it was 95 percent gone after about 30-40 minutes of persistence. Another important note is that this stuff has an EXTREMELY STRONG ODOR. It is along the lines of an industrial strength ammonia smell and it is so strong that I had to wear a mask in order to work with it for this extended period of time and open all windows in that room and we kept the front door open for ventilation. That didn't deter me from using it, but I do think this is an important note for those who decide to order it so that they can be aware of this. I have now removed almost all of the red stains from my cream carpet. I completely recommend this product and will be ordering more to have on hand since I have already finished off the first bottle.", "I really wished I had thought to take pics of the HORRIBLE, BIG, RED stains, on my very light camel colored carpet and the end results from using Red 1. Our Beagle puppy found packets of my son\u2019s \u201cDEEP RED\u201d sports drink powder mix and chewed them open and drug them over the carpet. Leaving behind a trail, 2 lighter stained spots and 3 very stained large areas. I was able to remove a \u201c5 year old\u201d red Gatorade stain, that even our professional carper cleaners, that do our carpets every 6 months, couldn\u2019t remove.\nThis is the process that worked very well for me, after figuring it out during the removal process of the first stain. It took repeating the process about 10x per stain. This is the process, which may or may not work for you:\n(I tested an area of my carpet, in a non-conspicuous place, inside of a closet, in the corner, to make sure it didn\u2019t permanently remove color or cause additional damages)\nI) Get an iron and fill with water. Have additional water ready to fill the iron up several times, depending on size of stain.\n2) Get a clean towel and have it ready to use.\n3) Put Red 1 in a clean spray bottle\n4) Thoroughly saturate all stained areas with Red 1\n5) Begin with a stain, spray additional Red, use iron mister, from above spray onto stain, several times\n6) Put towel on stain\n7) Set iron on towel and use steam from iron to saturate the towel\n8) Move iron back and forth on stain several times\n9) Lift towel off and assess stain\n10) Repeat process, over and over, using a clean area of the towel each time, and additional Red 1", "This product worked on an old (over a year) red popsicle stain that was in my cream colored carpet. I tried dozens of products before Red 1 and none got rid of the stain. Follow the directions on the bottle. Spray Red 1 on carpet stain and let sit for 20 minutes. Get your white towel wet, iron on high w/ steam, and press for 5 second, repeating until stain is gone. It took 2 applications for it to work. Highly recommend for red food stains.", "Reading the reviews I didn't even use it correctly, I didn't dampen the towel or wait 20 minutes. I had to work harder at it but, I was quite pleased. It's an old carpet but I just couldn't afford a new one yet. Trashy tenants technically destroyed my carpet, but I think I got one more needed run, before I can afford to replace it.", "If you have a red stain on your carpet, this is a must. Spray the carpet, cover with a towel, add heat to it\u2026. It will come out!!!", "I used this product to treat a code red Mt. Dew stain and it did well. I saturated the stain and covered with a damp white cotton towel. I used my Rowena steam iron on the wool setting for 5 second increments. I repeated this process twice. The white cotton towel absorbed the color residue. I recommend!", "After 13th birthday party orange pop was spilled on my gorgeous Pottery Barn wool rug and we tried Dawn and water and white vinegar and Spot Shot and nothing worked. I put this on there and at first nothing happened but then it started to foam white and the orange stain turned yellow\u2026I did have to use an iron ultimately over a wet towel and then it just disappeared! Super happy. Yes, the product kinda stinks but the stink will clear and my rug is saved.", "So I bought it Red based on reviews. The one that came was not the one in picture because it said right on the front Kool Aid stain remover. I nearly sent it back. I am really glad I didn\u2019t. I had a big red stain from a tea called sweet and spicy containing cinnamon and other spices. Also one where my friends dog peed on the leg of a black micro fibre chair, the dye stain was red. Both stains have been professionally cleaned a few times to no avail. One has been there for 5 years. Plus I kept trying too. I poured a little Red on stains and ironed with steam.

I\u2019d almost given up on trying to get them out, I tried EVERYTHING! We rent our house and really wanted our deposit back when we moved out but I knew with these huge red stains that wasn\u2019t gonna happen. I stumbled upon this stuff on Amazon and figured why the heck not. Y\u2019all , this stuff worked amazingly well, you can not even tell where the stains were anymore. You do need to use steam heat and it may take more than one try but don\u2019t give up!

I tried the new bottle on vacation and it works great - no rashes or stomach pain. I will continue to use, but may have to find another place to order it from if I get another bad one.\n\nPrevious Post...\nI have been gluten intolerant for several years. I found this product in a health store a couple of weeks before I was going to travel to my home town and decided to give it a try since I was already nervous about finding foods I could eat on vacation. I decided to wait to try it out on my favorite bakery, then my favorite sub/pizza shop since it would be worth the 2 days of terrible stomach pain if it didn't work.\n\nWell, it worked - no stomach pain, bloating, etc. I ended up using it quite frequently for the entire trip and felt great. However, after about a week from the start of the trip, I had really bad pain in my joints - I had forgotten how bad my joint pain was before I gave up gluten. Thinking it may have been a fluke, I used GlutenEase frequently again and had the same increase in joint pain, plus I've started breaking out in a rash on my chest. So now I still use GlutenEase, but sparingly (maybe a couple of times per week) and have found that the joint pain and rash are not an issue.\n\nSome others have said that it even helps aleviate symptoms after accidental ingestion. I agree it helps, but only slightly for me (still have stomach pain, not usually as sharp, and it usually only lasts for 1 day instead of 2 days). I have found that the product is most effective if I take it at least 5 min. before I have gluten. Also, I will take a second capsule if I have something else with gluten more than an hour after I've taken the first one.\n\nIn summary, it is a good product that really helps for eating out or on vacation. It works for abdominal issues, but not joint pain so use sparingly. Besides, if you are having a reaction to something you should probably listen to your body and avoid it if at all possible.

After reading reviews, I decided that I would try taking 4 pills with gluten, and then step the dosage up or down from there, depending on my reaction.\n\nThe first thing I tried them with was a flat bread sub from Subway. I took 4 pills with the sandwich; it did not end well. Almost instantly my symptoms started to appear and I decided to avoid gluten for the rest of the week.\n\nThe second thing I tried the pills with was pizza. I ordered a thin crust pizza from Domino's (this was before they offered gluten-free crust) and took 4 pills. To my surprise, I was able to eat an entire medium sized pizza without any gluten side effects!\n\nSo then I decided to step it up and try the regular hand-tossed pizza crust. This time I took 6 pills and was able to eat the whole medium-sized pizza without my gluten side effects. Or at least that's what I thought. Taking the pills prevented my immediate side effects from showing up (headache, dizziness, feeling tired), but after an hour my stomach started to make really loud sounds, which kind of worried me, but I had no pain at that point. 30 minutes later, the pain kicked in, and it was real bad.\n\nSince I began taking this product, I have used it a bunch in different circumstances. It has definitely helped me when I've been eating out or on trips where it is difficult to find gluten-free foods. It seems to be different for every person, depending on their gluten sensitivity levels, so you will just have to figure out what works for you. In my case, I have learned to stick to eating gluten-free as much as possible, but when it's not possible, I will take some of these pills and eat the available items that contain the least amount of gluten. When I first started with this product, I was hoping it would allow me to enjoy my favorite gluten foods again. But alas, after testing it out, it seems that the pills only help me when ingesting smaller amounts of gluten.", "Took before eating gluten.

And IT'S TERRIFIC TO KNOW THAT AN ALL PURPOSE CLEANER CAN TRULY BE AN EFFECTIVE GLASS CLEANER ALSO & THE 1 PRODUCT CAN REPLACE BOTH the All Purpose & the Glass Cleaner I've been using so far from 7th Generation thanks to their \"free & clear\" options making them the only cleaning products I've been able to use so far without problems along with the ECOS Free & Clear Liquid Laundry Detergent. Interestingly, the only non \"free & clear\" & not even all-natural cleaning product I can use so far is the \"Bar Keepers Friend Soft Cleanser\". Its much better cleaning power & how sparklingly beautiful it leaves tile & stainless steel surfaces makes it worth using for tough dirt. However I keep hoping to find a better & all natural solution as its ingredients are not ideal & it brings a slight smell that my housecleaner who has asthma can't handle but for some reason I can handle. I HAVE FOUND THAT EVEN AMONG CHEMICALLY SENSITIVE PEOPLE, OUR TOLERANCE FOR DIFFERENT CHEMICALS/INGREDIENTS CAN BE HUGELY DIFFERENT which can make it complicated to know what will work for each person which is why I usually prefer to stay with the \"Free & Clear\" group of products as I've never had those cause me a problem though they are often less effective for tougher dirt than more commercial solutions. FORTUNATELY I HAVE RECENTLY DISCOVERED CERTAIN WEAVES OF MICROFIBER CLOTHS THAT TRULY DO ENABLE TERRIFIC CLEANING OF MOST SURFACES (even to remove soap scum!) WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY CLEANING PRODUCT BUT IT IS STILL HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME GOOD CLEANING PRODUCTS ON HAND for stains or times when the cloth is not enough on its own. Casabella's pink stainless steel microfiber cloth I found at Bed Bath & Beyond in 2007 still remains my hands down favorite in terms of thickness & the feel & quality of the fabric + how great it is at absorbing water so it rapidly dries at the same time as it cleans my stainless steel sink beautifully when there's not much dirt. But I recently discovered an even more awesome stainless steel & glass cleaning cloth that leaves all my bathroom fixtures + kitchen sink & glass table sparkling & so easily too. It's the 16x16 \"Microfiber Stainless Steel Cleaning Cloth Wine Glass Cloth Window Cleaning Cloths(pack of 6)\" made by Sinland which currently sells for $12.45 for the Blue & Purple pack. That is the one I recommend for the ideal weave & fabric for stainless steel & glass to rapidly & easily end up gleaming + it's very helpful to have the mix of colors because it enables easy & rapid differentiation e.g. of dry vs. wet cloth &/or to keep different types of applications separate. The fabric they use is awesome - it looks & feels luxuriously silky & soft yet it is quite thick & it has an almost identical weave as the 3-pack of blue stainless steel cleaning cloths made by Pro Chef Kitchen Tools that I had previously thought was the best cloth for stainless steel & glass. So it's been terrific to find an even better cloth that should last longer as it is thicker & it's more than 3x cheaper per cloth given current pricing of each option.\n\nI still use the pink Casabelle cloth to initially dry the sink if it's very wet as that cloth is thicker & more like a towel + I want to save the awesome thinner stainless steel cloth for the sparkling finish & even better clean it uniquely enables. So I use that for the finishing touch & also for any spot cleaning or drying needs as if there isn't a lot of water that needs to be soaked up, its absorbency is more than enough.\n\nAND for an ideal way to quickly dry at the same time as it cleans & removes soap scum from my shower walls, I've been loving the simplicity & convenience & texture of Glacier Car Care's 24x36 \"Microfiber Drying Towel - Large, Super Absorbent, Fast Dry Cloth for Car, Hair, Dish, Bath & More\". It doesn't clean stainless steel fixtures as well as the stainless steel cloth as that brings a finer weave so so far those 2 types of cloths have been well worth adding & they have made it a joy to have chemical-free terrific cleaning results very easily & rapidly & super simply. I have since found some other similarly large microfiber drying towels that work similarly & for less cost but their fabirc isn't quite as fine or silky so for my shower stall this one remains my favorite because it looks & feels finer & fits in better. But the 22x30 Yepal yellow 380 GSM for $9.99 & the $12.95 \"Autofiber Big Thirsty Microfiber Waffle Drying Towel 25\"x36\" (Grey)\" which actually is more of a taupe-brown in color both work well for large areas that need drying. I ALSO FOUND THAT BROWNISH MICROFIBER CLEANING/DRYING CLOTHS WORK BEST FOR AREAS WITH HEAVIER DIRT SUCH AS CAR WINDOWS because most cleaning cloths seem to absorb dirt in a way that is hard to remove without bleach which all microfiber cloths specify should not be used. When I addressed this problem with the person who does my window cleaning, they said A CHAMOIS CLOTH WORKS BEST FOR THE FIRST LAYER OF TOUGH/EXTERIOR DIRT as that fabric enables the dirt to be rinsed off easily simply with water.\n\nSO WHAT I FOUND EASILY ENABLED STREAK-FREE GLEAMING WINDOWS USING EASILY ACCESSIBLE CLEANING PRODUCTS THAT DON'T AGGRAVATE MY CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES was to follow the recommendations of a friend who used to be a professional window cleaner i.e. to fill a 32 oz spray bottle using 1/4 of the recipe he'd found worked best of the many products & mixes he tried out = in 1 gallon of water mix 1/8 cup of vinegar & 1/2 teaspoon of dishwashing soap (he used Dawn but my free & clear 7th Generation dish liquid worked fine despite being a milder & gentler soap). It did prove so much easier to have a spray bottle one can hang on one's belt than to have to carry around a bucket full of liquid that can easily spill. THEN first getting the exterior dust off using a microfiber duster followed by the Ettore scrubber & squeegee from the $16.23 65000 Professional Progrip WINDOW CLEANING Kit while using the chamois to dry the squeegee each time meant that all the exterior dirt was gone by the time by the microfiber drying towel enabled the finishing touches for totally dry screens & streak-free gleaming windows. So we only needed 2 drying microfiber towels for all my 14 windows + screens & glass doors. The best part is that those drying towels then only required easy handwashing with my nice & gentle ECOS free & clear liquid laundry detergent to come out looking like new which was such a relief vs. previously having had to throw out any cloths used for exterior windows because the amount of dirt that lodged into the fibers of the cotton rags/towels proved impossible to fully remove even with extensive soaking in bleach because I can't handle strong detergents.\n\nHOWEVER, EVEN WITH FINDING ALL THE ABOVE GREAT CLEANING SOLUTIONS, A TERRIFIC ALL PURPOSE CLEANER THAT ALSO ENABLES STREAK-FREE GLASS CLEANING WOULD HELP SO MUCH IN CONVENIENCE including for more effective & rapid spot &/or large area cleaning when a lot of dirt has accumulated. THUS I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT PURACY'S ALL-PURPOSE CLEANER WILL SOON BE AVAILABLE IN A \"FREE & CLEAR\" VERSION AS THEIR CUSTOMER SERVICE & CLEAR CARING ABOUT TRULY NATURAL & ECO-FRIENDLY YET EFFECTIVE PRODUCTS IS OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY INCLUDING SUPER RAPID REFUND which makes this such a quality & trustworthy company to do business with & get products from.", "I'd initially gotten the more dilute formula, which is currently unavailable. I really like the scent and it leaves my counters and other surfaces clean and shiny. I made the huge mistake of frying with grapeseed oil because it doesn't smoke at high temps. I came to discover that instead it vaporizes and leaves a nasty sticky film on everything in proximity. I have a significant arsenal of cleaning products but NOTHING would remove this film that is gross and collects dust. Things even come out of the dishwasher with film intact. WALLA, this product worked on it! Not effortlessly, but it works. I'm glad to have the more concentrated product to make a quicker job of the cleanup. And I like that it is far less toxic than many other products as I've found that many safe products aren't very effective. It is now my go to surface cleaner throughout the house.", "As a housekeeper I'm always looking for multi use products that actually work, and if they are all natural that's even better. This stuff is the bomb!! It works great for cleaning standard surfaces, but I've found this is the only product I typically need to do an entire kitchen now! From stone countertops to stainless appliances, degreasing a stove backslash to getting stains out of a ceramic sink...this seems to cut through everything! And the bonus is that it smells delightful and even works for some of my clients with fragrance allergies! Hands down my new favorite cleaner!!", "I buy this one and I also buy their concentrated every day cleaner. That product is excellent also, it cleans really well and it\u2019s a good value. They have both been a staple in my low chemical household for years. This is a great alternative to other laundry stain removers. It works very well and it\u2019s so much less toxic than the rest. If I have an old stain, I use The Laundress instead. But for your every day pretreating of ordinary stains, this is great", "Cleans very well!", "I love the scent of this cleaner and how well it works on my quartz counters. However, my last couple orders, the spray bottle breaks within a couple uses and can no longer be sprayed. I have to pull a spray topper off another cleaner and put it on this bottle, which I find annoying, considering this cleaner isn't exactly cheap. I won't be purchasing again until they make a better quality sprayer.", "Not abrasive and smells really good.", "Love this product\nDiscrete scent and dies the work\nUse it and almost everything", "Not only does this product smell amazing, but it also works great on all the multiple surfaces listed on the instructions. Very convenient and I always get compliments on how the house smells great!", "I have been using this product for 2 years. I use it to clean kitchen counters, cabinets, stove top, oven hood, etc. It is a bit expensive but all-natural and effective. Recently I noticed that the trigger sprays that come with each bottle have become flimsy and stop working. I can reuse other trigger sprays of higher quality but will do so with a different product", "We've been using this in our household for several years as our everyday cleaner for quick jobs. It's great for countertops, cooktops and other surfaces. It does what you want a general-purpose cleaner to do: get the surface reasonably clean, with little to no soaking and without leaving streaks. We still use specialized cleaners for specific tasks, but this is what we reach for by default 90% of the time, and it's never disappointed.\n\nThe really exceptional thing about Puracy is how it smells! I've never used a cleaning product that smelled as good as this. It's fresh without any hint of artificial.", "So far, I really like Puracy products. Their Lavender-Vanilla hand soap is the best! I can't stop using it and enjoying it, even though a half full bottle of Softsoap is still sitting there, neglected. Because of my hypersensitivity to strong smells and chemicals (Sensory Processing Disorder), I really dislike the usual harsh cleaning products that are popular on store shelves. Recently, a particularly disgusting \"lemon\" scented cleaning/ disinfecting wipe was driving me crazy, and I needed a better solution. Since I already loved the naturally fragrant Puracy hand soap, I decided to give this Natural Green Tea & Lime Multi-Surface Cleaner a chance.\n\nThis products consists of 2 huge spray bottles of natural and gentle, yet effective, liquid cleaner. I was surprised at how large the bottles were. It makes it a bit awkward for me to use while it's full, but it can easily be transferred to smaller spray bottles. The scent is not particularly intoxicating, but it's absolutely natural, subtle and tolerable. It's so much better than the smell of strong, nasty chemicals, and it doesn't have any foreign or harsh ingredients inside. I gave one of the 2 bottles to my mom and she was pleasantly surprised. She told me she really liked the scent, and that it worked well for her. She had never used a pure, natural cleaning product before, and neither had I.\n\nI first tried spraying my bathroom mirror several times with this solution. I turned away for about 30 seconds, then turned back to wipe the mirror off. To my surprise, the liquid solution had almost completely dried by itself. Only a tiny portion of it was still wet. So this stuff dries faster than most cleaning solutions.\nThis all-purpose spray has been efficient in cleaning everything in my bathroom. Although something else should be used for really heavy-duty jobs, this spray is perfect for everyday use on a variety of surfaces. It makes me feel really comfortable with cleaning areas that I use frequently, or that I eat on, including my glass bedside table, the kitchen table, the lamps, the mirrors, my phone and tablet screens, etc. With harsher, toxic cleaning sprays, I felt like if I dropped a piece of food on the counter after cleaning, I couldn't eat it. But that's not right, and all home products should be safe for everyone to use.\n\nFor those of you who are aware, our phones and tablets are germ hotels with no vacancy. I hate knowing this, since I use both all the time. But I can't exactly toss this in the dishwasher, nor can I comfortably use a strong, smelly cleaner. So what do I do? I spray a tissue with some of this cleaner, and carefully rub my whole phone clean. It instantly removes fingerprints, dirt, dust and other gross things we can't even see. Of course avoid soaking the phone with too much solution, but I found this method to be a great solution. Oh, pun unintended.\nI know what's inside this bottle, and I know that none of it is toxic or particularly harmful for me. The smell is a fairly subtle lime scent that doesn't bother me at all. I make my own cleaning sprays now, using this cleaning liquid as a base, and adding essential oil blends to create an aromatic, antibacterial and antiseptic cleaner. I use smaller spray bottles that are more comfortable to use. These bottles are very LARGE.\n\nI'm so happy to have found this product from Puracy. I don't feel hesitant to clean all amd any surfaces now. In the past, I often got terrible headaches from smelling the old chemical cleaners in the air. Puracy seems like a really good company. I admire their efforts of creating effective natural skincare and cleaning products. I would absolutely recommend this cleaner for anybody to use on any surface in their home, apartment, dorm, hut, cave, etc.!", "I have used this for the last 4 years. It can be used on glass (dog nose prints included) and very good to cut grease on dishes as a pre-wash. I enjoy all the cleaning products from this company. The dishwasher tables are amazing too!", "We installed new DEKTON countertops and needed a product that had no chemicals and that was gentle on the brand new countertops. This product is great! lvoe it! I also clean the glass stove top with this cleaner as it;s not strong or abrassive", "It cleans everything well", "I absolutely love this cleansing spray for its non harsh chemicals and excellent cleaning ability. But I\u2019m disappointed the last few orders, the trigger on the spray bottle piece just stops working? Like the trigger has no more spring!? Puracy- can you fix this? Or can you send more spray bottle Attachments? I\u2019ve recommended this to so many people but recently the bottle trigger stops working?", "First of all I want to say that I would have given this produce a 5-Star Review if it wasn't for the cheap spray nozzles that refused to work after 2 sprays time & time again. I was hoping that it would get better, but it didn't. That being said, the product is wonderful -- cleans like it says it does and the smell is exhilarating!! Maybe I received 2 defective spray nozzles and if the Seller reads this review maybe they could send me 2 replacements so I can clean without having to remove the sprayer and pour the product on surfaces to be cleaned. Thank you!", "It has a nice light scent that is natural, I do have to say that the sprayers on the bottles all broke/stopped working before the solution was out. I was able to not have to waste the solution and put it in a clean empty spray bottle", "theres a little bit of a scent but it aint nothin like bleach or anything the scent never hangs round neither works good", "The spray bottle stopped working after only 2 weeks of use"]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NMS0BNS", "title": "Lush Decor, Pink Avery Curtains Ruffled Shabby Chic Style Window Panel Set for Living, Dining Room, Bedroom (Pair), 84 by 54-Inch", "price": "$40\n98", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81zmcL9qchL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "136 ratings", "description": "Avery window curtains feature ripples of diaphanous tiers over soft micro fiber fabric. 3\" rod pocket slides onto curtain rod for installation.

Instead, they were a bubblegum pink, like Pepto-Bismol. The site I bought them from did not allow returns so I stuffed them away in a drawer. Recently we ended up repainting and redecorating my daughter's bedroom and I got out these curtains to see if they would work with her color and they looked great, so the actual color ended up working out. Keep in mind if you buy these that they are actually bubblegum pink.\n\nAs for quality, the curtains are quite good. They look more expensive than they are and the seams look quite decent. They are soft, almost like flannel but a bit silkier than that. The ruffles at the top are a different material than the rest of the curtain; they are a sheer organza-type material that makes the curtains look lovely and elegant. I would say the curtains are a medium-light weight. They are not sheer, but they do let in some light. They provide enough coverage that you will have privacy in the room, but if you are trying to nap, they only dim the room rather than darken it.\n\nI ended up using the curtains I bought originally for my daughter's bedroom window. However, I needed to double up on them, so I bought a second pair through Amazon and added those. I also bought a third pair and used them as a door on her closet which looks better than the original door.\n\nMy daughter's bedroom looks pretty with the addition of these curtains. Her room is painted a nautical blue-green and has a fairytale/magical theme to it (unicorns, princess, etc.). These curtains give it a nice princess feel and look great paired with her wall paint. I am very happy with my purchases.\n\nI am adding pictures, but the photos are before I doubled up on the window.", "These pink curtains are very pretty in our Pink Princess's bedroom.

But they could of done a better job on the sewing", "Curtains are pretty well made and I like the style, but the other reviewers are right, the color is WAY different than the color shown in the listing. The color is a bubble gum pink not a soft pink.I wanted a softer pastel pink because they will be in my nursery, but I will make these work because I like the ruffles. Just be aware that the product photo is digitally enhanced so the color is not at all accurate. The curtains also have a series of tiny (thumbtack size) holes along the midline of the curtain. The holes don't appear to be from wear or anything, they actually appear like they served a function at the factory because the holes are all uniform and aligned. It doesn't bother me because they are not visible unless you are up close inspecting the curtains, but it is worth noting on the review.", "I don\u2019t feel like these are as pretty in person as they are in the photo.

I opted for the inexpensive rugs since my tiny Yorkie prefers the short trip to the carpet vs using the doggie door at night and it's the reason we changed out carpeting for the hardwood flooring in the first place. Something nice looking AND inexpensive is what I was going for since I expect to break out the steam cleaner every now and again.\n\nThe rugs and 1/4\" rug pads arrived within days of ordering. The 8 x 10 arrived rolled while the 10 x 13 arrived folded. The rugs are a little thin and is one reason I bought the rug pads. The other reason was I wanted rug pad with rubber under it to protect the hardwood flooring in the event my fur baby opted for carpet vs the lawn.\n\nI unfolded both the rug pad and 10 x 13 rug and placed them where I would need to move the bed back to. I have a king 4 poster Tuscan bed that has to be taken apart to be moved; it weighs a ton. It was originally moved to the sitting room area so I could paint that bedroom side and we were now ready to move the bed back.

I guess I'll be shopping locally for the rugs. I have one that we bought at Home Depot about 15 years ago and that one is still in excellent shape and better yet, it never smelled!\n\nAnything that puts out a smell like this cannot be good to breathe long term.

I feel the product cleans but value of being cost effective will depend on materials usually washed and frequency. Based on the info I include below, I believe its most cost effective for lighweight material loads; less store space needee due to concentrated formula, lightweight and does clean. Good for individuals who cant lift heavy bottles. The jury is still out if cost effective for large loads or washing dense materials.\n\nI do lots of laundry weekly in a commercial double load machine. As with traditional laundry detergent, the amount of capfulls used is dependent of size of load and density of material washed. I used 4 caps for a load with a comforter and 2 or three other small items. I used 4 for a load of scrubs of mixed material ( cotton, polyester/ cotton blend), sweat pants and jeans. But for a load of all heavy white cotton items - socks, towels, underwear - I used about 6 caps plus 2 of another traditional detergent and bleach. These came out great. For another load that almost filled the washer , composed of a mixture of materials, sweats: jeans, socks , dishclothes, etc...i used about the same volume of detergent as the cotton whites. Unfortunately , the load came out with soap residue and had to rewashed again to rinse. In comparison, if one lookd at how much of the machine was filled, you would think the larger load would use more detergent.

Have been consistently using it since I first purchased it about a year ago!", "Storytime (skip below for the review of product)\nSince I have a lot of time on my hands, I decided I wanted to try and reset my hair. I tend to wash it every day and after 24 hours it is oily again. I know this is a vicious cycle because the more I wash it the more oily it will get, but never really had the time to try and stop that. Well, now since I'm working from home I do, without having to subject everyone to what would be my nasty, oily rat's nest that my hair would soon morph into.\n\nEnter Brickell Shampoo. Went online and searched for ways to help my hair be less oily for longer. Researched what products to use and things like that. I have long hair so I was looking at a lot of women's hair advice, which really helped. I then stumbled upon Brickell, an article on their website I believe, about how to help get rid of the oil. Looked at their shampoo product and it had a lot of the good characteristics of a shampoo that I needed to use to get my hair back in line. So I thought why not?! Ordered it on here (Got a Prime card) and gave it test once it got in.\n\nThe Review:\nSo, got to finally test it and at first it was a bit weird for me. I'm used to high sudsing clarifying shampoo, so this was a bit different for me. When I first popped open the bottle, I noticed the wonderful peppermint smell (I love peppermint and use goat's milk soap that is also peppermint) so it already was making a good impression. I got some in my hands and washed my hair with it. At the time, I needed a second go, so I washed it again with a bit more of the shampoo. It felt good, so I finished up and I dried off and sprayed some of the dry shampoo in my hair (a suggestion for extra oily hair) and let it air dry. After that first use of the Brickell, I went 4 days without washing my hair again. I've never done that in my life, save for when you're camping and get all nasty and stinky anyway. My hair felt soft, healthy, and not super oily. With the help of this Shampoo, I went from washing my hair every day, to about every 3-4 days. I feels good, smells good, and does a great job with making your hair feel clean and healthy, without the intensity of all the stuff in clarifying shampoos.\n\nWould I buy it again? I already bought a second bottle, and will try the conditioner they have that goes with it as well. Wonderful stuff, Brickell, keep it up!", "I didn\u2019t realize that I was paying so much for such a small amount. I thought I\u2019d be paying for a 750ml, $20. I\u2019ll just be using a pea sized amount to make it last! And I hope it\u2019s worth it too!", "After years of using run-of-the-mill shampoo brands, I noticed my hair felt increasingly dry and flat. I decided it was time to invest a little more into hair products; I trend toward slight oiliness, so I have to shampoo daily, and it makes sense to invest more in something you'll use so frequently.\n\nMy search was thankfully short-lived. A quick google search for \"sulfate-free shampoo for men\" led me to Brickell's site, which made some impressive claims about its line of men's hygiene products- almost completely all-natural with mostly organic ingredients and little-to-no fillers. Their pricing was admittedly a bit daunting initially, coming from shampoo bottles with twice the volume at half the cost. But they offer a free sampler box of their lineup (just pay shipping), which turned out to be a very reasonable way to test drive their products with minimal investment.\n\nAfter trying the shampoo from the sampler box, I was sold shortly after. It's difficult to describe, but Brickell's shampoo just feels more pure, simple and effective. The higher cost, paired with how efficiently it cleans, taught me to make more from less- I use a dab the size of a dime every day, and it does a better job than anything else I've tried.\n\nIt smells like peppermint, washes out smoothly and leaves my hair feeling soft and full, ideal for styling. I really couldn't ask for much else. After using it consistently for an entire year now (I apparently placed my first ordered in mid-June of 2019), I've never even considered trying a different brand. I couldn't have used any more than four or five 8 ounce bottles over the year, so their 90-day estimate is fairly accurate too.\n\nAll in all, it comes out to roughly $80 a year ($6.50 a month) for great \"97% all natural, 83% organic\" shampoo that consistently does the job every day, and that's at full price- they also offer subscription pricing that's slightly better. When you put it into perspective, that's a pretty bang-up deal.\n\nThank you, Brickell, for bringing a superior and affordable men's hygienic product lineup to the table in a sea of crappy doppelganger brands.", "Smells great.", "I'm in my mid-thirties with fine, oily, short-medium length hair. I'm generally very conscious of chemicals in any product I use--I try to keep it as natural and simple as possible without being too \"granola\" with my lifestyle choices. I wanted something that had just enough cleaning power to use everyday without drying out my hair and making it more oily. Even better if I could patronize a smaller company rather than some giant faceless corporation like P&G or J&J. This shampoo met all those criteria.\n\nI've been using the Brickell shampoo for the last 9 months and the results have been fantastic!\nSome of the pros:\n- Gentle enough to use everyday, cleans my oily hair w/out over-drying\n- Nice, clean and mild manly scent\n- Leaves a healthy sheen on my hair\n- Hair does feel a bit fuller when I comb it\n- Safe ingredient list...one less thing to worry about putting on my body\n\nAs far as negatives with this product, there is very little to critique here.\nCons:\n- Has a good lather, but don't expect it to be like that synthetic stuff you might find in a grocery store. As a result, I tend to use just slightly more of this product than I did of say Dove Men Care. But only slightly.\n- Price is on the higher end. Not nearly the most expensive. Not the cheapest. But you pay for what you get\n\nSummary: If you're looking for a moderately priced non-drying shampoo from a reputable company, this is it. This is a simple choice. It does its job perfectly and no more. In fact, I've found all of Brickell's products that I've used to be excellent in delivering on their claims while avoiding all the unnecessary chemicals that other products have. Highly recommend this shampoo!\n\n*Disclaimer: I received product in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.

I see there are negative reviews and honestly I don't understand where they come from. I've used different Brickell Men's Products lotions, cleaners etc for over a year now and this shampoo is of the same good quality as the rest of their products.\nI've used a bottle of this shampoo and then switched to my other one, since I had that other one on \"subscribe and save\" subscription and I still have an unused bottle. Compared to that other organic with tea tree extracts shampoo Brickell Men's cleans better I need less of it to clean my hair. It also leaves a bit more oil on the hair and doesn't dry it as much. My hair is short and I was it twice a day, so that makes a lot of difference for me.\nI can't say if this is the best shampoo for the money, but it's a good quality shampoo and I can afford it, so that is it for me.", "I have used salon products for years. I have never bought what I would call store brands since I was honestly a freshman in high school. I've used Redken, Paul Mitchell (prior to being in the store), and most recently American Crew for years. I recently started looking to see if there was something new out there to try. I started doing some research, reading what others had to say and settled on trying Brickell Daily Shampoo.\n\nI ordered and the product arrived very quickly. Well packaged, and good updates as it was being shipped. Next morning of course I used the product. I was happy with the scent, almost woodsy with tea tree oil.. I was also happy that I wasn't paying for something that the first ingredient was \"Distilled Water\" the base for this is aloe vera. As far as a daily shampoo, it is gentle on the hair but strong enough to clean it without drying it out. Rinses out well, doesn't feel like there is residual left -on- the hair.\n\nHave been using it now for about 3 months along with an American Crew product because I don't like using the same shampoo everyday. I'm very happy with it. I have ordered twice from them now and have had no complaints with the process. I ordered a larger bottle last time with a pump.

I'm also able to nap in relative brigtness so window darkening wasn't essential.\n\nIf you look at my photo there is something hanging UNDER my curtain: it's the plastic mattress cover for my bed. I only use that cover during a move or when I put the bed in my RV for a trip, so I was able to make it double as additional window coverage. Needing more coverage is because I guestimated the width of my window and was WAY off. Haha. So I've ordered more of these curtains, so my window can be fully covered and nosy neighbors can't see in. However, the photo ALSO shows how much light is allowed through the curtain. (AND it's gray and overcast outside right now). So this photo shows these are ABSOLUTELY NOT BLACKOUT CURTAINS.\n\nI am buying one more curtain for each of my 2 bedroom windows.

Not thrilled but not upset.\n\nWhat I am upset about and why I gave only 1 star is that I do not appreciate deceptive and false advertising. Thermal properties don't exist, noise cancelling and privacy enhancement do not exist. The black out properties is a flat out LIE. I had to use my shower curtain liner in my bathroom as a window curtain until I can get a proper one. That semi opaque shower liner as a curtain is LITERALLY offering the same \"blackout\" levels as these Amazon supported curtains. And that is why it gets 1 star.

If you have resilient and hard to manage hair Bonanfide super hold will take care of you. Make sure that you apply it when your hair is not wet, not completely dry but somewhere close to being almost dry. Always rub the pomade well between your hands before application and apply it back and forth through the roots. I can have a style that holds all day with a minimal amount used. Good stuff. If you are looking for a cheaper product that works well as far as super hold pomade I highly recommend Clubman\u2019s super hold pomade. Clubman has a 16 oz tub Of super hold pomade that works very well for the price. All in all this is good stuff but if budget is an issue try Pinaud Clubman strong hold pomade.", "It\u2019s too expensive for what the product really says it does. I had a really hard time trying to keep my pompadour up and it wasn\u2019t even high. It has a nice citrus smell to it.", "I ordered the wrong item, it is too strong. I thought I could use them, but would like to just exchange 4 of them for the right ones", "This works miracles... I like how it keeps my eyebrows nice and in place the whole day but I deducted a star because of the strong smell to it. It didn't bother me at first but I felt like it followed me throughout the whole day lol", "Great product. Will continue to buy", "I love this but damn, it's expensive for that small bottle but at the same time it does the job. Holds it in place all day and if you wet your hair it will activate it again. Worth it but with a little regret.", "If you hair is hard to manage, this is the stuff for you. Scent is nice, not super strong. Bona Fide makes the best pomade and this particular one is the only one that works on my very thick and hard to manage hair. You can style it using combs, brush or your hands and this will give you the exact right amount of hold you need. I use a very small amount when I want a more relaxed look and a bit more for a more defined look. My barber even asked me what I use on my hair because he was so impressed with the way it worked on my hair when styled. The shine is not super strong and not super matter; about middle and that is how I prefer it.", "I noticed the label has changed and the product is not as thick as the 1st time purchased. Maybe the re branding has something to do with that.", "I love this stuff", "I use it for my eyebrows instead of eyebrow gel and it holds nicely and doesn\u2019t feel thick or like sticky once it is dried. My eyebrow brush does get build up quickly but it\u2019s super easy to clean off and doesn\u2019t give me any problems", "The pomade is good strong hold but the smell wasn\u2019t as great I thought it would be. I do like the hold and how easy it washes off. To pricey but I\u2019m willing to try the original because I was recommended by a friend who\u2019s a barber I just decided to get one that is strong hold because of my is tricky to comb.", "Recommended by a Youtuber, and I agree it's really good as an eyebrow gel; doesn't leave a residue and keeps eyebrow hairs in place as much as possible.", "I've gone through many pomades and this one has worked best for my straight fine hair. This has held the best for me during high humidity. I rock either a slick back with a pomp or a side part pomp. These will be great for those who don't like over-powering scent as it's somewhat scent-less. I don't use anything else but Bonafide.", "I'm a big fan of Uppercut Deluxe pomade. I've tried so many and none have compared to the hold for my thick coarse hair until Bona Fide Superior Hold. I put this right up on par with Uppercut and better in some ways. It's a little easier to use but has the same great hold. You get more for your money too. The smell might be a neg for some. It starts out with a citrus almost grapefruit like smell but then changes to a masculine smell like suavecito for me which I enjoy. If you like Uppercut deluxe you'll love this. Hope that helps", "I usually use a cream or paste with a matte finish when styling my hair when I had noticed a person i followed on social media uses Bona Fide products. I went ahead and chose up this one. It does not disappoint. The smell of the product is amazing and it does an excellent job holding\nthe hair in place. If it gets a little out of place you just need to wet your hair and style it back and bam it's good as you first put it on. 10/10 would recommend to anyone that wants to try something new or experience something amazing. You won't be disappointed. :)", "This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have tried several other products from Layrite, Suavecito, and anything else that has been recommended to me. My hair is extremely thick (when I jump in a pool and get out my roots are still dry) and this stuff will keep it slicked back all day long. I am still able to run a comb through it too which has been difficult to do when applying a lot of some other products.10/10 would highly recommend for anyone looking for a product that really does have super hold, and it smells really good too.", "It is Bona Fide for sure! I see that there is a \"Super\" Superior Hold as well. That is my next pomade purchase. The hold is excellent. I am not a huge fan of any citrus scented shave or hair product, but Bona Fide has a very mild, light and clean scent. I have other pomades that I will use for the aroma (my personal preference) but I use Bona Fide for the hold. And like they claim, it is water based and will wash right out with only water. Great product! I am an amazon prime member so I had it in two days. Love it!", "I have thick hair and have had trouble finding a product that can hold it in place during long work hours and workouts. I've been using bonafide for over a year now and couldn't be happier. I've tried numerous products over the years and only wish I had been introduced to bonafide sooner. Besides the hold and shine that the product provides, it also washes out of my hair very easily. Do yourself the favor and atleast try this out, I doubt you'll be left unsatisfied!!", "Great product for thick hair!

I opted for the inexpensive rugs since my tiny Yorkie prefers the short trip to the carpet vs using the doggie door at night and it's the reason we changed out carpeting for the hardwood flooring in the first place. Something nice looking AND inexpensive is what I was going for since I expect to break out the steam cleaner every now and again.\n\nThe rugs and 1/4\" rug pads arrived within days of ordering. The 8 x 10 arrived rolled while the 10 x 13 arrived folded. The rugs are a little thin and is one reason I bought the rug pads. The other reason was I wanted rug pad with rubber under it to protect the hardwood flooring in the event my fur baby opted for carpet vs the lawn.\n\nI unfolded both the rug pad and 10 x 13 rug and placed them where I would need to move the bed back to. I have a king 4 poster Tuscan bed that has to be taken apart to be moved; it weighs a ton. It was originally moved to the sitting room area so I could paint that bedroom side and we were now ready to move the bed back. There are some wrinkles in the rug due to it being folded for shipping but I figured that would go away over time. Other than that, the rug looks so awesome with the bright red and gold on the Acacia hardwood floor. However, as beautiful as everything looks right now, the overwhelming chemical carpet smell has overshadowed everything else!\n\nI've been up since 2:15 am!

I guess I'll be shopping locally for the rugs. I have one that we bought at Home Depot about 15 years ago and that one is still in excellent shape and better yet, it never smelled!\n\nAnything that puts out a smell like this cannot be good to breathe long term.

I think they add interest and an artistic aspect that feels more meaningful and non commercialized. The tasseled edges on the short side help make this rug look less \"cheap\". The colors are perfect for hiding the messes of pet and family life and are not gawdy bright. The negatives of this rug are that it may be too thin for some people, but nothing a decent rug pad cant fix. I think the pattern weave/loom does appear a little less elegant but for less than $200 my expectations are not unreal. I also understand shipping restrictions can be a hassle but really hated how it came all folded. Took a day to unwrinkle. Maybe the other companies that charge $100 more for this rug ship it rolled?

I ABSOLUTELY HATE pads and would always prefer tampons, however I realize how unhealthy they are. My daughter started her cycle over a year ago and I wanted to bond w/ her so I reverted to pads to be able to relate to her journey. Its been a journey however I believe THIS pad is amazing. It was SO weird because I was thinking it lessened my flow until I turned it over and saw it really is pulling the flow down into the pad, away from the body! THAT IS GREAT! Definitely a contender in this feminine flow journey!", "These infinity pads are my favorite and I don\u2019t see myself switching any time soon. they\u2019re extremely thin which may seem alarming at first but I\u2019ve never had a leak with them. I buy the largest size so I can sit and lay comfortably.

Then a friend told me they got so much better and tweaked them over the years (she too reacted with small red bumps upon their debut.) So you can understand how I was apprehensive to try them again. I\u2019m glad I did. Not only was there no reaction, but there wasn\u2019t a single leak, and I can\u2019t even feel them against my body. High and dry, and they last! (And they have a very very very light, fresh clean scent, which does the job!) When I was using another brand (Kotex) i used to have to change them every 2-3 hours on my heaviest day, and always had to be prepared for leaks. These guys have yet to leak, and last all the way to lunch and through the night. Also, when I ordered them on amazon they arrived promptly, and I like the convenience of stocking up on them and having a few boxes in the house...as you know (and dread) you\u2019ll need them every month.", "The most absorbant pad I have found yet.

The blood never leaked out or anything and I wore them for the 5 weeks that I bled postpartum but at 8 weeks postpartum I got my first period after giving birth and had a lot of these pads left over and decided to use them and it\u2019s been hell. I had a heavy period before pregnancy but now my period is crazy heavy so if you have a heavy flow these are not it. The positive thing is you feel dry and you don\u2019t feel the wetness of the blood while wearing these but that is also the problem because you can\u2019t always feel when these start to leak because they do such a great job at keeping you dry. It claims these are good for 10 hours but I can\u2019t wear these longer than 2 hours without blood leaking through my underwear and through my shorts or pants. I have to wake up every hour and a half at night to make sure my period is not leaking though. Day 3 into my period and I have leaked through 4 pairs of underwear in 2 days.

I'm just praying Always doesn't discontinue them!", "I really wanted to like these pads. I had high hopes that they would be everything they are advertised to be, but they are not. They are not long enough, they are too narrow, and the tabs are set too high up. Most importantly, however, they do not stop leaks. Every woman knows that her \"flow\" does not always drop straight down, especially when sitting or lying down. It usually trickles out, then follows the curves of a woman's body, until it suddenly pools in her butt crack and ruins yet another pair of panties and/or bedsheets, having never even touched the thirsty little pockets of her miracle pad! Forgive me for being crude, but that's the truth of it. A pad, especially an overnight pad, needs to have some curve and maybe a raised portion in the middle or the back. A little extra padding to act as a sort of dam. That may not sound comfortable to some, but I for one would sleep better at night knowing I wasn't going to be up at 3 a.m. changing my undies and bedsheets.

TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse has been recommended by dentists and pharmacists for people looking for a clinically tested oral rinse that truly combats bad breath odor at the source. Our fresh breath mouthwash eliminates halitosis (the medical term for bad breath) \u2013 instantly. TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is free of dyes, perfumes, detergents, and other harsh additives that can dry or damage the mouth. It has been approved by the ADA and is one of the United States\u2019 best-selling specialty oral hygiene treatments.\n\nDr. Katz\u2019s oral rinse works by using oxygenating compounds to attack the sulfur-producing bacteria that cause morning breath and food odor. In fact, several studies have verified that TheraBreath is extremely effective at attacking bad breath odor for over 12 hours. This safe-to-use daily oral rinse formula does not contain alcohol, artificial flavors, or colors. It is pH-balanced to maintain a non-acidic environment in the mouth, which reduces burning and enamel erosion while preventing tooth and gum sensitivity. Unlike other specialty oral rinse formulas, TheraBreath Fresh Breath Oral Rinse is available without a prescription.\n\nThis product is sold as a pack of six 3-ounce bottles and is available in an invigorating Icy Mint flavor - a taste that comes partially from the inclusion of xylitol, a natural sweetener with proven oral health benefits.

The main reason I chose this color/pattern was to bring some color into my living room and it has done that. I am pleased with this aspect. I used a year old iMac and the colors on the screen were true to the actual rug. My problem with the rug is that it is not, overall, a good value for the price because it is a fairly \"light\" rug. In other words, in my opinion, it should have been much heavier or had a much denser fiber count for the money. In regards to this, I have had the rug for about 3 weeks and one edge (about a 3 feet length) of it has not completely flattened down. I think this is due to the fact that the rug is \"light\" and that this side was the center of the roll and rolled too tightly when shipped, possibly damaging some of the fibers.

I've never known or even seen a display more than 1080p @60hz, and I've been used to this cheap Samsung T24B350 for over 3 years now. I've been looking for an upgrade for a while and Gsync seemed really important to me since obviously I have a GTX 770, however after seeing the price being only $580 (with freesync) compared to the insane prices of similar Gsync monitors, I was pretty much sold.\n\nI've read and seen all the reviews about how terrible the quality control is, but I had higher hopes than that, I mean, when people get something and their satisfied, most of the time they're going to just enjoy it, and forget about writing a review. So only the crazy enthusiasts write reviews and my theory was that they are just too picky.\n\nI ordered it on Sunday, and on Monday I saw that it was on it's way, hurray! Except I realized I accidentally ordered it to my parents' house, oops. So long story short, it got there first, and my sweet, beautiful mother had it sent to me the same day, while Amazon was kind enough to refund me the amount it cost to deliver from there to here (in college), thank you Amazon :)\n\nI got it yesterday, Thursday, all standard shipping of course, and I couldn't be more satisfied and excited about how quickly I got it. I finally brought it back and opened the package, set it up, plugged it in and turned it on. I almost instantly devastated by a few things. Aside from seeing an expected amount of IPS glow around the corners, most notably the bottom right, there was a terrible little dent up top where an unforgivable amount of backlight was completely ruining the top right portion.\n\nI was sure that I had to return it. I figured I might as well test it out in the meantime. Although I knew there was going to almost certainly be a little backlight bleed, the most obvious problem up top was unforgivable! I tried pushing the frame down and messing around with it with my hands, alas, no avail.\n\nI started using it with my computer and sweet baby cakes it was deliciously beautiful. I was blown away by the sheer picture quality, and when I finally turned it up to 120hz in Nvidia settings, I was blown away again. It was smoother than a baby's bottom. I didn't want to let go, I couldn't part with this glorious angel of a display. I tried fixing the obvious problem with my hands again. Nothing. I thought to myself \"clearly there's a crack in there somewhere,\" right? I didn't think pushing the frame down would completely fix it. I figured I might as well keep trying, I was desperate. I tired again this time using a paper card, but I couldn't squeeze it in. I used a different card, a credit card, still not getting it. I tried a different spot, the card snapped in between the clean matte bezel, and precious crystal display. I slowly and carefully slid it over towards the problematic spot, and SNAP. The bezel returned to it's proper alignment and since I had a black picture in fullscreen I instantly realized that it was fixed 100%. Returned to it's former glory!\n\nI knew that the IPS glow or AKA back-light bleed wasn't ever going to be fixed, since it's more of a core design flaw. At least at out-of-box settings, it was obvious, but I used TFT Central's review to change it to optimal settings, and it was hardly noticeable. I could not have been more satisfied. Keep in mind I'm still looking at the display with a black picture in fullscreen.\n\nI also ran some other colored pictures by to make sure there were no dead pixels, faded pixels, dust, scratches, hair, or anything else that previous owners' review had so viciously claimed.\n\nI am currently typing on this monitor now, and the text isn't too small like people have warned, Windows 10 works perfectly with it as well. Nothing out of the ordinary.\n\nI fired up a few games and they are astonishing. Dark Souls II looks okay. I tried GTA V, and it quite the experience, although I am only running a GTX 770, and getting past 100 fps is quite the challenge at 1440p, the fps was able to lock around 72, and I was fully satisfied.\n\nIn terms of work related... What can I say? Photoshop is much easier to use, more pixels, amazing color accuracy. So much screen real estate as well.\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro works fine, looks amazing, however I will post later once I finished setting up the dual monitors. Don't worry, I'm using the old Samsung monitor as a timeline, and media bin space, and the Asus as the main preview monitor. I can't wait to get used to it and see how my workflow increases, since I'm already pretty fast using just that one 24\" monitor 1080p.\n\nWhen it comes to having a freesync monitor, yet I have an Nvidia card. I don't care. Gaming is honestly secondary for me, but very important nonetheless. Although considering what I've been used to, I think I can live with having an immense upgrade of a monitor that I was able to afford rather than not be able to afford others or say, the upcoming PG279Q which I know for sure I won't want to spend that kind of money on. The biggest thing for me was IPS, 1440p and 144hz. Although I'm still trying to figure out how to increase it from 120hz to 144hz, I've been trying everything and even contacted Asus and after talking where we could both hardly understand each other, all I got was that he thought I was trying to overclock the monitor, which, as far as I know, is not considered overclocking since it's rated at 144hz, after that, I was on hold for 10-20 minutes just get hung up on, and asked for customer feedback, which I gave mostly low, in all honesty. I'm not too worried though.\n\nThis is such a joy to use. It swivels with little to no effort, it tilts up and down to any degree that anybody could ever want. The height adjustment is absolutely superb. It sits snug, and stays very fixed, and tight. When you try to move it up and down, it feels like an expensive desk drawer from Ikea but a little bit less grease. I can imagine after a couple years it will loosen, so starting it out a little tight was a very smart move. The bezel is tiny, especially compared to my old monitor. This MG279Q is a massive upgrade in every way possibly imaginable.\n\nI love playing with settings, especially display settings, and getting the right settings for optimal use, as well as personal preference is really important to me. It provides extensive customization and it will suitable for almost any environment/lighting situation. It gets very very bright, from rooms with windows, and it gets very very dim, for the dark rooms. The optimal settings I used (thanks to TFT Central) was Racing mode at 24 brightness, and RGB, at 100 96 96 respectively.\n\nThe built in sound is okay. I think it's important to have that for people who are just browsing, need to hear notifications, etc.. But I would definitely recommend headphones if you don't have any other desktop speakers. I have both, thankfully.\n\nAnyway, it didn't take long for me to fall in love with the MG279Q, and hopefully, others out there that are reluctant to spend $700+ on a similar Gsync or a similar freesync monitor that's affordable... Rest assured, I am happy with my purchase, and I'm glad I didn't wait to spend an extra $350-450 on the upcoming PG279Q.\n\nI have posted a before and after pictures of when I first turned it on, to when I fixed the bezel defect up top. Also note that the IPS glow is exaggerated in the after picture, since my room is completely dark, and the monitor is displaying full black, after changing the settings, it is hardly noticeable.\n\nFor those of you in a similar situation (big upgrade) I posted a few pictures comparing my old generic Samsung monitor to the new one. You can see obvious differences instantly in terms of contrast (on the ground) and color reproduction. It's even obvious after trying to match the lighting and white balance, etc. Enjoy :)", "-----------\nMy Story\n-----------\nAll my gaming life, I have been ultimately disappointed by gaming. Whether that is poor performance despite spending so much money (remember the horrible performance of games back in 2007? Even worse than now-a-days!) or discovering I got hardware that wasn't as good (monitors that were crappier) or went in the wrong direction (4K vs 144hz).\n\nA year ago I bought a Samsung U28D590D, which is a 4K monitor. A week after the warranty expired (1 year warranty) it got two vertical lines on it. Thankfully, I had insurance on it at BestBuy. I took it back, got a full $700 store credit. Still obsessed with getting 4K resolution for gaming, I purchased a LG 55\" 4K HDTV that was one sale for a great deal.\n\nWell, what a mistake. Apparently all 4K HDTV's except a few panasonic ones (very, very expensive) are HDMI only. As of this review, there is no HDMI 2.0 adapter, so unless you have very specific NVIDIA cards, you can't get 4K @ 60hz on them.\n\nSo there I am- stuck with three monitors. a LG 55\" HDTV w/ 4K @ 30hz, a Monoprice IPS 28\" w/ 1440p @ 60hz, my memory of the Samsung UD590 TN panel w/ 4K @ 60hz, and this purchase from Amazon at 1440p @ 144hz. All compared side by side (except the Samsung in memory).\n\nWhen I bought the Samsung UD590, which was $100 more than this Asus monitor- the TN panel was awful compared to my $300 monoprice IPS (cheapo IPS screen). For $700, it was a disappointment. But 4K was an even bigger disappointment. Although I love the extra workspace for working in Unity to make games (a full 1080p \"Game Tab\" in the Editor was awesome.) that was it.\n\n4K gaming is non-existent. I have a R9 295X2 and struggled to get a stable 40fps on most games. That is, if the game even supported more than 1 GPU. So I mostly got a choppy 4K @ 30hz - 40hz.\n\n4K television/media content is a joke. Upscaling? Whatever. Console gaming? Impossible. TV? Not for another 5+ years. So a 4K HDTV is basically a huge scam that does nothing, 4K monitors are for gaming at really low resolutions, and the extra workspace 4K gives is negated by the eye strain and incredibly small text you will get. I have amazing vision, but even I struggled at 4K. Up the Windows DPI? Then why even have 4K? On the Samsung, anything but the native resolution (4K) looked horrendous. Unplayable, unusable. Even in games. Worst $700 I ever spent. Not even worth $300. That cheap monoprice IPS kicked that $700 Samsung UD590's butt in ALL WAYS!\n\nThe 55\" 4K HDTV was cheap enough to justify keeping it for TV watching, and maybe as a second/third monitor when they finally release a HDMI 2.0 to DP1.2 adapter. I use that to watch movies, which is awesome because this monitor's stand is amazing and the monitor as a whole is very easy to move. (I keep it infront of the TV- all on my computer desk, and just move it to a stand when I want to watch TV.)\n\nVery disappointed, until...\n\n----------------\nMy Review\n-----------------\nIn comes the Asus MG279Q.\n\nOne of the first 144hz IPS panels.\n\nI just hate TN panels. The color is so bad compared to IPS, and the viewing angle is horrific. But TN's usually have amazing response time and high refresh rates.\n\nThis Asus MG279Q brings with it the best of both worlds. Amazing color and viewing angle of IPS, combined with the gaming response time and high refresh rate- all alongside FreeSync. Something I've read may become the new big thing in future monitors.\n\nSkyrim, even when it dips to 35-40fps, feels a lot smoother with this monitor than with others. It just is. I don't know if that's the response time / not as much ghosting or the FreeSync. It is just smoother. When it goes above 60fps though? Oh my goodness that is awesome.\n\nEven surfing the internet is better @ 90hz or 144hz. The mouse on the desktop is smoother. It's an amazing experience.\n\nI have read online that once you go high refresh rate, you can't ever go back. This is true for me as it was for them.\n\n4K was a huge letdown and content & hardware are years behind it. With this monitor, you still get an amazing picture (1440p) but you get even better a smoothly animated, silky smooth gaming experience- even when you dip!\n\nWith 4K, you struggle to get 30-40fps. With 1440p, you always get 40+, and on most games 60+. Although it isn't easy to get 80+ on many games. (That is why IMO it's fine that FreeSync caps at 90hz with this monitor).\n\nEven better, this monitor has tons of features that turn out to be awesome. It has ADC which automatically calibrated the monitor when I hooked up my X-Rite i1Display Pro to it. I didn't have to manually do ANYTHING! So awesome!\n---------\nTIP\n---------\nAccording to a detailed tech review, it is best to set the \"Trace Free\" option to 80, not the default 60.\nhttp://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/asus_mg279q.htm\n\n-----\nMy Settings, After Professional Calibration\n-------\n(RACING MODE)\nBrightness: 30\nContrast: 73\nR: 100\nG: 94\nB: 91\nTraceFree: 80\nFreeSync: On (Have not tested if this is best ON or if 144hz is any different. It is noticeable on the desktop with the mouse 90hz vs 144hz, but it's not that noticeable.\n\n-------\nMy System - Finally Satisfied\n-------\nASUS MG279Q\nCalibrated by: X-Rite's i1 Display Pro\nR9 295X2\n\nThe GPU pushes Skyrim w/ 1440p @ 90hz, and with all my graphical mods I get no lower than 35fps, average 55fps, and indoors 90+ fps. (Although Skyrim is CPU bound, so that is partially why I get some of the lower fps). No other game so far has given me low framerates. With 4K, the 295X2 wasn't enough. With 1440p, it is. The refresh rate limit of 90hz when using FreeSync is fine, because few games go above 90fps even with a R9 295X2.\n\nThe color calibrator is not required, but IMO if you're already spending this much money (295X2, $600 monitor, etc.) and you have the money- it is worthwhile to get the absolute best experience. Although that tech article I linked to can give you some good settings (but every monitor will be different).", "I just received my MG279Q yesterday so as you read my review keep in mind that it is based only on unboxing and the first few hours of use. However, my first impressions of this display are extremely positive.\n\nMy home PC sees heavy gaming use in addition to normal web-browsing duties, and in addition I sometimes work from home as a freelance social media specialist. I have been looking (and looking ,and looking) for a new monitor since last fall (2014) when my HP Pavilion 27xi died completely with no warning (nice looking screen, short on bells and whistles, unacceptably short lifespan). I was torn by indecision. If I wanted to get another 27\" monitor, should I prioritize 1440p resolution (since my old display was only 1080p), or game-oriented optimizations like refresh rate and response time? On the other hand, I had always wanted a triple-head setup, but would it be worth the hassle of constantly adjusting my settings for games that don't play nicely with three screens? On the \"other other hand,\" I was intrigued by the ultrawide (21:9) displays hitting the market and saw real benefit to them for productivity and multi-tasking.\n\nI hemmed and hawed over all these considerations for months, \"making do\" in the meantime with a 24\" Asus display I had reclaimed from my fiancee (who wasn't using it with her laptop anyway because her desk was always a mes... love you sweetheart). In the end I settled on the MG279Q, even though it was at the upper end of my price range, because it appeared to offer the best balance of size, display quality, performance, and quality-of-life features. So far I feel my estimation of this display has been completely validated.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ First and most importantly: the screen is beautifully crisp, smooth, and vibrant! Coming back to an IPS panel after months using a TN display, it's immediately noticeable how much more vivid colors are.\n+ No excessive/noticeable backlight bleed (at least on the display I got).\n+ No dead pixels (again, at least on mine).\n+ USB ports for my mouse and keyboard are nice for reducing the cable rat's nest behind my desk.\n+ Mini-joystick on the back is very nice for navigating the OSD settings menus.\n+ Height and swivel adjustment is smooth and easy.\n+ Stand arm allows you a convenient place to store your headphones on the back of the monitor out of the way when not in use.\n\nNEUTRALS:\n\n+/- Physical design is nothing to write home about. It's a dark gray color rather than the black like most monitors (and as it may appear to be in some photos), with spare red accents (branding on the base, cable-management bracket on the back, etc). There is no in-your-face branding or garish decoration, but aside from its size the monitor won't attract attention at first glance just for its physical characteristics. It looks like a monitor, and it looks like it was designed for function rather than aesthetics. I will say the bezels are nice and slim, it's not an \"edge-to-edge\" screen but the bezels are slim enough that they don't make the monitor seem bulkier.\n+/- Base of the stand takes up quite a lot of area on your desk. This is to be expected as it has a heavy panel to balance and the monitor isn't wobbly when in use but it's something to consider if desk space is at a premium for you. Of course you could always use a VESA mount.\n+/- Speakers are adequate and that's all. Thin and tinny sounding. OK for web browsing and watching some YouTube videos but not really up to the task for immersive music listening or gaming. I use headphones for that sort of thing so for me this is not a big deal, and what do you expect from monitor speakers anyway? If a monitor has speakers at all, they're all going to sound like this (odd ducks like the HP Envy 32\" aside).\n\nCONS:\n\n- Had to fiddle with settings to correct sleep behavior... at first the monitor wouldn't properly wake up - it would lose the signal from the mini display port and stop providing power to the mouse and keyboard through its USB ports. Changing the monitor settings to charge USB devices on standby and making a couple of adjustments to Windows' power options seems to have corrected this but it was disconcerting the first time it happened, when I had to disconnect and then reconnect the Mini DisplayPort cable to get the monitor to respond.\n\nOne thing I can't comment on is the monitor's AMD FreeSync capability. I have an nVidia card in my system (Asus STRIX GTX970) which is of course incompatible with FreeSync. I considered the Asus ROG Swift (PG278Q), which is compatible with G-Sync, nVidia's proprietary system for accomplishing the same thing as FreeSync. However, I was put off by the high price tag of the Swift and the many reviews reporting serious build quality and panel quality issues. I have never had a serious problem with screen tearing while gaming and so neither G-Sync nor FreeSync are particularly compelling features to me.\n\nTo me, unless you have your heart set on being able to utilize G-Sync, this display is a much better value than the ROG Swift. It features a very similar design, similar performance specs in most/all respects, the same Asus gaming features, more connectivity options, and perhaps most importantly an IPS panel versus the Swift's TN panel. Furthermore, while the MG279Q hasn't been on the market as long and it may be too soon to tell, so far the MG279Q doesn't appear to suffer from the same thing of QA problems which have plagued the Swift. Now consider the fact that all of this comes at a price tag which is, depending on which retailers you compare, about $100 less than the Swift, and in my opinion the MG279Q is a \"no-brainer\" superior choice... again, UNLESS G-Sync is a critical consideration for you. For anybody with an AMD card, or for whom variable refresh rate technology isn't a major consideration, the MG279Q is an outstanding choice for a large, high-performance gaming monitor.", "There is not much more I can say about the monitor than what has been said by the many positive reviews this monitor has received be it on Amazon or other hardware websites, but I will share my own experience with the monitor for the short time I owned it before returning it.\n\nI used the monitor for about one week and had stepped up from my faithful ASUS VG248QE (144Hz 1ms TN panel). The MG279Q picture looks far, far better of course being an IPS display vs. a TN display. The colors are fantastic out of the box on the \"racing\" mode, but I did use a TFT ICC profile to get what I felt was the best picture I could with minimal effort. I tested the monitor with the other preset modes, but I found that the racing mode did provide the best color.\nI really, really like the rear/side bezel buttons and \"joystick\" for menu navigation. My previous VG248QE has buttons on the bottom and the icons for those buttons are impossible to see making navigation a little frustrating. The joystick on the MG279Q just \"feels right\" for menu navigation, perhaps because myself and the gaming audience is used to joystick navigation? From what I understand, this layout is similar to ASUS' popular ROG SWIFT display.\nThe monitor itself just feels solid. The stand base is huge, and the stand mechanism is sturdy and it all just feels like a quality product. The stand base also has a nice style to it and feels very minimal and non-invasive despite its size.\nI really like the color of the unit itself - it's a dark charcoal grayish color and it is a nice change from the glossy black monitors that many of us have used for years.\nA little cable routing clip is included which is a very nice touch, and ASUS actually includes a DisplayPort and HDMI cable in the box! (mini display port to display port cable)\nNo dead pixels at all!\n\nI am running a Sapphire R9 290 Tri-X and DID get a chance to take advantage of FreeSync, and mostly played FFXIV and Heroes of the Storm, both of which looked fantastic at 1440P with all settings maxed out. Performance was great and FreeSync is really cool. I set the monitor to 90Hz in the catalyst control center & windows display preferences, turned on FreeSync in the monitor's OSD, and maxed out all game settings in FFXIV while in-game preferences were set to 90Hz as well. I did not experience any tearing or stuttering whatsoever and noticed that my system had me around an average of 45-53 FPS, so slightly under 60 but feeling like I was playing at 60. While many people are expressing concern over the FreeSync range, it really does take trying it out to be able to say \"That actually looks and feels pretty good.\"\n\nYou may be wondering why I returned the product, and here are my two reasons why: First, when flipping modes (say, from DisplayPort to HDMI, or from 90Hz to 144Hz), my monitor would create a vertical line of static-looking distortion on the left side and I would have to reseat my selected input's cable for it to go away. I tested it with an HDMI cable I have been using for quite some time & the issue persisted. It was not a MAJOR deal, but I wasn't comfortable with it having dropped $600 on the monitor.\nSecond, and this touches on my review title, is input lag. I mentioned another product review early on in my own review here, and they do reference that the MG279Q has moderate input lag at all modes aside from 144Hz. I did not think this was going to be a big deal, but for me it turned out to be. Coming from the VG248QE which has very low input lag, I could not help but notice it and feel it when playing games or even on the desktop in the 90Hz FreeSync compatible refresh mode. I flipped the setting to 144Hz and the input lag was nearly eliminated and felt great, but I really bought the display with FreeSync in mind knowing most of my games will not be running at 144Hz since I am not planning on upgrading my R9 290 any time soon. I wasn't some input lag expert or anything prior to using this, but the input lag that the MG279Q was just a little too high for me.\n\nI would still recommend this monitor to most users. Again, I am a meticulous user and had trouble dealing with the input lag, but aside from that & my strange intermittent distortion issue there was nothing else I consider negative about this product. I played the panel lottery as we all do when buying big monitors on the internet and got a panel that had a minor issue, but was free of dead pixels and LCD anomalies. I highly recommend the product to users who do not mind moderate input lag, or simply don't care, or to users who are just going to be driving it at 144Hz anyways. It looks great, it feels like quality, and if you're running an AMD setup already it's probably the best FreeSync monitor out there right now.", "--Summary--\n\nOverall I'm disappointed in Asus's quality control: this could have been an excellent monitor, but it is marred by multiple QC defects. My unit came with 1 dead pixel (in the upper left corner), about 7 partially occluded pixels (randomly dispersed in the lower middle right), unacceptably high amount of back-light bleed from the bottom right and left edges of the screen (about 2in in from each corner), and most annoyingly of all, it intermittently goes dead (black screen of death) for no apparent reason (I've never seen this problem and I've been an IT guy for around 10 years). Assuming I got a bad unit, which I hope is the case, most of these issues shouldn't be of concern, however, after reading through most of the reviews here on Amazon I'm amazed at how poor Asus's QC has been with the MG279Q monitor: Many other people have gotten monitors with similar problems (bad pixels, partially occluded pixels (AKA \"dust\" in between panel layers), and bad back-light bleed) leading one to believe that the chances of getting a good MG279Q monitor are slim to none. I really wanted this purchase to work out, but sadly, with all the defects and the low likely hood of getting a good unit I'll probably be going with a different model or brand. Seriously, for a $600 monitor the above problems are unacceptable.\n\nThe Good the Bad and the Ugly/Mediocre: Highlights of both\n\n--The Good--\nMedium sized 2560x1440 resolution (1080p isn't very HiRes, let's not kid ourselves), excellent for both movies and games. Has a crisp and bright display, feels good on the eyes. Color representation appears top notch for a non-professional monitor. IPS panel has excellent viewing angle range, as well as top class refresh rate, up to 144Hz! Has FreeSync 35-90Hz capability, making gaming a more enjoyable experience. Option to turn power LED off (a 1000 thanks to whoever implemented that in the OSD)! Excellent display mount with good height adjustment and rotational capabilities. All plastic parts have a matte finish to avoid annoying reflections. Screen has excellent anti-glare coating, doesn't make it too grainy and not mirror like either. Display has excellent input options: mini DP, full-sized DP, HDMI x2 and a USB 3.0 hub. Comes with one of each type of cable: mDP-DP, HDMI v1.4, and USB 3.0. Final assembly is a snap, you simply attach the screen/arm to the base and turn a hand screw and your done. Over all these features would add to a potential 4-5 star purchase (assuming back-light bleed is minimal and there are no bad pixels).\n\n--The Bad--\nMonitor will intermittently go black during use for reasons probably related to the epicycles of the inferior planets. I've yet to try a different connection between my video card and the display, but as it stands, using the mDP-DP cable to connect the monitor to my PC (which has a 7800 AMD video card) the screen will randomly go black for arbitrary amounts of time--sometimes a few seconds sometimes minutes or longer. Soft power cycling the monitor off/on via the power button doesn't help, unplugging the display-port cable and reinserting it seems to possibly help but not every time. It's frustrating to say the least, especially when I'm working on spreadsheets or about to print something or even while watching a movie it just randomly happens. I hope this isn't a common issue with this panel, if not, may god have mercy on any who dare buy this monitor. (As a heads up, all cables are firmly inserted, I'm using Win8.1, have the latest AMD video driver, there is no strain on the video cable between the monitor and the PC, I've set the refresh rate to 60Hz (as there isn't a real point for 144Hz with my older system), FreeSync is disabled on the monitor, monitor is set to DP v1.2)\n\n--The Ugly/Medicore--\nThe display has one dead pixel near the top left of the panel, not really in the way but I do notice it when sitting back in my chair and it nags at me considering I paid $600 for what I thought would be a pretty awesome monitor. The next issue is more of a WTF problem, how do you get partially occluded pixels? Dirt in the layers of the panel? I don't really know, but what I do know is that this monitor has at least 7 splotches that are not on the surface of the screen which are partially blocking light from the pixels behind the derbies imbedded in the panel layers. It's something you will notice when looking very closely but when sitting back in your chair its not that big of a deal, but it nags at you when you see them. Finally back-light bleed--the mortal enemy of all human kind. The pixel issues above, while annoying are certainly a notch below the annoyance of the back-light bleed that's emitted from the bottom left and right edges of the display. Its enough that you can't help but be distracted when watching a movie that doesn't quite fill the screen. A real buzz kill.\n\n--Score--\nThree Stars, decent but not great. QC problems eat at your conscience; eliminate the back-lighting and weird pixel discrepancies and you would have yourself a solid 4.5 star monitor (FreeSync range really needs to be extended, both lower and to the max refresh of the display to really deserve a full 5 stars).\n\n---Conclusion--\nYou are probably better off buying a different monitor, at least until Asus gets their assembly and QC problems ironed out. Otherwise you risk having to play Russian roulette on getting a decent panel. (Note: my monitor was purchased on the 16th of July 2015 and delivered on the 24th after Amazon got a fresh stock of MG279Q panels. So it doesn't seem like Asus has even noticed or accepted that the outlined issues, that I and other reviews have pointed out, either exist or should be of concern to them.)", "First off, I am not someone who write reviews often but the arduous experience of trying to find a quality monitor for gaming, work, and photography much harder than it should be for spending this much money.\n\nTLDR: I tried 4 IPS monitors and this is the one I ended up keeping. I tried two ASUS MG279Q WQHDs, one Acer XF270HU 27-inch WQHD and finally the NIXEUS 27' Edge\n\nAbout me: I am a software developer who's hobbies are gaming and photography. Which means I look at a screen all day every day. It means I understand technology, demand performance, and need visual accuracy.\n\nWhy IPS: There are really two main technologies out right now IPS and TN. There are variations of these technologies. The Nixeus uses AHVA which is a variation of IPS panel. TN is arguably better for gaming because of the minuscule response time (usually 1ms) and lack of ghosting. Low response time = no input lag, No ghosting = no blur or jitter when you move around in the game. I chose an IPS variant because as a photographer I want 100% or near 100% sRGB spectrum. The main issue I have with IPS panels is the slower response time ~10ms (even if they say 5ms is closer to 10ms) and \"IPS GLOW\" I HATE IPS GLOW. This is an unavoidable characteristic (not a flaw) of IPS screens.\n\nMonitor 1: ASUS MG279Q\nOf the monitors, this was the best looking visually. The colors were vibrant, accurate and pleasing to look at. The screens menu system was the best of the three, and I like the build quality the most out of the three. Why did I return two of them? Backlight bleed. and a lot of it. IPS glow is often mistaken for backlight bleed. Backlight bleed will cast a yellow hue over the edges of the screen while IPS glow affects the luminance of the area, making the edges of the screen seem slightly brighter and almost a blue hue. I can deal with a little backlight bleed but it bleed through a good 8 inches from the lower right corner and about 3 inches from the upper right.\n\nMonitor 2: ASUS MG279Q\nThis monitor was pretty much the exact same as the first. less backlight bleed but still present in the same locations.\n\nMonitor 3: Acer XF270HU 27-inch WQHD\nMore money, better screen right? not really. This screen had NO backlight bleed, but the IPS glow was very strong. Which I was willing to deal with but I had a few issues with the screen. 1) the box arrived with the box obviously opened (Acer security tape cut and box all beaten up) 2) the screen didn't have as much punch when it came to the colors. 3) the monitor had difficulties syncing with free sync. The free sync wasn't as smooth as the Asus screen, and some games like destiny would only sync up to 60 fps, where the Asus would sync up to 72 fps (these were settings just in Destiny 2). So I ultimately returned it.\n\nMonitor 3: Nixeus 27' Edge\nNow I had my reservations with Nixeus. I had previously owned a Nixeus and wasn't that impressed. The speakers were tinny, the colors were meh, and the black were horrible and \"crushed\", that was the old Nixeus. The new Edge looks GREAT. The colors aren't as good as the Asus but on par with the Acer. The menu system is meh, and the stand is a bit ... silly. (It looks like one of Batman's throwing stars). But there was ZERO blacklight bleed, and the IPS glow was the best managed of the three screens I tried. The screen synced at 144hz (freeSync) in Destiny two and all implementations of freeSync must not be created equal because I was taken aback by how much smoother and crisp the image was in games compared to the other two monitors (each around $100+ more than the Nixeus).\n\nBack To Back Comparison:\nASUS MG279Q: Best overall picture, best menu structure, and great build quality. Best features (I loved its in-game features including the sharpening boost) I would recommend for someone that was only using the screen in a bright room and who cares about the best color representation.\nColor: 5\nStand: 5\nFreeSync: 4 (smaller sync range)\nDark Room Viewing: 2\n\nAcer XF270HU 27-inch WQHD:\nGreat picture, ok menu structure, best speakers of the group. The stand was meh, the features were ok, and an overall a good performer, but since this screen was the MOST expensive of the group I was expected great. not 'OK' I would recommend for someone that is squeamish about going to an 'off-brand' like Nixeus, but wants a screen with decent quality control.\nColor: 4\nStand: 3\nFreeSync: 3 (smallest range of the group and it didn't work that well;\nDark Room Viewing: 3\n\nNixeus 27' Edge: Great picture (although requires calibration), worst speakers of the group, the stand is ok, the menu structure is not great, but the lack of blacklight bleed and controlled IPS glow is amazing. Top it off with a noticably smoother and crisper freeSync performance and you have a winner.\nColor: 4\nStand: 3\nFreeSync: 5\nDark Room Viewing: 4", "WOW!!! All I can say is this monitor is fantastic! The one I ordered from Amazon arrived today with a small bit of backlight bleed on the lower right corner. When I initially powered it on, it was not noticeable. But, once the monitor warmed up, I started to notice it while gaming. I tested the monitor with GTA V and it looks amazing!!! 2560 X 1440 is the sweet spot for gaming. This IPS monitor made the game look superb! It is a freesync monitor, but I did not buy it for that. I am using twin GTX 970s on a FX 8350 CPU (in the event I end up getting two AMD Fury X cards). I am sending this one back for a replacement (I'm hoping the replacement will be flawless, if not, at least tolerable for my needs/wants) as Amazon returns are superb! I am blaming ASUS for this one....the crazy thing is, the seal on the box (the one you have to peel off before you open the box) says \"Quality Control Passed\". Evidently, ASUS did not do a good job. So, here is my list of pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n2560 X 1440 looks great!!!!\nRan GTA V very smoothly; no tearing (almost felt like Gsync)\n144hz and IPS!\nGreat viewing angles (not that anyone would game from staring at the sides of it rather than the center)\nGives ROG Swift a run for its money! (in my opinion)\nThe menu toggle joystick (easy for navigating the OSD)\nColors are mouthwatering and jaw dropping\n\nCons:\nbacklight bleed in the bottom right corner (This monitor would have been PERFECT if it wasn't for that)\nQuality Control Passed Sticker (this was placed on the box stating it passed QC, however, the backlight bleed in the corner is was very noticeable)\n\nOverall, I am not giving up on this monitor. I think the price is fair for what you get. If my next one is bad, I am going to ask for a refund and get the Acer 144Hz IPS Gsync monitor instead. ASUS could have a winner on their hands with this one if they decide to do a Gsync variant and address the backlight bleed issues. But I love this monitor!\n\nUPDATE: 7/7/15\nI just received my replacement monitor from Amazon. Amazon shipped this thing out very fast. The first monitor I purchased from them is enroute. Regarding the second monitor....WOW!!!! No dead pixels, absolutely NO backlight bleed and the IPS glow is Very Very minimal. I played the Asus lottery (I wasn't giving up on this monitor) and ended up getting a good one. Once I properly calibrated the monitor, it is great! If this monitor ended up like the first one or worse, I was going to give up. Thank you Amazon for helping me get my replacement. This is by far the best monitor for the money. You can't beat the 144hz IPS panel for 599.99. I am coming from the Acer TN Gsync panel which has a 1ms response time. This panel has a 4ms response time and I don't even notice the difference. Consider this monitor, if you get one that does not function, Amazon will work with you. The returns are quick. I am stationed overseas and I got this monitor in 5 days.\nPlease see my photo below. There is absolutely no bleed and very very very little glow. In fact, you can almost see reflection in the screen.", "I've been looking for a good replacement for my older NEC 2490WUXi and I'd like to keep using an IPS panel as I frequently have to do photo editing and color reproduction is important. I will be keeping two newer 2490WUXi2 monitors in a triple monitor configuration. I already have the tools to calibrate this monitor and I've been waiting for a good high refresh rate panel since CRTs went away. That currently limits my choices to this model and a similar model from Acer. The actual panel is from the same manufacturer in both so I've been trying the cheaper Acer option. Unfortunately all the monitors I've received so far have been bad out of the box.\n\nMonitor 1 - 07/29/15:\nThe first monitor had an odd black smudge roughly 4x4 pixels in size. I've never seen this style of defect in a monitor before so I can't say for sure what the cause is but it looks like there may have been some grease smeared inside the panel during manufacturing. I've taken a picture of the issue and attached it to this review. It's somewhat difficult to see at this scale but if you take a step back and look at it from a distance you can see the smudge. You can also see lit partial-pixels under and around it which shows that the actual pixels are functioning correctly.\n\nMonitor 2 - 07/30/15:\nFailed back light segment. I've attached a picture to show what this one looked like.\n\nMonitor 3 - 08/01/15:\nOver 8 black smudges ranging from roughly 2x2 to 4x5 pixels in size. These covered the center and entire right side of the screen.\n\nMonitor 4 - 08/05/15:\nTwo black smudges both 2x2 in size. If one of them wasn't right off of center I would have considered keeping this one as the second smudge was in the very upper left corner and not totally obvious.\n\nMonitor 5 - 08/08/15:\nThe first screen with an actual dead pixel in the lower right. There are still multiples smudges elsewhere on the panel: 3 in the lower left about 2x2 in size and one in the upper right also 2x2 in size.\n\nMonitor 6 - 08/13/15:\nMore smudged areas. No actual black areas on this panel, but there are noticeable gray smudges in all four corners.\n\nMonitor 7 - 08/17/15:\nMore dead/smudged areas. Some of these look like standard dead pixels while others look more like panel contamination. I've attached a new picture of one of the darker areas. While none of them are in the center of the screen there is one in the upper left, two in the bottom left, and one in the lower right. The date on this monitor is May 2015. I had been forgetting to grab that info for the prior panels but I'll try to note it on future ones until I get one that doesn't have any glaring problems.\n\nMonitor 8 - 08/20/15:\nPanel date May 2015. No smudges! One dead blue subpixel near the center bottom which I was willing to live with until I tried to do color calibration. No matter what I did I would constantly get extremely different settings when I probed the corners of the monitor. Dimming the lights in the room and displaying a black image showed a serious yellow discoloration in the lower right corner. This doesn't look like normal IPS glow; I've attached a picture of this one next to one of my older NEC's and while it has more overall glow it's at least uniform. Maybe #9 will be a winner?\n\nMonitor 9 - 08/22/15:\nPanel date Apr 2015. Nope. Multiple smudges right in the center of the screen. I stopped counting at 7 but they're everywhere on this one. Most 2x2 to 4x4 pixels in size, although there are some random 'dust' spots that are blocking one subpixel in places as well. Amusingly this box had a 'QC Passed' sticker where the ASUS tape normally is.\n\nMonitor 10 - 09/06/15:\nPanel date May 2015. Large grease blob 3x4 pixels in size left of center. Three smaller grease blobs 2x2 in size along the left side of the screen. Couple of other 'dust' spots scattered randomly on the screen. Back-light bleed on this one seems to be as bad as #8.\n\nMonitor 11 - 09/23/15:\nPanel date May 2015. Dead pixel blob 2x4 in size slightly below center plus a smaller 2x2 blob two inches below the first.\n\nAs far as the parts of the monitors that ARE working go: back light bleed seems to be similar or less than my other NEC IPS monitors (except for monitor #8) and color reproduction looks good. Screen brightness appears to be fairly even. Even with these issues I think these will eventually be solid monitors once the panel problems get cleared up.", "I loved the excellent quality of the monitor. I am by no means an expert, but the color and brightness were top notch compared to other monitors I've tested. Nothing beats IPS when it comes to rich colors and after all, we're looking at our games and game worlds so don't you want to see the most vibrant colors and environments? After using TN, VA, and IPS, I will never purchase another VA or TN monitor and their crappy washed out colors. I think most gamers don't really know what they are missing. Really the only reason you should be playing on a TN is if you are a competitive e-Sports titles player and have to have that super low GtG response time. Otherwise go IPS!\nAnyway, this thing: the stand is very sturdy and well built with no wobbling like I've gotten with other monitors. I liked the ergonomics of it, didn't need a VESA mount or monitor stand, was able to get it in the perfect position with it's included stand and adjustment features.\nNow to the con, which is a big one for me. The monitor is now 2 year old tech but it remains a full priced $500 monitor. At this price point, it's not a good value for the money and especially due to this: it's free sync range is only active in 45-90hz. That doesn't mean you can set the monitor to 144hz and it will kick in at that range. If you do, it will disable Freesync. That mean you have to set your 144hz monitor to 75 or 90. Dumb, right? What is the point of dropping $500 on a 2k 144hz monitor that can't use Freesync above 90hz? I don't see it. Sure, if your GPU can peg 2k in the newest AAA games at over 100-120 FPS consistently, mabye you don't need Freesync anyway. But what about those time when you get FPS dips down into the 50-60s? There is a hack for it to extend the range. I tried it, and could not tell if the hack worked or not and was very uncomfortable having to hack a monitor that costs $500. There are a couple other 2K 144hz IPS monitors out there that don't have that Freesync limitation and are also less expensive, so I couldn't justify the expense and returned this monitor. I considered giving four stars, but I don't see why ASUS couldn't update this model with a full Freesync range up to 144hz like Acer has...so three it is.", "PROS:\nIPS\n2560 x 1440\nFreesync (Can play GTA V at ultra now without getting mad because I was going under 60fps)\nGreat Colors before and after calibration (Not much calibration was needed)\nExpensive when compared to other 1440p monitors, but when comparing to G-Sync equivalent Acer XB270HU, this thing is a bargain!\n\nNEUTRAL:\n35 - 90 Hz Freesync panel limitation (Who the hell is going to run a game at 1440p at 144Hz anyways)\n\nCONS:\nMedium amount of back light bleed (Not obtrusive when gaming, can be noticed while watching movies)\nOne dead pixel (Bottom of screen)\n\nConclusion:\nThis is my second MG279Q. First one was from Newegg and that had a cluster of dead pixels right in the center. Newegg's return policy isn't the greatest, so I just returned it and bought it from Amazon. All I can say is, QC issues. This thing is near perfect, besides the mediocre back light bleed and the stuck pixel. I will not be returning the monitor as the dead pixel is on the bottom of the screen, and I barley see it without focusing on it. Back light bleed is definitely not the worst, and it can be dealt with. I do not feel the need to keep RMAing and try to cherry pick the best monitor I receive. Playing this monitor roulette game is not what I want to do. I just wished that the premium I paid would at least make ASUS do a better job at quality control. All in all, I'm just going to enjoy the monitor as it is, and ignore all the flaws it has.\n\nUpdate 8/20/2015:\nWell I knocked a star for a very good reason. The dead pixel and back light bleed slowly crept up to me and I realized, that for $600 dollars, I should be getting my moneys worth. And as a student with no job, this makes my financial situation worse than it is. So It seems like after 4 monitors (1 from Newegg, 3 from Amazon), they all had some type of issue, whether it was stuck pixels, dead pixels, back light bleed, and weird (but rare) issues with freesync drivers, such as black screens and weird static lines on the sides of the monitor. I really want to like this monitor. I plan on getting the Asus MG278Q if the price is right, but if not, I will be coming back to this monitor as production issues die down. Also, that QC Passed sticker should be removed from every box, as receiving a defective monitor is very common, and it isn't a nice thing to reassure people that it passed QC even though most monitors are apparently fault in some way. So, in the end, if you like costing amazon a lot of money by playing monitor roulette, this monitor is definitely for you.", "This really is a beautiful monitor. I came from a cheap acer 1080p TN panel from black friday 2010. I hate myself for not buying a IPS panel sooner. It is a world of difference from color accuracy and size. The acer actually had me believing light beige with a pink hue was white.\n\nI love how bright this screen gets which is how I noticed the first monitor I received has a few dead pixels. By a few I mean 8, one of which is near proximity to the center of my screen. The IPS glow was not too bad on a full black screen just a little on top and bottom left corner.\n\nFor the price I paid I wanted the perfect monitor so I went through the RMA process. It was quick easy and I got to use the first monitor while the new one was being shipped. It was during this time is when I really fell in love with the monitor. Movies looked great. Games played and looked amazing. I can't imagine going back to my TN panel.\nThe replacement monitor arrived fast via 2 day shipping. The packaging was open but had a \"QC\" sticker on it, my first monitor was just open with no sticker. The replacement monitor had 0 dead or stuck pixels but that glow though. No seriously I have never seen a monitor with this much IPS glow in person. There were 5 or 6 glow points on the top and bottom of the screen with the ones in the middle being the worse. They were so bad that they washed out colors on a normal screen and on the black screen the glows on the top nearly touched the ones on the bottom. The replacement was a total piece of crap. Which brought me to my first issue with amazon return process.\nI couldn't return the replacement. It is not as easy to return a replacement as it was to return the original. If I called or emailed I probably could have got it working but what if the next replacement was no good as well? I'd have to repeat the same email/phone call. The replacement had a so called \"quality control\" sticker and it was far worse than the first one. This is the very reason I never bought a Korean panel because it was a gamble on what you get.\n\nI ended up keeping the original monitor. Only time i noticed the dead pixels was on a full white screen while searching for them.\n\nIf you are planning on buying this monitor you have to decide what you are willing to settle on. All the features and the potential of this monitor at the price making it a very attractive buy. It's a gamble though but at least you can get your money back.", "Bought two for sw development; they're perfect. I am going to buy a 3rd one. Replacing three hd monitors and literaly tripling + my on screen workspace with just two of these right now. If you work with software that has many panes open to show a lot of info, this is a must have. Be forewarned, uhd will spoil you forever for 1080 monitors. Looking at my hd monitor next to this one, I had to triple check that my hd screen resolution wasn't accidentally set at 800x600. That's what it seemed like next to this uhd resolution. Wow. Literally, you can fit 4 hd displays into just one of these monitors; it's 4 times as much screen space because the pixel density is 4x 1080pi.\n\nAs far as quality goes, Asus is my go to component manufacturer. I have their motherboards, graphics cards (Stix 480 8 gig) and now monitors. In my experience all their stuff is solid and trouble free and these are no different. I bought mine in 3/17 if that info is useful to anyone.\n\nThese will change the way you work- what more can you expect from a component?. I chose buying these right now over upgrading my cpu to AMD Ryzen because, really, 99.99% of the time my computer IS my keyboard mouse and monitors; those are what I am actually interacting with and what makes the biggest difference to me. I'll save the move to Ryzen for a couple years down the road. I'll still have these then.\n\nOne more thing is if you get these you might want to upgrade your mousepad to a hard surface, high precision one. My high precision cloth gaming mousepad was not permitting me to make friction free very small mouse movements which I now need because there are so many more (4x) pixels in the same space.\n\nCorsair Gaming MM400 mousepad:\nhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B0149QBN0G/ref=twister_B01MUZ4ZFY?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1\n\nMy rig.

After weeks of research I was finally able to settle on this monitor because asking for good color gamut, fast response and refresh time went upwards of $700. And for this price, it\u2019s an absolute steal.\n\nThe monitor settings needed some adjusting for it to not strain my eyes after a few hours. After some fiddling I settled on 18 brightness, 60 contrast, user mode for color display at 100R 96G 96B at racing mode. The colors are still slightly off compared to Mac computers. However it also has an sRGB mode which I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s the same as Mac displays since I don\u2019t have it side to side to compare. The sRGB mode however locks you out of adjusting brightness and anything color related. Maybe they thought that they had it calibrated at its best?\n\nAdobe photoshop and illustrator have very small icons which make it hard to see.

Forhode who have better eyesight, you\u2019ll be able to see the words just fine, but like I said before, it takes some getting used to.\n\nI looked more into it to see if I could adjust the display but it seems like it\u2019s more of an Adobe issue rather than the monitor\u2019s. Perhaps is the screen size/resolution that Adobe hasn't figures out. I\u2019m not entirely sure.\n\nAs for casual gaming, I\u2019ve only ever played games on my brother\u2019s desktop so after I made my own, I\u2019ve bought only Overwatch and so far it has not disappointed me.

This review is not for you. For the rest of you, read on. The ASUS 24-inch 4K UHD FreeSync Gaming Monitor [MG24UQ] IPS just arrived. My purpose in buying it was to build a PC based 4K streaming PC. This purchase is the beginning of building that system. Many cord cutters do not realize that to stream 4K from Netflix or Amazon, all of the components must have Ultra High Bandwidth Copy Protection 2.2 (UHCP 2.2) support built into the device. This includes TV\u2019s, receivers, soundbars, graphics cards, and operating systems. I wanted to test this with the ASUS MG24UQ. The MG24UQ has UHCP 2.2 support, but will it really stream 4K? I am happy to say that it does. It not only streams 4K, It has mouth gaping visuals. When I went to YouTube and played NASA\u2019s 4K video of a sunspot, my mouth literally dropped open. I have seen the Sun like only a few have. I then streamed Sense8 from Netfilx. It was absolutely gorgeous. I put this together by using the Roku Premiere+ Streaming Media Player with the MG24UQ. Both are UHCP 2.2 devices. That means you can stream Netflix, Amazon and YouTube and everything else 4K that Roku offers. The way I did it was through Sling for $35/month. Now you are streaming 4K on a 24\u201d TV/monitor. If you are 24\u201d away from the monitor, you get that movie theatre experience. Trust me this works for a personal 4K theatre. The Roku package offers a headphone set that plugs into the remote eliminating the tinny sound of the monitor. Give it a shot. You will not be sorry. $269 for the monitor. $89 for the Roku premium +. You are streaming 4K.", "the difference from this monitor from my old 27 inch IPS 59hz display is outstandingly amazing. The color is on point for me from what I can tell (and I have used it briefly for amatuer artistry) And obviously the 144hz just makes this so much smoother of an experience. Im not joking when I say that I truly believe it made me play just that little bit better! As silly as that must sound haha. Overall I like the features and asthetics of the monitor, the bezel is alittle thick for my tastes, but thats mostly a nit pick when compared to the drastic increase in quality this monitor has. Not to mention the small touches and bells and whistles for gamers, like the built in cross hair that can be toggled on to borderline cheat in games with hardcore type modes, or in games like Escape from Tarkov (this is a feature I know is sought out for among that particular community) And altho I dont normally use those features often, they are nice.\n\nThe monitor also features built in speakers which sound okay, they arnt the worst thing ever, but I wont be using them anytime I dont have too. I have used them for playing playstation 4 games on my monitor, and they worked fine enough, but they left something to be desired for sure, and I will be planning to try to find some alternative in the future for my console games, and of course will continue to use my headset for my pc games.", "After multiple attempts at the lottery I finally came out on top. This monitor is gorgeous but not without some minor flaws. First, this monitor will have susceptible IPS glow, it's a flaw in all IPS panels. Mine has some glow on the right corners but you will not see it unless you view it from a close side angle. Second, this monitor does have bleed but to a certain extend, your millage may vary because my first three monitors has unacceptable bleed from corners to corners but my fourth replacement came with very little bleed on the lower right corner and a bit on the middle top left. I used the \"tap, massage\" method in attempting to remove the bleed and it did work after a few days of gaming. After a week, the bleed are almost non-existent. For those who plan to buy the monitor for freesync, don't be disgrunted about the bleed because you can make it go away after continuous use and applying the tap method, just look it up. Freesync works very well on non-FPS game, and if you have a beast of a card like I do with the R9 295X2, you should limit your FPS to 90FPS on AMD Catalyst with freesync and overdrive enabled. After enabling these options, gameplay will be buttery smooth with no tearing. Although many people complain about the high end of 90FPS being too low for a freesync monitor, I think it's a sweet spot consider it's difficult to differentiate when gaming on 90FPS vs 144FPS in non-FPS games. If you are an AMD user with a freesync compatible card, GET THIS MONITOR NOW. Stay away from the BenQ TN 144Hz Freesync panel as I did tried both these monitors in store and the BenQ just doesn't have the vibrant color and great viewing angle that the MG279Q has.", "Pros:\n\n-1440p screen looks fantastic.\n-IPS colors enhance the image quality in both photos and games.\n-27 Inch monitor makes watching movies and steaming nicer and easier to see.\n-Frame seems sturdy and durable.\n-Joy stick function is weird but it makes navigating the menu so much easier when you get used to it.\n-Monitor comes off the stock stand so you can attach it to 3rd party mounts.\n\nCons:\n\n-5+ dead pixels. Asus has really dropped the ball on QC but lucky for me they are spread out and you can't even see them unless you hunt them down.\n-Minor IPS bleed on bottom right. Not really a con since its barley noticeable but for a 575-650$ product I would expect better.\n-When monitor goes to sleep, it disconnects from your computer. This means that if you have a 2nd or 3 monitor set up it will make that the primary monitor. Not so much a con as it is annoying.\n\nFinal thoughts:\n\nI upgraded from an Asus VG248Q so this monitor was naturally on my list for a replacement. I play both League of Legends and Heroes of the Storm and the 1ms (VG248Q) vs 4ms (MG279Q) is not noticeable at all. I also play some FPS games and again there is not noticeable difference in response times. I have to give Asus props for attempting a 144hz IPS 1440p monitor with a 4ms response time. However I am one of the semi-lucky ones who got a functional unit. I am not returning it since I can live with the cons and do not want to risk getting a worse off unit. I am also a bit disappointed in Asus. I have been a fan of theirs for many years and this is the first time I was disappointed with one of their products. I would recommend this monitor to anyone but be careful. There is risk and there is reward. I will update if anything should change.", "I went through FOUR other monitors and this is my fifth and sixth. Tried two Pixios and two Acers and they all had problems (dead pixels, scrambled video, losing signal). I sucked it up and put a little more money into this Asus and guess what? DEAD PIXEL. THIS SHOULD NOT BE HAPPENING WITH $400-$550 MONITORS! Just got the second Asus and so far, so good.\n\nAside from that, I was happy with it. Most of the presets gave me weird contrast ghosting and really brought out the compression artifacting in compressed images and I was getting irritated that I couldn't get rid of it. Found these settings on reddit and they really do seem to give me the best results:\n\nGame Visual: Cinema Mode (unlocks all settings, has best contrast)\nBlue Light Filter: 0 (after changing you might need to set \"mode\" back to Cinema)\n\nColor:\n- Brightness: 75 (your preference, 80 was looking a bit harsh after a while in my dim room.)\n- Contrast: 80\n- Saturation: 46\n- Skin Tone: Natural\n- Color temp: user. [R: 100] [G: 96] [B: 96]\n\nImage:\n- Sharpness: 50\n- TraceFree: 80\n- VividPixel: 0\n- ASCR: off\n\nMenu navigation is the best I've seen on any monitor thanks to the joystick-like interface. Screen is bright and vibrant, lighting is very even - I don't see any splotches or wierd light bleed.", "I decided to opt-into buying this monitor after struggling to figure out what I wanted. I play video games as a hobby but I'm looking into graphic design for employment, so picture quality was something I was keen on getting right the first time. I've never owned something aside from a hand me down $100 TN 60Hz monitor before this.\n\nPros:\n- Fantastic picture\n- No dead pixels out of the box\n- Large display size\n- Ships with MiniDisplay Port to Display Port cable, Power Cable, HDMI Cable, USB 3.0 Data Cable (MiniDisplay cable easily supports the refresh rate.)\n\nCons:\n-Just be aware that lower to mid rigs might need to have their game graphics adjusted if you're used to rendering images on a 1080p resolution.\n- Large footprint and back panel, just in case you have a thin desk or monitor riser.\n\nOther Notes:\n- Noticing a motion blur between everything I do now? Not sure if it's the monitor myself, or if it's my eyes trying to adjust to how fast things move on the screen. (i.e. moving windows and scroll menus around)\n- Speakers aren't superb in quality but that's not something to really be worried about.\n\nOverall, highly recommended if you're willing to accept the larger price. Might be even more worth it on a sale. Very pleased with this purchase. Putting this review out there for new monitor buyers.", "In response to some discussion I have seen about this monitor, I want to say that this is a review of my satisfaction level with the monitor, and is not based on a comparison of the merits of FreeSync vs. G-Sync. I have AMD cards, so G-Sync is completely irrelevant to me. Yes, it would be nice if FreeSync covered a broader range of frames, but I think the manufacturer made the right call in extending the bottom end of the range rather than the top end. It definitely seems to me that you need it more at lower frame rates. Also keep in mind FreeSync adds no cost to the monitor, so it is pretty much gravy when added to the other features.\n\nI love being able to run games at 144hz in 1440p, and I love being able to use FreeSync with games that run at lower frame rates between 35-90hz. My one niggle is that the refresh rate would default to 60hz rather than 90hz when engaging FreeSync, until I saw that I could set it to 90hz manually from the Catalyst Control Center. It seems like the monitor should default to the max when engaging FreeSync mode. In the end I decided this was not worth taking off a star, since it was easy to remedy.\n\nIn addition to the faster refresh rates and FreeSync, I notice substantially less lag than I had with my previous 1440p IPS monitors, particularly when attaining the higher frame rates. I have especially noticed a difference in FPS games."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010FVYZPE", "title": "KitchenAid KSMC895OB 8-Quart Commercial Countertop Mixer with Bowl-Guard, 10-Speed, Gear-Driven, Onyx Black", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71A3w9SDXoL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "1,635 ratings", "description": "8-Qt Bowl-Lift Stand Mixer, stainless steel bowl guard,1.3HP high efficiency DC motor, all-metal precise gear design, (includes: 8-quart brushed stainless steel bowl with J-style handle, stainless steel 11-wire elliptical whip, burnished stainless steel flat beater and stainless steel spiral dough hook), NSF Certified, 2-year warranty from KitchenAid, Onyx Black", "reviews": ["We had a smaller kitchen aid mixer and it horrible.

So we searched and researched and stumbled upon this commercial KitchenAid. What a great find!\n\nThis mixer is similar in size to the Professional 600 we also considered. It is almost 17\u201d tall, so it fits perfectly under the cabinet (and it looks fantastic too, orange cord included - tucked away in the back). And because it doesn\u2019t tilt, I can keep it in one position and never move it (the Hamilton - a tilt head model - we needed to take out every time as we couldn\u2019t tilt it under the cabinet). Also, the 8qt bowl is big (or at least that's my impression after switching from a 4.5qt one), but it is mostly tall. It is so tall in fact that there are issues adding ingredients - when we use this bowl we always have to lower it to add ingredients. It seems (from what I read) that the pouring shield from the Professional 600 6qt bowl fits this unit. But we never bought the shield - instead, to mitigate this issue we purchased the KitchenAid  KSMC5QBOWL  5qt bowl for about 40 bucks) and that one is perfect for our everyday mixing needs.\n\nWe love the fact that all attachments are stainless steel. Very good quality too and NSF rated for restaurant use. They are BIG, and solid! We switched most of our small appliances and cookware to stainless, and this is one very important reason we chose this KitchenAid unit (the Hamilton aluminum-coated attachments started to chip after just a few uses). We have tried all attachments and all performed very well. But we needed to adjust the bowl height to get them to properly scrape the edges. There is one attachment that we considered (the KitchenAid  KAFE7L ) but didn\u2019t yet really feel the need for it.\n\nUsing it is a pleasure! This thing is a beast. Nothing can stop it! It has so much torque! And it is do quiet too. It features a slow start - when it gets to the speed selected all you hear is a very quiet motor driving the gear drive (I cannot really explain it; it just sounds like a well-built, solid machinery). It mixes anything we through at it - pizza dough, play dough, paleo (sticky) dough, panettone dough, eggs, etc. - with so much ease. It also drives that meat grinder without any strain - almost as if nothing is there.\n\nThe lift-bowl is a bit more inconvenient than the tilt-head model (as my Hamilton was) but the torque on this puppy would have probably torn that hinge apart. To see the true difference in the motor design please refer to the pictures I uploaded - the KSM8990 has direct drive, and the entire motor unit is actually cheaper to replace (about 50 bucks) than replacing all parts that could go wrong in the other 2 models.\n\nIt is one of my best appliances (I try to purchase commercial quality as often as I can - I also have the Waring  WFP14SC , the Waring  MX1200XTX , the Weston  08-0801-W , among others) and I reach for it every time I have the chance.\n\nAll in all, highly recommended!", "I just received my KitchenAid 8 qt. Stand Mixer. I have previously owned one 5.5 qt., and two 6 qt. KitchenAid Stand Mixers. After purchasing the 5.5 qt., I bought the first 6 qt. because I needed a larger capacity bowl for the dozens of cookies I make in one session. Subsequently, a more powerful 6 qt. was released and I bought that one because the cookie dough I make is pretty thick. I gave the 1st 6 qt. to my daughter. However, the thick cookie dough continued to make even the new mixer work really hard. Although, it did get the job done. When I saw that a 7 qt. 1.3 hp was being produced, I decided to upgrade again. However, right before I ordered it, I came across the commercial NSF 8 qt. 1.3 hp.. So, I ordered that one instead. I'm keeping the 6 qt. for smaller jobs and for when I need to use 2 mixers at the same time for different projects.\nI have so far set the mixer up and run the motor for over 20 minutes to ensure it works before I start making the large batches of cookies later this week. Well, it works great. The 6 qt. was louder and it also wobbled across the counter as it mixed and I didn't feel comfortable leaving it running without being very close by at all times. That was a hassle as I could not easily accomplish other cooking tasks at the same time. This machine does not wobble at all. And, after 20 minutes the motor became warm but not hot like with the 6 qt.. I will not know for sure how it handles the thick dough until later this week. But, I expect no problems.\nI did not find an issue with snapping the bowl in place, like some others have reported. But, I do have a lower counter that I use for my mixer and food processor that gives me more leverage than if they were at normal counter height. Yes, the edge of the bowl is not rolled like the 6 qt.. That's because it's National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) Certified and it prevents food from getting trapped in the roll and then allowing bacteria to grow (I looked it up :) ). The edge is not sharp either. Another big benefit that I like is that the beater, whip and dough hook are all stainless steel. This is unlike the aluminum ones that come with the smaller KitchenAid mixers.\nAlso, the pouring shield from my 6 qt. works with this machine. It's also great that the 6 qt. bowls, beaters, ice cream maker and all my other attachments fit (e.g. pasta maker, juicer, food processer, meat grinder, etc.). Additionally, it's a bit taller than the 6 qt.. But, it's not much wider and the KitchenAid cover I used on the 6 qt. fits just fine. I love the Empire Red color too (even with the orange cord). I think this will be the last mixer I will ever have to buy - unless I decide to open my dream bakery at which time I will probably have to go with a Hobart. Thanks KitchenAid!\n\nUpdate: I have now made over 30 dozen cookies and this machine works without hesitation. It did wobble a bit; but, nothing like the smaller KitchenAid machines.", "I\u2019ve used a tilt head standard Kitchenaid mixer for 20+ years. With a cookie business, making more than one batch at a time was a struggle with the tilt head. With this commercial 8 qt, it\u2019s a breeze. I make 4 batches at a time now with ease. Excellent machine. The only thing I have an issue with is aligning the \u2018bump\u2019 on the back of the bowl with the \u2018bump holder\u201d as I call it, is pretty difficult. I never get it on the first try, which is annoying. It should be easier to get the bowl in securely. Other than that slight design flaw, I\u2019m giving this a rave review. Plus, the nickel pearl is gorgeous. She\u2019s a pretty powerhouse.", "The Michigan winters can be long and a bit dreary with the lack of natural sunlight, so during the winter, I put my KitchenAid to work! There\u2019s something about home cooking that makes being hold up in the house, seem like a cozy vacation. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I use my KitchenAid all year long, but especially during \u201ccooking making weather\u201d. I stepped up my game this year to the 8 qt commercial mixer and could not be more pleased with my purchase! Doubling a cookie recipe without overwhelming the bowl was enough to make the 8qt more appealing, but add in the increased motor size and a few attachments and this mixer turns into a legitimate hobby that everyone can enjoy. Bored during the winter? Get yourself a KitchenAid and open the door to scratch cooking, without the work of hand kneading and mixing. Want to be able to share your creations? Invest in this mixer and you\u2019ll find yourself doubling and quadrupling recipes with ease, so you can share some, sell some or freeze for future use, while cleaning the kitchen just once! I\u2019m in love!", "I bought this as an upgrade to my \"mini\" artisan kitchen aid. This model claims to make make loaves of bread, cookie dough batches, etc... I tried increasing my standard 2 loaf bread dough, but the machine couldn't handle it. Rather disappointing. While it is sturdy and does the job well, it certainly can't handle double sized recipes even with the larger bowl capacity.", "The mixer is just like it was described. I was tentative because some of the reviews talked about thinking they were buying new mixers but when the one they ordered showed up, it was obvious it wasn\u2019t new. SO I called customer service BEFORE I purchased anything. I was transferred to the woman that handles the KitchenAid appliances. Not only was she knowledgeable, she was sweet and answered all of my dumb questions before purchasing.\n\nI say dumb not because I\u2019m new to KitchenAid. I wanted to first and foremost understand how they were able to sell the same mixer that was on the KitchenAid site for so much less. I came to find out that because of the volume they buy, they can offer such good prices. She entertained my questions about returns, warranty, shipping, motor size and how to read the codes on the site to determine the differences in mixers.\n\nNot new to KitchenAid at all. I have a 5 Qt mixer that after 14 years, had some gear problems. I\u2019m going to get it fixed and use it as a spare, but because I make double and triple batches of cookies, I needed a bigger bowl. This mixer is great. It came brand spankin\u2019 new in the box, not opened and not touched by anyone but me (LOL).\n\nAs I mentioned previously, I was a tad bit concerned because of all the reviews that talked about motor noises when the machine was first turned on. Especiallly because this mixer is a bit pricy. I heald my breath, turned it on and the mixer is quiet as a mouse. No abnormal noises and works flawlessly. I was also reassured because of the great time I had talking with customer service BEFORE buying, that I was sure if I had a problem, returning, exchanging or getting my money back wouldn\u2019t be a problem.\n\nDON\u201dT hesitate to do business with this company. The product is just as described and no problems. Lastly, I\u2019m a firm believer that if customer service will spend 10-15 minutes on the phone with you before you buy anything, there\u2019s a high probability that when you do purchase, if something goes wrong, you\u2019ll get the same level of service or more", "I am extremely pleased with this mixer! This our 4th KitchenAid mixer in 25 years. All of the others are still running like new - we just needed more. We wanted a heavier model for making various types of dough. Dough is the toughest thing for a mixer to mix. The commercial models have a completely redesigned transmission. I don't know exactly how the transmission has changed internally as they are now sealed and part of the motor assembly but it is now a right angle configuration. Previous models employed several gears which were prone to more rapid wear especially when making larger amounts of dough. It appears the motor is now in direct alignment/coupled with the accessory connection. The entire transmission mechanism is much simpler with fewer moving parts and the result is a significantly quieter mixer. Another benefit of this new transmission design is no leakage of grease as the mixer ages. Previous models after many years would begin to leak grease because the grease would break down and separate. This required periodic overhaul of the gear case where the old grease needed to be completely wiped out and replaced with fresh food grade grease.\n\nThe mixer when running at high speed is very smooth. It depends on which attachment is being used and how well balanced it is. We purchased additional 8 quart and 5 quart \"J\" handle bowls designed for this mixer. The 5 quart is great for making small batches. The only thing is the bowl guard doesn't cover the gap between the top of the 5 quart bowl and the bowl guard because the dimension between the attachment tabs and the top of the bowl is much shorter. We also purchased 1 additional paddle, dough hook and wire whip available here on Amazon so we could prep or clean while another batch is in the mixer.\n\nOne other major improvement is the wire whisk/whip. The design uses 11 wires configured more densely in a rectangular profile. We noticed that egg whites whipped significant faster vs our Pro 6. I think it is because the wires are positioned non-symmetrically so they are always whipping through in a different area of the ingredient being whipped.\n\nEverything that could possibly come into contact with food is made of stainless steel including the planetary and bowl guard. The attachments are significantly heavier especially the dough hook. The dough hook is not balanced and the manual warns to not run the mixer beyond speed 2. I ran a test and the mixer will wobble across the counter if it is run at high speed with the dough hook attached. The bowl guard is a great safety feature and extremely easy and non-intrusive to use. We especially like it when small kids are near the mixer when it is running. It will prevent their fingers getting inside where this stronger horsepower mixer would likely cause significant injury.", "It is great for the large batches of cookies I make. Very happy to upgrade", "I just want to know who tf approved the cord to be orange??? It\u2019s so ugly. It could\u2019ve been white, red, black even! But freaking orange ??? It ruins the whole thing. But overall it functions well. They could work on the noise level though.", "This mixer is next level! I\u2019ve had two other kitchen Aid mixers, they work just perfectly, but man\u2026. This new mixer is powerful. We\u2019ve mainly used it for Pizza dough. Our Artisan Mixer had trouble with heavy doughs, but not this one. Mixes and makes heavy doughs without a hassle. Well worth it.", "I took it out of the box, inspected it\u2026and put it back in the box.\n\u201cI LOVE IT\u201d\nThick Mixer is going to be put to good use this Summer when The family Reunions begin.\nI have a smaller Kitchen Aid one that cost $499, but it\u2019s nothing in size compared to this one.\nI COOK A LOT AND WE HAVE A LARGE FAMILY.\n\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffc", "very heavy duty and the paddle, wisk, and dough hook are made of very heavy stainless steel. the two year \"no questions ask\" warranty make the price well worth it. I bought this one for my daughter. I have had mine for 4 years. I make sourdough artisan bread. The commercial with the orange cord is superior to the professional series.", "This is the third line of KitchenAid mixers I've owned now.\nFirst was an Artisan which I killed (replaced under warranty when the motor burned out). My sister has the replacement since she uses it only a couple/few times a year.\nSecond was the \"Professional\" 600 mixer which was having major issues after making bread for a few months. It had sat idle for a few years, so outside of warranty. I repacked the gears with fresh grease (the correct stuff) and that allowed it to limp along for a few more months. I make 6 batches of whole wheat bread each month (all 100% stoneground whole wheat flour in the batch). Loaf comes out to ~3# when complete.\nI purchased this mixer since I couldn't afford to get a Hobart countertop mixer (N50). So far it's holding up well. The motor is a lot quieter than either of the other two lines I've had (the 'pro' made horrible noises). Each batch of bread I make gets a 10 minute kneading cycle (after the ingredients are mixed completely). Which means it runs for about 12-13 minutes for each batch. The housing over the motor, and gears, is still at room temperature even after that. With the other mixer, it was very warm or hot.\nI do like the all stainless attachments on this one, compared with the others. The 8 quart bowl is overkill for me, but it's better than going smaller than the 6 quart for the previous mixer.\n\nI really do wish that KitchenAid mixers were the same quality they were back in the early years. My mother has one from the late 70's and it's still going strong. The housing is vented where the motor is, which helps. These days it seems that you have to go to their 'commercial' line before you get something approaching that quality level.", "I cannot believe the difference. I had a 450 that died after 22 years almost to the day. I make a lot of breads and dough, and that is very hard on the machine. I can make 3 or 4 doughs at a time and this little workhorse kneeds the dough like it is nothing! Great purchase for us!", "This is my fourth KitchenAid stand mixer. The first three were home models. This is my first commercial unit. I can't say enough about the BIG 8 quart mixing bowl, it is a game changer for big batch jobs. The attachments are a solid material compared to the home units (much heavier grade metal). It runs so quiet and the \"stir\" speed is a great addition to the features. The bowl handle is perfect. I searched a lot of online reviews for commercial stand mixers before I bought this mixer, and KA always came in first place in all categories time after time. This a great value for the money. I did purchase the extended warranty just for an added protection given the value of the unit."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B010M8ZBTY", "title": "Garden of Life Probiotics for Women and Men, Dr. Formulated Once Daily Ultra 90 Billion Adult Probiotic for Digestive Health, Immune System Support, Acidophilus, Prebiotics, 30 Vegetarian Capsules", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/615SfP0J0NL._AC_SX569_.jpg", "ratings": "1,010 ratings", "description": "For adults looking for a highly potent probiotic to support digestive, colon and immune system health every day, Dr. David Perlmutter created Once Daily Ultra.

OF COURSE, IF we tire of this delightful fare, we can always slip in one of her very delightful PB & J \"do's\" to clear our palates as we await the next turkey course which is generally served with the ever reliable side of good old American potato chips!!!\nSO NOW IT IS TIME TO TALK ABOUT THE UNIMAGINALLY USEFULFUL/PROBLEM ELIMINATING (WAR SOLVING) MINI DISH DRAINER AND TRAY!\n\nME: THE OLD FASHIONED/SPOILED ROTTEN/PRINCESS TYPE MOM who firmly believes that the correct place for all dirty dishes is the DISH WASHER which is loaded with used dishes over a period of time, until the dish washer is full (you may correctly read \"filled to the gills\" with dishes propped \"just so\" so that every conceivable dirty dish is crammed in (there are no clean dishes remaining in the cupboard and I either run the highly overloaded dish washer, or we use Paper Plates (God Forbid), or I buy a new set of dishes...\n\nI AM VERY FORTUNATE in that my daughter, who is a Missionary in The Mexican Baja, is able to visit me at least once every two years, and sometimes, she even gets to fly in every year. You see, she creates a REALLY \"MEAN\" TURKEY SANDWICH piled high with a mountain of sweet Onions and Thick Slices of Firm Avacado and, like any good Mom, I take Full Advantage of these skills when she is here.\nTHUS, THE NEED FOR THE MINI DISH DRAINER AND TRAY. YOU SEE, I am the old fashioned Mom, and I cling to my belief, that if there are dirty dishes, as one expects to find if one has just dined on THE W0RLD'S BEST TURKEY SANDWICH ON DARK RYE COMPLIMENTED WITH A \"TRUE AMERICAN\" SIDE OF CHIPS, then one expects to find a Dishwasher to handle all \"used dishes\" and utensils used in the preparation of this meal! My super organized Child, though now an adult, prefers the Mini Dish Drainer so that aLL Prep items plus dishes are washed and draining at the end of the meal. She is already back chatting to me about her need for a New Computer within just minutes of that last bit of turkey finding its niche in my stomach. Ahhhh....whatever happened to the idea of a meal Settling in one's stomach which brings to mind the thought of a brief nap accompanying that \"Settling\"! Well, no time for drifting off...There is a Review to finish up here!!!\nPROS: MY HIGHLY ORGANIZED \"TIME'S A'WASTIN' DAUGHTER absolutely loves this Mini Dish Drainer and Tray; in fact, she liked it so well, that I purchased a second one so that she could have one to use in the small Baja home which she and her husband share with the many Rescued dogs and Salvaged cats with with whom they gladly share their warm and loving, lively abode! (The two of them share their very strong feeling that no animal should go unloved or unwanted....DO NOT EVEN MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF ABUSE....WOE TO PERSON WHO MIGHT ENTERTAIN THE SLIGHTEST IDEA OF PROVIDING LESS THAN OPTIMUM CARE FOR ANY ANIMAL OVER WHOM THEY HAVE AUTHORITY....MY DAUGHTER'S HUSBAND IS ONE OF THOSE RARE PEOPLE WHO MUST REGISTER HIS HANDS AS A LETHAL WEAPON....before he became a Christian, he was given early, and very thorough training, in the art of killing. Today, if you do him an injustice, he will quickly turn the other cheek. BUT, should you cause hurt to ANY animal, those hands may quickly become your worst enemy. The Mexican People are only now learning that animals have feelings, just as people do, plus they are a part of God's creation and \"He keeps His eye on the sparrow\" and any other part of His creation....So treat ANY AND ALL CREATED BEINGS WITH RESPECT, KINDNESS AND LOVE!!!\nKrys and Carlo are both very Big on Caring for Your animals and they both work for Rescue Services in their home towns plus the larger area in which they live. I am very Proud of both of them for doing this.\nWELL THAT WAS A VERY LONG ASIDE (OR RABBIT TRAIL) BUT I AM HAPPY TO HAVE GOTTEN IT IN!! THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE!\n\nKrys loves the Mini Dish Drainer she uses while at my house because 1. It let's her make very efficient use of the short amount of time she has here in the States. She makes her sandwiches, then washes the utensils. At the end of this very uncomplicated meal, she makes short work of the dishes and is back talking with me in just a few minutes. I live in the Phoenix metro area, so air drying for the dishes is a no brainer and is DONE in just a few minutes no matter the season or time of day. When it it is time for her to leave, she just snaps the tray onto the drainer and stores it away on the top shelf of the pantry along with the coffee maker she uses. I have ample storage space so storing her \"special items\" is not an issue. As I said earlier, Krys liked this Minis Dish Drainer abd Tray si well that I got her one to use in her home.There, Saving space IS an issue, so this drainer is just right for her. Once the dishes are dry, she snaps the tray over the drainer. This keeps it clean even though she opens the doors to the house so the animals may run in and out to their heart's content until the day is over and everyone is bedded down as the Master of the Home sees fit!!! Then supper is served to all (well, this is before bed time), and out comes the drainer which serves its purpose as dishes are washed and put away, then it is packed away again, out of the way, until it is time for the next meal! (Zena, the Most spoiled dog of all....and master of the cats as well...will certainly notify us when her tummy is empty again!)\nNow I do not tell Krys this because she thinks the drainer is all hers' and that I am a total dishwasher maven! However, once her precious little foot has hit the boarding dock of her plane, I take the Dish drainer down from its place in my pantry and put it to work for me, I use so few dishes these days and my dear little Mercy has gotten a bit chubby...too many treats and a bit too much of the FANCY FOOD!.So, she is on a slimming diet, while I just use a dish or two here and there, The poor dishwasher frequently goes empty, while I USE THAT LOVELY DISH DRAINER myself. What a great find!!\nI do use and, prefer, the white. My kitchen just is not set up for black. However, I have two neighbors who have Black in their kitchens and I have told both of them of the Mini Drainer and both of them have gotten the item in black. Both are very pleased with their purchase.\nAnd, whichever color you should chose, black or white, I know that you two will be thrilled with your brilliance on cutting back and being ever so organized,. So, chose which color you like and put this in your cart or just buy with one click. It is so sensible and you will be thrilled with your newfound brilliance at using this. So, buy on. And do hurry. Your child, or spouse, or friend, or book, or even the TV set, awaits. Push the button and join the rest of us who are liberated dish dryers!!!! AND< DO HURRY! MERCY AND ME!", "I had been using fabric drying matts for the non-dishwasher safe dishes/knives/utensils/pots/pans. They were ok until I realized that some items do not dry on the side that they lay on. The matts start to smell after a few days of use because they never dry between uses. I don't have much counter space so I was in the market for a small dish drying rack. This one turned out to be a little smaller than I anticipated, but it's actually perfect. It doesn't take up much space as it's about the size of an average shoe box, but it does fit a decent amount of items and is very sturdy. It's also easy to clean and there are no odors!

It is exactly what we wanted for this application, as we found a \"normal\" ceiling fixture with 2 LED bulbs was not providing adequate light.\n\nInstallation was typical for someone with good wiring skills/electrician training -- you need 3 arms to do it, but somehow where there's a will, there's a way. It's not a \"DIY\" project for a newbie (call an electrician if you lack that skillset). Please remember that the lightboard in this style of light cannot be replaced -- when it burns out in ten years, you have to replace the entire fixture.", "I initially purchased 4 of these LED lights at Home Depot over 2 years ago. The cost then was $30 each + tax. As an experiment, I used these 4 LED lights to replace two 4 foot fluorescent lights in my master closet. The LED brightness is the same as the fluorescent, but now there's no humming and no heat. The combined wattage of the 4 LED's is almost 50% less than the 2 fluorescent lights. All 4 of these LED lights are still working and look fantastic. I did have to create 3 more holes and the electrical wiring to support all 4 lights on the same circuit, but the results are totally worth it. As a result, I purchased 2 more of these lights from Amazon in March 2015. They were now cheaper on Amazon (i.e. $25 each) than at Home Depot. This time I experimented by replacing 2 recessed canned lights with 2 LED lights. This solved 5 problems I was having with my recessed canned lights.\n1. This LED light uses 90% less electricity than my canned light. This LED light uses 10 watts and my canned light uses 100 watts.\n2. The LED light generates no heat. A canned light is too hot to touch and generates unwanted heat in our hot summers.\n3. The LED light has no air leaks to the attic. My canned light was passing air from attic into the room really badly. I could actually feel it.\n4. The LED light allows me to put insulation on top of it. My canned lights are not allowed to have insulation touching them per electrical code.\n5. The LED light produces white daytime light (4000K). My canned light produces yellow light (2700K). I like daytime light much better.\nThis LED light solves so many problems for me that I'm going to replace the remaining 33 canned lights with these. The Amazon price for these is now $22.50 each. So I'll be buying a few more soon and gradually replace all those crappy canned lights.", "Solid, easy to install, and bright.", "Lithonia makes good fixtures. I have given this a three star because of the color quality. While I hesitated, it occurred to me that if this were my only LED lighting experience, I would be turned off from the genre, but I have some R30 Philips spots with actual white LEDS and are also temperature rated at 3000K.\n\nThis fixture has two different color LEDS, in circles, and evidently is an attempt to mix the colors to achieve a color the eye likes. It fails. I have it on a dimmer, and when you dim the array, it turns green, as the outer circle of LEDs dims, when you brighten it, it becomes more white looking but has a harshness, and I really don't like it. The other bulbs I mentioned are also on a dimmer and stay white the whole range.\n\nIt is unfortunate that Lithonia Lighting does not provide more information on their website about these fixtures and how they are actually lit, what sorts of LEDs are in use. The development of white LEDs was a big step, and when paying money for an LED fixture today, from a prominent lighting company like Lithonia Lighting, one should expect the latest and best technology not a color changing cheap fixture, the selling point of this fixture is, after all, the LEDs which do the lighting.\n\nThe other thing, which isn't really something that effected my score, is that the fixture is shallow, which is good, but one might also have an issue, if your box you are mounting this to is sticking out beyond the drywall, even 1/8th inch, the fixture will not seat against the ceiling. I had to rework the box in order to get it to seat below the ceiling material, so this is more of a cautionary. Most fixtures have quite a bit more room to play with on that issue, but like I said, it is nice looking being thinner.", "Well designed and very good looking fixture. Feels solid, looks great in person and handles damp locations. I'm not a huge fan of the 4000k color, but the 3000k temperature fixtures cost a fair amount more.\n\nInstallation: Mounts as one piece (not including the twist off shade), and uses the standard screw holes in the electrical box (no adapters needed). The only downside that I could point out is that one of the units I received had an internal lens mounted wrong, which meant the mounting holes in the metal body and the holes in the lens did not line up. I deducted a star for the bad QC.\n\nDurability: It comes with a foam gasket to seal the fixture to the ceiling, which I highly recommend. The internal cavity for the LED has a lens that is in addition to the twist-off frosted lens (plastic) that is pictured. I mounted mine in a location that does experience salty air, so I do have some concerns that over time, corrosion will occur on the internal components. Only time will tell.\n\nOverall it is a good fixture that is well designed and should hold up. I will update my review if there are any noteworthy changes.", "This is a great light for the price . Fits in a small area a d shines brightly. The seller, NW Distributors were great. They shipped much earlier than originally said and the light arrived 4-7 days before scheduled. Great company! Will use them again.", "Love these lights snd they are easy to install on dropped ceilings. The box fits in the ceiling with wires coming through to the light. The light back has fasteners that turn onto a plate. Amazing. We have 10 in bedroom and laundry room/ walk in closet.\nIn a regular ceiling you just need to make a small hole not the 6\u201d pot light holes. Like I said really easy snd less laborious. Also cut our electric quite a bit using LED lights as we installed them throughout the house.", "The unit ( I bought 3) is well made ( basically plastic with LED board). At first I thought I was going to have to send them back as the screws would not line up with my 3\" electrical box. What I had to do was purchase a 4\" optional bar ( at Hardware stores) which allowed me to put it in my 3\" box. This optional bar should be supplied with the product or at least instructions for installation.\nThe light is very bright and will light up a hallway, closet , or even small 10' x 10' rooms. I am going to purchase more for my upstairs hallways. This is a simple looking unit so if you are concerned with \"style\" this is not for you. I was looking to cut down on my wattage in the house. I also installed one in my wife's sewing room over her sewing machine. It replaced 3 mini 50 watt halogen spotlights I had in an overhead ceiling fixture. The Lithonia 7\" unit is at least as bright with a fraction of the wattage. The only problem will be longevity as you have to replace the whole unit if anything fails. Ask me in 3 years from now.", "Installed 4 of these 3 years ago to replace Lights of America 9W CF fixtures that never gave advertised 10,000HR service, in flush custom enclosures in my soffits that are very difficult to service.. These appear to be very well made. The non-wet location fixtures are remote photocell controlled, and give the same amount of light in temp. extremes from 15*F to 100*F. The fine print in the warranty states that the product will be considered defective if more than 15% of the individual LED's fail. (There are 47 LED's in this array). So far, after 3 years, while I've not removed the lenses to look at the arrays, there's not been any diminution of light that I can tell. I was not aware when I bought these, that a 2700K (warmer color) version is available...I'll be purchasing these when the remaining LoA-CF lights bite the dust. The 4000K units (cool white) are installed along the back of my house, but the warmer 2700K versions will look better in front and sides. In a couple of years I'll remove the lenses on these to see if any LED's have failed.", "These appear to be above-average quality fixtures that produce a clean, white light and illuminate a closet or other small room with no problem. However the mounting holes are spaced slightly too far apart to fit into the standard box - just enough to make it frustrating. There's about an 1/4 inch difference between spacing of the fixture keyholes, and spacing of the mounting box screws. To mount the fixture, the screws must be placed at an angle, one fit into the keyhole as it should be, and the other wrestled with and tightened against the fixture, not entirely in, nor completely out, of the keyhole. Both fixtures I purchased had the same spacing. Maybe I'm using odd boxes, but I doubt it as these are the same name-brand retail boxes I've used in all other projects. Forcing the screws to fit makes an easy job hard, but once fitted the fixture isn't going to fall down - it's just not a well-planned design, which is too bad for an otherwise nice light.\n\nUPDATE: On August 17, a little more than two months after being installed, I switched on the light to a cracking sound and cloud of black smoke. When I removed the fixture I found it had shorted out (for apparently no reason other than manufacturer defect), and in the process had even blackened parts of the electrical box and drywall. Fixture was in a closet corner, about eight feet up and thankfully the circuit breaker had tripped, or else I could have had a fire in a hard to reach location. Therefore I DO NOT recommend these fixtures, reducing my rating from four to two stars. Maybe this was a one-off bad example, but I had installed another, in a ceiling, at the same time as the closet, and am now keeping a fire extinguisher a few steps away. Two late for me to return but heads up to anyone considering the purchase.", "This is the 3rd Lithonia FMML 7 840 M6 LED light I have purchased. The first one is still working and did require a little workmanship to get it to fit correctly.\n\nThe first light was mounted in an under-stairs closet. The light, like all LED's, does not require any time to reach full luminescence (unlike the fluorescent lights it replaced). Next up was a closet light where I get dressed, it is now hung up there, but I still needed to remove a ground screw from a junction box cross-member to get it to fit flush to the ceiling.\n\nThe light itself looks simple to mount and is sturdy, the one under my stairs has lasted over a year without any issues. The one in the closes has been working fine for the past 3 weeks.\n\nMy 3rd light is waiting for another light to fail, but that won't take too long.", "This is a simple, effective LED lighting fixture. The design is dramatically minimalist ... kind of like a ceiling can light. Please note that the 3000K model provides a warmer colored light that the 4000K model. I have both and prefer the 3000K. Both are very bright. If you want a subtle light, this isn't it (without a dimmer). The fixture is reasonably easy to install if the ceiling box is large enough (4 inch). One of my two lights was installed in a standard sized ceiling electric box with no trouble. The other fixture was installed in a smaller than standard box, which made it very hard to match up the screw holes and difficult to tuck the wires into the box. The body of the fixture is metal and is very sturdy. The fixture seems to generate very little heat.", "This LED Mini Flush light looks well-made and was simple to install. I ordered the 3000K and 4000K units to determine which Color Temperature I preferred. I replaced the incandescent globe light in a closet and food pantry. I intend to purchase additional 4000K units and replace all of the globe lights in my closets.\nThe only downside was removing the plastic diffuser (lens cover) due to friction. It was very difficult to get the diffuser off the fixture. Before putting the diffuser back on, I applied a very thin layer of synthetic grease to the retaining grooves in the diffuser. These grooves contact plastic pins in the fixture to hold the diffuser in place. After applying the lubricant, the diffuser was easy to put on or remove.", "This light is strange when you are used to filament bulbs and CFLs. The way it's just lets off immediate light is weird. The way it is not user serviceable is weird. It's weird, and in a good way because I hope that I don't have to replace this ever. Installed in a 9' x 10' guest bedroom and it shines just enough light. If the room was any bigger I would go with bigger than the 7\" one. In general I would probably only use this light for small spaces like a stairwell, closet or small bathroom. The light is less omni-directional and rather shines down, not too much lighting up the ceiling (who needs that lit up though). It works and let's off some nice cool light without being overwhelming. It may sound like I don't like it but, installation was a breeze and it just takes some getting used to. I don't use it daily so I am not 100% used to it.", "The lights themselves are wonderful. I bought the bronze finish. Installation was simple, and the 3000k color temp was perfect. Now the bad... I noticed the plastic inner lens cover has stress cracks around the Allen screws. All four of the units I bought were the same. I happened to run across the same light fixture in the white finish at a local hardware store and decided to take a peek for comparison. I noticed the unit was in a different box and did not have the stress cracks around the screws. This makes me wonder about the lights being sold on Amazon, and if they are refurbished or truly authentic. The lights are wonderful otherwise, but I will be returning these and just ordering them from my local hardware store. I have included photos for comparison of what I bought off Amazon vs the unit in my local store.", "Best value fixture light I've found. First picked up a couple of these for a remodel on a Home Depot run. Installed these and loved them. All hardware included easy install and super bright. Immediately ordered 5 more off amazon. Works best in smaller areas installed in three bedrooms the largest is 12X16 which is a little two large for this light although was better than the two light fixture that was in room and uses 1/3 of power old fixture. Put some in dark hallways and now they light up like I put in a skylight. For kitchens I'd recommend clustering a couple together if putting in new wiring. Put for hallways, closets, small bedrooms, or basements these lights are great. Super white warm light very much like sunlight. Only downside when circuit burns out have to change entire fixture only other downside looks funny in larger rooms as very petite compared to other fixtures that put out simular light.", "I used this fixture to replace a failed soffit-mounted fixture on our front porch. Though the fixture is UL listed for \"damp locations\" I would be careful to use this outdoors only when the soffit-mounted is protected by a bulkhead or is out of the way of direct contact with rain.\n\nLike most Lithonia products, thus fixture is well made, with an aluminum body and tough lens.\n\nWhile it's not a \"decorative\" fixture it's attractive enough for indoor use and would be a great choice for closets and small utility rooms.\n\nWhen ordering, be sure to check the color temperature; I believe it's available in 3000K and 4000K. Use the 3000K for most places. The 4000K typically will look harsh.\n\nInstallation is very easy; no special wiring or devices are required. The fixture comes with plenty of wire and wire nuts and clear directions.", "This is the first\" Integrated Fixture\" I've used and I'm impressed by the solid case and internal components in it's construction. The quality overcame my main concern about a \"Failure-requires-replacement-fixture\" and surpasses many bulbed fixtures. I believe it's capable of providing the long life and low operating cost promised. We wanted two unobtrusive fixtures to replace those in our upstairs hallway which they do quite well, but I believe they would also suffice in a more utility location such as laundries, basements or grouped in kitchens. To me the 3000K light color appears close to an incandescent and is void of blue tones. All the parts necessary (2 screws and 3 wire nuts) were included and installation was leisurely completed in about ninety minutes for both. My only trivial challenge was unscrewing the plastic lens prior to installation which may have been easier with the aid of a flexible rubber jar lid gripper.", "Like other reviewers said, these lights are high-quality and easy to install, and the price is great. I used them to replace four big ugly fluorescent fixtures - you know the ones that are four by one foot boxes - in my son's room. With these new lights, the room looks so much bigger and the ceiling looks higher. I bought the 7-inch diameter 4000K lights. The 650 lumens is much brighter than the fluroescent lights they replaced and the color is much nicer. I originally thought of using can lights, but these give the illusion of can lights and are so much easier to install. One reviewer complained that they were set up for 4\" diameter boxes, but there are standard adapters (available at any hardware store) that would enable using them with 3\" boxes.", "I used these in two different locations in my home. The first one was over the kitchen sink. The electrical box over the sink is relatively close to the wall and limits the size of the fixture i can install. This lamp provided great lighting for doing dishes and working on the counters on both sides of the sink. But it doesn't provide a \"burning\" amount of light that hurts when you look at it. The second location is a hallway where I used one on each end. Overall I am very happy with these fixtures. No waiting for them to \"warm up\" like a CFL. NOTE; the spacing for the mounting screws on this lamp is 4\". You can get it to work with a 3.5\" box like I had but it will only have one screw holding it instead of two."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016PYZ5E0", "title": "Athena Large Silicone Menstrual Cup - Reusable Period Cups for Menstruation - Soft Comfortable & Environment Friendly - 12 Hour Organic Menstral Leak Protection & 15 Year Lifespan - Teen or Adult", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61VMIxT1l4L._AC_SX569_.jpg", "ratings": "8,722 ratings", "description": "Athena Large Silicone Menstrual Cup - Reusable Period Cups for Menstruation - Soft Comfortable & Environment Friendly - 12 Hour Organic Menstral Leak Protection & 15 Year Lifespan - Teen or Adult", "reviews": ["1) you must be comfortable touching yourself\n2) you must be comfortable getting a bit messy\n3) have a sink nearby\n4) relax!\n\nIf you are dry it can be a bit of a pain to get situated. There are a few ways to fold the cup to get it in and have it pop open but not all will work every time. I have had to insert and reinsert this a few times because the cup wouldn't open.\nI will push my vaginal walls out with my fingers in hopes to open space up enough for the cup to pop open - this works about 50% of the time.\nI will spin the cup to make sure nothing is pinched in still - this will cause leakage, and spinning helps prevent a vacuum seal which will make removal difficult.\n\nI insert and remove at home - where I have a squatty potty. This, I have found, helps everything immensely! I have tired to insert in the tub while squatting, sitting on a regular toilet in a public bathroom, and while standing with a foot up. Using the squatty potty is the easiest, followed by the tub.\n\nPublic bathroom is the worst due to fear of germs, dropping it, getting to a sink etc. This should not discourage anyone tho! I have had years and years of practice with tampons and have been using this for not even a year! Learning curve is there, but once you know how to get it in and get that down it just becomes practice.\n\nTips: you should NOT leak, if you are leaking it is not in right or you have the wrong size in. I am 32 with no children and use Cup 1 - I have purchased cup 2 to see what the difference should be. There are also different brands - if Diva doesn't work another style may help based on the depth of your cervix.\n\nThese cups wont be too big - the vagina is like an umbrella and will open to accommodate the 'girth'. You should not feel this at all (unless you kegel). Tampons you can sometimes feel - they are long, or are poking something in an odd angle, and they dry you out - this, you should not feel at all as the vagina itself has no nerve endings. However, if you are uncomfortable the stem could be to long, you could have a shallow cervix, or it is in at an odd angle and poking at the wrong angle. If so, take it out and re-insert.\n\nYou must fold this to insert it!\n\nTip 2: Before you insert clean yourself up, insert it, and clean yourself up again. This will help you figure out if you are leaking truely or it is just blood caught around the cup after insertion.\n\nTip 3: know your flow! I have overflowed this cup once - I noticed leaking and removed the cup; it was full!\nIf you have mucousy flow it will 'fall out' as you remove the cup. Be prepared!\n\nSanitize in boiling water after your cycle. This should last you YEARS!\n\nCOMPARISON:\n\nI purchased DivaCup Size 1 as my first menstrual cup. My cat has a rubber and now silicone fetish and proceeded to run off with it after I rinsed and put it on the sink before insertion.\nFigured I would buy some of the 'generic' or less expensive options, try them out and compare since DivaCup is on the pricer side.\n\nDivaCup $28 ish\nAnigan EvaCup 2/$35 dual pack\nAthena $20\nBlossom $18\n\nI chose the LARGE or Size 2 for each cup except my original Diva\nTo start all cups are the same in height - about 2.5\" high - you can see in the image with the yard stick\nI used each cup for a few days of my cycle, both light and heavier/mucusy flow. All worked perfectly, there were zero leaks\n\nDivaCup Size 1 is for prebirth/under 30. Size 2 is postbirth/over 30. The difference is the overall width through the entire cup, the difference is slight.\nDivaCup is by far my favorite except that the stem is open - that collects blood/fluid and it is difficult to clean. The wider stem does help it with removal but not all the time. It also only comes in clear, it will eventually discolor since blood stains.\n\nDivaCup has a moderate firmness and a thin edge. It is easy to fold and insert and opening is not an issue most of the time (suction is to blame the times it is difficult)\n\nBlossom Cup is my second favorite. It is visually similar to Diva, comes in funky colors which is a bonus for the staining. I got Red which is really a salmon color, should have chosen lime green. It has a thin edge just like Diva and is moderate in firmness. Easy to fold and insert, opening is not an issue. The body is slightly softer than Diva which may make removal difficult. I tend to grab the base just above the stem to remove.\n\nMy least favorites are a tie between EvaCup and Athena Cup for different reasons.\nAthena Cup is SOFT - very flimsy, the edge and body squeeze too easily and they just feel inadequate. The softness of the cup makes it hard to have the edges pop open inside you. These cups were the ones I had the most difficulty with.\nI just could not get these to open without a lot of internal manipulation (pushing the vaginal walls out to give the cup room to expand). I also had a tough time removing the cups - because they are so soft when you grab the body of the cup it squishes, I couldn't get a good grip. They do come in funky colors and I love the black and teal.\n\nEvaCup has the exact opposite problem, they are FIRM. The edge of Eva is thicker than Diva and the rest, not in width but in length down the cup. This edge is very firm, much firmer than the body which is firmer than Diva by far. This makes folding the cup much more difficult and insertion harder. It does help with popping the cup open but I found if I didn't have a really good firm grip on the cup it opened before I had it high enough. I could feel the cup and had to remove and reinsert a few times before it was high enough and in the right spot to do its job. Eva also comes in some funky colors - the two that came in the dual pack were pink and purple.\n\nOVERALL:\nAny of these will work, the best is to pick one and figure out what you like/dislike. Too firm, not firm enough, hard to remove?\nFirmer go with Eva, softer go with Athena, somewhere in the middle Diva or Blossom\nColors - go with anything but Diva", "I was apprehensive to try, as I\u2019d had a bad experience in the past with a disc. Am I glad I did! I tried it on day 2 of my period, which is always the heaviest, because I was going to be home. Used all day with no issues. Cleaned and left in overnight- again, no issues. The real test was the next day at work as a bartender moving around a lot. It sustained the whole day and then some. I am truly a believer. I got the small size, I am 38 and have never given birth.", "I mostly like it. I feel people might appreciate a more transparent review rather than this vague modesty I was provided prior to purchase.\nThe following logistics are important to consider:\n\nIt can me inconvenient to dump/clean the cup in a restroom where you are not within reach of the sink. Essentially the cup suctions up inside of you and you cannot simply pull the nipple end as implied (it will tug on your insides and hurt). You have to release it manually with a finger. Sticking your finger up inside to the rim and letting air get to it to release while simultaneously not spilling it or dropping it in the toilet. Now you are sitting on the toilet holding a small vile of blood.\n\nYou have to dump it in the toilet, stand up with your pants down and waddle over to the sink and rinse it off crossing your fingers that your flow isn't fast or heavy enough to dribble before you make it back to the toilet. Some say you dont have to rinse it, it only needs cleaned once a day so in a public setting this can be skipped. I feel thats icky, and messy. The cup needs to be folded in half before reinserted and if it isn't rinsed and you fold it you can squeeze blood up outside the cup & it will get all over your hands. This is almost a certainty if a clot is involved that is clinging to the inside of the cup. In a multi stall public restroom this is impossible to do without exposing yourself. In a private public restroom its possible but an inconvenience and risk of mess. At home, our sink is near the toilet so I can just reach over without having to stand up.\n\nThe cup does hold quite a bit of blood, and the only way to avoid the above is simply not removing it at all while in public. This is possible because of how much it holds, you do not need to empty it every time you go to the restroom, it wont overflow or get pushed out with a powerful pee stream or poo push. But it can shift around a bit, occasionally making you aware of the foreign object inside of you during normal activity, sometimes I can feel the nub at the opening of my vagina. It takes some practice to get it inserted just right consistently. So in the beginning I was removing and reinserting it quite a bit and that is when this public restroom stuff really became an issue. The more ive used it the less prevalent that problem is but occasionally I do feel its necessary to dump and clean it in a public restroom. For such cases I try to carry some baby wipes in my purse.\n\nA variation of this problem also occurs if sex is on the table for you. Pre-menstrual cup, I used tampons and if sexy time was about to happen I merely pulled my tampon out and tossed it in a nearby trash can or even just left it on top of my panties (to dispose of later) until the deed was done. With the cup there is no casually discarding of the device for spontaneous sex. It is to be treated like an explosive. Steadily and carefully removed and balanced to avoid spill. Any disruption can cause a terrible mess. So now before sex I have to access a restroom first, clean it and set it aside and then greet my visitor for action. This isn't difficult if a bathroom is readily available. It does become a bit of an issue if you are say camping, or on the road, or in water.\n\nIt seems for every negative there is an equal or greater positive. If you are traveling or in the outdoors, you dont have to deal with wrappers or accidentally getting your stash of tampons wet. No need to worry about finding a garbage can. You do not have to buy tampons, pads, or even panty liners. This thing does not leak. I have a super heavy flow and ive not experienced one iota of a leak. Once insertion is mastered it does feel very comfortable and shifts minimally and requires dumped only once or twice per day. There is no concern over being too dry. With tampons, even with a light tampon on a light day it can feel like shoving sand paper up inside you. The rubber is very smooth and kind to your delicate skin. There is zero concern about what size of tampon to use for the day or if you change it too soon you will be too dry to insert another. The one size fits all flow levels, thats a ginormous benefit.\n\nUltimately there are some inconveniences with using the cup, but the benefits are vast and I feel totally worth it!", "I just repurchased this cup since mine was a few years old and I was questioning if I should continue using it.\nI definitely needed a replacement after using my new one based on how much firmer and easier to insert it was!\nI love the cup life and it\u2019s so much more convenient for me. I got the black cup this time so I didn\u2019t have to look at the stains anymore as well.", "When the feminine world started going nuts over menstrual cups, I thought it sounded disgusting and unhygienic. I was so sure of it and thought all the hullabaloo and hyped interest was ridiculous and was certain the fascination with it would blow over soon enough. After a while, I started reading into it more, curious what had everyone so excited. Now, I have to say that this is possibly the best investment I have made for my feminine health in years.\n\nPrior to this investment, my periods were awful! If I used tampons, I suffered during my periods with intense chills, hot flash-like episodes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and occasional constipation with a constant urge to try and use the bathroom, and ALWAYS with the awful cramps that Midol hardly touched. If I used pads, my misery was generally limited to one or two days of the above, excluding the cramps which have been my friendly, once-a-month, week-long visitor for years. On top of that, because I bleed so heavily, I could not change my pad enough to feel at least \"clean\" and the smell always made me super self-conscious though I have never had anyone tell me they could smell anything. I often suffered from UTIs if I wore pads, no matter how hygienic and careful I was. (I'm a nurse, I am well aware how to clean my lady parts, thank you very much.)\n\nAfter doing some occasional reading about menstrual cups here and there, I decided \"what the Hell\" and threw caution to the wind to give it a try.\n\nI was surprised by the size of it when it came in the mail and balked at the idea of putting it up inside me, especially during my special time of the month. It seemed like a terrible idea and I thought it would cause some real discomfort. It was soft and flexible though, which is the only reason I gave it a try at all. I followed some advice I had read and didn't use the cup on the heaviest days of my period for the first month, just so I could get the hang of using it. It was a little tricky to figure out at first and a little messy when I would change it out. The tricks, such as folding it over on itself and twisting so it popped open, giving its \"tail\" a tug to make sure it was secure all worked well for me.\n\nThe only time I have ever had it \"leak\" was when it either got overfilled, which has happened and can happen very quickly because I am such a heavy bleeder, or when I'm having a bowel movement - yes, with it in! I never suffered from any of the discomfort some people had upon insertion or trying to have a bowel movement. Funnily enough, I have been using it as a gauge to figure out how much I put out in a given day and have since talked to my doctor about the amount of flow I have been considerably larger than the average output.\n\nMost importantly: Wonder of wonders; miracle of miracles! I no longer suffer from chills or feeling feverish, nausea is mild and I have never gotten sick again. I still occasionally have some bowel discomfort and cramps, but they're more irregular and less severe, something I can easily control with Midol or a heat pack. I have also not had a single UTI since I made this investment, which is a success story in and of itself!\n\nAll in all, this little device is amazing and I recommend it to all my friends and family members who have vaginas, even for the ones who are just curious to see what the hubbub is about! Try it. If you hate it, chuck it. It's only $20, but it could be the best $20 you ever spend!\n\nThe ONLY thing that I don't like about this product is that, if you purchase a lighter color, it does stain. I had purchased the teal one initially because I thought it looked nice, but after a bit of use, there is some staining around the tab used to pull it out and the rim at the top that does not go away when I clean it. After a month or two of use, I also purchased a hot pink one which I keep in my work bag, in case I start at work. That has not changed colors or stained in any way that I have seen yet.", "Muy c\u00f3moda f\u00e1cil de utilizar manual muy explicativo", "Not the most comfortable cup I have had but also not the worst. The silicone is not as flexible as some other brands that I have tried and took some getting used to. Would still buy again for the price.", "I have been using this cup for the last 3 months and am thrilled with it. Had read this review below and had been waiting until I was sure that it was a product to endorse before sharing it \u2026 this person below is speaking about the Diva Cup that you can get locally at SHOP N\u2019 KART or at Amazon \u2026 I got the Athena as it was more in my price range and have found it to be a perfect match for my body. I love this product and am sharing this review below because I like how she says it \u2026 why aren\u2019t we telling everyone about it! So I am \u2026 or this is my attempt to and btw I cut the stem she talks about off after the second month as it was irritating and it isn\u2019t needed and have had no discomfort at all since :\n\nI also give it 5.0 out of 5 stars\n\nWe Have to Tell Everyone!\nBy RH on March 23, 2011\nSize: Size 2 - 1 Pack Verified Purchase\n\nSeriously? Why doesn\u2019t everyone know about this? It\u2019s like this weird secret \u2013 I mentioned it jokingly in a bar the other night, practically under my breath (while blushing), and three women SQUEEEED as we all came out of the Diva Cup Closet and talked about our Secret Love. And one woman mentioned that she couldn\u2019t wait for her next period, and I swear to god, I FEEL THE SAME WAY. It\u2019s crazypants, people.\n\nWhy is it a secret? Why aren\u2019t we telling EVERYONE?\n\n1. First, let\u2019s all get over that it\u2019s blood. Yes, it\u2019s blood. It\u2019s coming out, one way or another. I\u2019ve found the Diva Cup cleaner than tampons (after that first month which was a very steep red learning curve, indeed. Second month, I had it down and used it while traveling. On a plane. For reals.)\n\n2. Don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re too heavy a bleeder. The packaging says most women bleed 1 to 1.4 oz a month. Me? I fill the 1 oz cup in 3-4 hours on my heavy days. No problem \u2013 I used to have to swap tampons every 1-2 hours in the bad old days, and now I don\u2019t. Quick dump, rinse, replace. (Great idea someone had about bringing a water bottle into the public stall. Or really, a little piece of paper will wipe it out just fine, replace and go, wash it when you get home.) I used to go through an entire box of tampons a month, plus pads. In less than three months, this has paid for itself.\n\n3. Don\u2019t worry that you\u2019re not built for it. FULL DISCLOSURE and TMI ALERT: I have TWO cervixes (and two uteruses, two \u2013 jealous? It\u2019s called uterus didelphis, not as uncommon as it sounds, no one even noticed in me till I was 35, and I\u2019d had multiple ob procedures), so I wasn\u2019t sure this product would work. I even wrote to the company before I bought it, and they didn\u2019t know, either! But because the cup sits below the cervix (or cervices, in some special cases), it works. I bought size 2, since I\u2019m over 30, and it fits right (see note 5).\n\n4. You\u2019ll find your magic insertion method. You will! Mine is inserting HORIZONTALLY as they recommend, a twist while bearing down, and then letting the kegels take that puppy up to do its miraculous job.\n\n5. If that stem seems uncomfortable, TURN THE CUP INSIDE OUT. I saw that recommended somewhere, and it\u2019s the secret for some of us, I\u2019m telling you. Makes it wider and shorter, and I don\u2019t feel it at all. You don\u2019t need the stem to pull it out, and it almost seems like having the stem inside the base makes it easier to grab (again, bearing down slightly is what works for me).\n\nGood God. It\u2019s a miracle. TELL EVERYONE! Hire skywriters! Every gal has to find this out! If just ONE of you buys this because of this review, my work will be done. And if you\u2019re some creepy guy who\u2019s grossed out after reading this because I tweeted it, then, well. You deserved it, didn\u2019t you?\n\nBEST PRODUCT EVER!", "Quick review points:\n1. Great beginner cup\n2. Learning curve is several days (take your time)\n3. No leaks! (Seriously.)\n\nOn a more detailed note...So on prime day the Athena cup was on sale for $12. After considering a cup for several months I couldn\u2019t pass this deal up!\n\nA few days after the cup arrived I started my period and I was actually really excited to try it. I decided to try the U fold since that was the first suggestion in the instructions. I couldn\u2019t even get it in! Was I just too tense? Take 2. Should I fold it a different way? Take 3. OK, it definitely started to pop open and I didn\u2019t know if it was too soon so I pulled it out. Take 4. I was already frustrated and realized I\u2019d been in the bathroom close to 15 minutes. I had to leave my house for an appointment so I just put a tampon in and decided to try again later.\n\nAround lunch time I tried again. After 15 minutes I got it in but it was crooked and pinching me when I walked. So then I tried again, using the \u201ctriangle fold\u201d and finally got it! I went to the beach and it felt fine the whole time. But when I got home it had leaked a little into my swimsuit so I thought I must not have put it up far enough. Wrong. I put it up too far!\n\nI spent 45 minutes that evening freaking out, bearing down over a mirror on the floor and trying not to cry. I finally managed to get it out. Although it had been a tedious and bloody experience, I had enough courage to try again and reinserted in with minimal effort (maybe 2 minutes).\n\nThe following days of my period, using the cup got increasingly easier and less time consuming. I am also happy to say that the next month I had no issues at all. Inserting and removing the cup has become as easy as putting in a tampon. Also, sleeping on my period has truly become a mess-free experience!!!! If that\u2019s not worth $14 I don\u2019t know what is. Overall I am extremely pleased with this product and so happy I\u2019ve made the switch to cups!\n\nOther side notes: the cup will become discolored after a day or two. From what I\u2019ve read this is completely normal. I boil mine once my monthly is finished for extra sanitation. Like the instructions say, this cup is meant to sit low in the vagina. This means you may feel it some throughout the day (if it pinches or hurts it may not be inserted correctly) and when you wipe. Lastly, when removing, \u201cbear down\u201d and release the suction by sliding 1 or 2 fingers in along the side of the cup then pinch. I\u2019m not sure if the small tab is meant for removing the cup but I have not been successful just using that.", "Soooooo happy I finally bought one of these. It's already saved me so much money!!", "Would buy it again. Comfortable and not to ridge. Perfect design for removal and insertion. I will be getting this again.", "My favorite out of all the cups I've tried!! It doesn't show the gross staining that my other cups did. It probably isn't as clean as a result but I love it! I heard a girl pulled her cervix out with one of these so always be cautious to break the seal before you pull it out!!", "Ok, I think this is only my second Amazon review ever, so if that is any indication of how excited I am that this product actually worked, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a better endorsement. I picked this one from reviews and the price point. I\u2019m a mom of four in my early 40\u2019s and don\u2019t even want to think about the money I\u2019ve spent on tampons over the years. I didn\u2019t want to spend too much on something having no idea if I\u2019d even be able to use it, so this was a reasonable gamble. Yesterday my period began with just light spotting so a panty liner did the trick. This morning, we were full steam ahead, so to speak, so I followed the instructions exactly. Washed the cup and my hands in hot soapy water, squeezed it in half, and then folded into a \u201cU\u201d shape. I put my foot up on the toilet seat and shoved it up \u201cthere\u201d hoping for the best but honestly having no idea if I inserted it correctly. I felt a little pressure and cramping at first but quickly forget it was there. A couple of hours later I had to poop, because there\u2019s a lot of that for me when I\u2019m having my period. During that process the cup started coming out, so I gently removed it, and holy moly does it ever work! Needless to say, it was absolutely inserted correctly and worked exactly as designed! Because my bowels are also irritated during my period I often go to the bathroom once every hour or so and as many woman know, you just have to change a tampon every time you go. I\u2019d go through a dozen tampons or more each day, depending on my stomach issues or flow. I often spend $20+ a month on tampons. This is a game changer. The ONLY negatives for me is that it does come out every time I have to have a bowel movement, but if I\u2019m in a private bathroom, I just give it a quick wash and put it back where it belongs. I\u2019ll still have to carry tampons with me when I\u2019ve only got access to a public bathroom stall, but by and large, this one purchase will get me through most of my period each month, for under $15, potentially the rest of my time as a menstruating woman. I love the little storage bag so if I\u2019m close to my period day, and out and about, I can just throw it in my purse. Needless to say, I\u2019m a huge fan, and I entirely irritated with myself for not taking the plunge earlier.", "Month 1\nI am a virgin, and I suspect that if I wasn\u2019t, that using this cup would be easier for me. The first time I put it in it took about 30 minutes, and I ended up having to lay on my back with my legs in the air. It was so painful\u2026and it was painful taking it back out. However, using the cup is teaching me a lot about my vagina, for example, which internal muscles I should squeeze/relax in order to aid taking the cup out/putting it in. After using it for a few days, while it is still painful, the pain is not so much, and I am much better at insertion/extraction. I love that I can just put it in and not worry about it. I usually use pads, and really prefer the cup to this. I have had minimal leakage, much, much less than when I use a tampon. And it\u2019s environmentally friendly! I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if it is still painful to put in/take out in the coming months. My main problem now is that I want to buy it in all the colors\u2026but I only need one!\n\nMonth 2\nIt is so much easier to use! There was hardly any pain putting in/taking the cup out, and it was so much easier than the first month. It literally slid right into place, and I also had no trouble taking it out. I am so happy I decided to try the cup out!\nI have noticed a slight staining on the inside of the cup. I don\u2019t know what has caused this, because I have followed the instructions for cleaning. I hope that, despite the staining, the cup is still sanitary.\n\nMonth 3\nI had absolutely no discomfort putting this in. It was still a little uncomfortable to take out, but that is completely fine. I was traveling when using it this time, and it is so wonderful just being able to experience travel without having to worry about changing out tampons or pads. Also, when I was on my period before, I always had to wear \u201cnormal underwear\u201d to accommodate pads or panty-liners, but with the cup I am able to get away without using either of those, which broadens my underwear options.\nThe only complaint that I have is that the staining is getting worse. I don\u2019t understand, because I have followed the cleaning instructions exactly. I really hope that, despite the staining, it is still safe to use, because I really don\u2019t want to have to get a new one!\n\nMonth 4\nUsing the cup this month was great, I had absolutely no pain putting it in or taking it out. However, the staining has gotten significantly worse, and I am becoming more concerned that the cause could have something to do with bacteria. I have cleaned the cup following the directions faithfully every time I use it. I have the green cup, so it could just be something to do with this particular color.\n\nAll in all, I absolutely love that I have a way to manage my period without having to go through mounds of hygiene products each month. I am, however, taking one star off because of the staining of the cup. I swear, I took care of it the way I was supposed to, I don't know why it's stained! I have never gotten a UTI from wearing the cup (I am very resistant to such things though), so I guess that means that the cup is still sanitary.", "A m\u00ed esposa le ha encantado este producto. Dice que es c\u00f3moda, f\u00e1cil de colocar y de retirar, no ha tenido derrames.", "Feels soft and really easy to forget it's there. I've only used a few times on my period, and it definitely gives you a clear idea of how heavy your flow is. I always knew mine is heaviest in the first day or two. Unfortunately I would change my tampons every four to six hours using regular absorbency (as I could never fill a super in 8 hours on my heavy flow.)\n\nRequires many uses to be fully comfortable, and get in the habit of leaving it in all day. It feels like a personal test to see how long it will take me to fill, or even get over halfway full, as I'm so used to changing tampons more often. I'm grateful to have a lighter than average flow, something I only could have found out with a cup. Changing to these reusable menstrual products has positively impacted my life. It's a huge relief to know after buying this and some pads, I won't have to worry about sparing some money for my time of the month.\n\nI chose this cup for two reasons (aside from the variety of colors.) First, the short stem. I was concerned a long stem might feel uncomfortable, that I would always be able to feel it. The short stem of the Athena cup is textured with rings and quite small. The cup is supposed to be positioned just outside the vagina at the lower end, so the stem should stick out. Depending on the shape and constriction of your lady parts, the stem may rest against you down there. At first I was worried this meant that I placed it incorrectly, but surprisingly found that the feeling goes away after a while. You're supposed to twist the stem after you put it in, to ensure the cup fully expands, and the small stem makes this difficult when you're nervous and tight. So try to relax once you insert it. If it hurts at all, you can remove, rinse and try again. Getting it wet around the edges helps.\n\nThe second reason I decided on this cup was the holes at the top that are supposed to help prevent suction. The fact of the matter is using this cup creates a vacuum, which causes some suction until it is out far enough for the holes to function. I will say the feeling is similar to pulling out a tampon, with two distinct differences. One, the cup is wider, so if you rotate the stem in little circles as you pull it out, it is smoother and far more comfortable than using this method with a tampon, and the suction eases around you, rather than increasing by pulling straight down. The gentle silicone feels light and slides out easily, rather than the slight burning, tearing feeling of a tampon coming out.\n\nBesides the rewarding feeling of not leaving behind wrappers and waste, it's like I'm just washing it all away. My boyfriend has noticed I am more jovial and far less irritable now. Doing any kind of physical activity, walking, running, stairs, you name it, causes less strain on your lower belly with the Athena cup. Your body and wallet will thank you for the investment, and I promise you will feel better and learn so much about yourself with regular use. My cousin bought an diva cup and would not stop raving about it, so I had to try. It was well worth the money, especially on long days when I work double shifts.", "I bought this product as an alternative to a Diva Cup because of the cheaper price. I figured if I didn't like the menstrual cup concept, I wouldn't be wasting as much money this way. I've now been using this same period cup for 3 years, and I've had zero problems with it that were not user error. I love it!! But be forewarned if you've never used a period cup: there is definitely a learning curve in figuring out how to use it correctly. You'll have to experiment to find the trick that gets the right fit for you, because it will depend on the shape/curve of your cervix. I suggest practicing with this product -- inserting it, removing and emptying it, cleaning it -- when you know you're going to be at home, unencumbered. It's a messy business, and I can almost guarantee that you won't get the insertion process right the first few times, and it will leak. Trust me on this! The key to no leakage is to get a good seal on the cup. FYI: you'll know you've achieved this when the cup is REALLY hard to move downward, as if you're trying to pull it out -- almost, hey, like it's sealed in there! :P It's a similar sensation to attempting the free movement of a suction cup once the seal is good. (I hope that makes sense??) I have friends with lighter periods than me who don't even wear panty liners when they have this cup in because they are so confident in it now; however, I personally wear a thin pad in the event the cup fills up before I can change it (it will obviously overflow then and start leaking, regardless of having a good seal). I bought the regular size because I haven't had children, and even though I have pretty heavy flow the first 2-3 days of my periods, this size is sufficient for me. I recommend this product to all my girlfriends that want to save money on feminine products, or that go through tampons and pads too quickly.\n----\n**UPDATE 2/2022**\nStill loving this!! It's discolored now, but that's my only complaint, and that's just a cosmetic issue that doesn't ultimately matter for effective use. But as I've gotten older and my period has continued to get heavier, I have been noticing the past couple of years that it fills up faster, so I am considering moving up to the larger size. I still haven't had children, soooo, if you're someone with a very heavy period, I definitely suggest going with the bigger one!", "This is my second menstrual cup purchase ever. I was a consistent user of a Blossom Cup for several years before I got married and got pregnant with my first, at which point, I threw out the Blossom Cup, thinking that I would need a size upgrade. After my period came back and I found that the Blossom Cup was no longer in production, I went ahead and purchased the Size 2 Athena Cup, since it seemed more or less the same product under a different brand name. You can imagine my surprise when I popped in the Size 2 and found that the stem stuck out rather farther than it should have. I could feel it sticking between my labial lips when I stood up and walked, and it would constantly catch the toilet paper when I wiped going to the bathroom. So, I was not a fan.\n\nI determined the issue was likely that my cervix was too low and was pushing the cup down. (My first was born a little over ten pounds, so that probably explains the changes in my cervix.) I went ahead and ordered the Size 1, since the cup was comfortable other than the stem issue, and found that it fits much better. I still have to make sure that it's seated up high enough around the cervix that it doesn't get pushed down, but the stem remains tucked in much better than the larger size and only pokes out a tiny bit.\n\nLesson learned. The postpartum recommended size is not always the best size for you postpartum. I'm still hanging on to it in case I ever need a \"spare,\" but it won't be in consistent use as my primary cup.", "This is my first purchase of a menstral cup and I must have read a million reviews- all on different brands. First off- I'm pleased with the quality of this cup. I settled on Athena because the price was right, it came in colors I like (I heard they stain, so getting a purple, red or black will cut down on the ick factor), and it had a nice storage pouch. However, the biggest factor came from reading several reviews- the Athena Cup was a good mix of not too thin and not too thick.\n\nBeing a new product for me, it takes some getting used to. On my 4th day, I feel like I have it under control. I wore a pantiliner (always do anyway) and carried a tampon, just in case. Never had to use the tampon.\n\nI'm probably getting close to menopause, so my flow isn't as much anymore. I was able to change it once every 24 hours, though my first day I waited a tad too long. Nothing my pantiliner couldn't handle.\n\nMy daughter, however, is a teenager, and she's the one who was begging for me to purchase one for her (which is why I got one for myself). She had a heavy flow and goes through a super plus tampon every 2 hours on her first day. She was amazed that she only needed to empty the cup twice a day- once before school and once after school. This will be a life changer for her, for sure! She immediately complained about the tab on the cup, but I told her to wait before trimming it. She's glad she waited, because she became used to it, and liked the length for easier removal and insertion. So- don't be too quick to trim it!\n\nAnyway. That's my take on it. Good quality cup. Nice storage pouch. Take the plunge and get one! I'm so excited to not have to buy tampons any more!!!\n\nUpdate: It\u2019s been over a year now and I haven\u2019t gone back to tampons or pads. Neither has my teenager. They\u2019re great and I\u2019m very pleased with the life change I\u2019ve made! As a matter of fact, I just purchased ANOTHER pair of these for both my daughter and myself. (We don\u2019t share them. Eww! Stop thinking like that!) Anyway, there\u2019s nothing wrong with the original ones. The originals have held up nicely. Though I wash it thoroughly, my purple cup has a patina to it now, but that\u2019s no worry. It works just as nicely as it did new. I ordered a second one to have as a spare or backup. Or, if I think it might hit while I\u2019m at work, I can leave my spare in it\u2019s nice little pouch in my glove box and I\u2019m all set. I even used it while camping this past Summer! Not easy, but still better than packing out the \u201cdisposable\u201d pads/tampons. Speaking of that, I haven\u2019t done the math, but I know I\u2019ve saved a ton of money by moving away from disposables, but this wasn\u2019t about the money anyway. I just know I\u2019ve saved a lot. Take the plunge and try it out.", "I switched to the cup several years ago to save money and here is what I have found. Now when I look for a cup I look for flexibility, a short stem, and color.\n\n1. No matter what you do eventually it will change color. This is why I have switched to black cups. They hide stains and honestly I'm not much of a \"pink\" girl. Also it's your period we don't need to beautify it.. My favorite comment about the mass amount of light pink products on cups is \"I'm a grown women I don't need things to be infant colored\" Lol seriously! Stop it companies! Pink is the worst color for these things (eye roll).\n\n2. Long stems suck and don't help when removing these things. I had a cup for a while(my first one) that had a long stem and I ended up cutting it off. Usually when I remove these things I pinch the bottom of the actual cup(helps release seal) and pull out while also using my \"push muscles\" yes the same muscles you use to take a shit or birth a baby lol. Trust me it works. Also sitting is the easiest way. I find its harder after a shower for some reason soo do it pre-shower. I always dump the blood into the toilet, then wash in the sink. They say wash it in cold water to rinse off the blood and then hot water to avoid staining.\n\n3. My cups usually last about 2-3 years before they start smelling... It's probably me that could be better about this... Eventually I'm going to invest in one of those steamer cleaners. Right now I just use dish soap and hot water.\n\nAnyways, I like this cup. Its a good one because of its shape and color. I don't feel a need to invest in a more expensive one. I also like the bag for storage."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01761062W", "title": "CeraVe Moisturizing Lotion for Itch Relief | Anti Itch Lotion with Pramoxine Hydrochloride | Relieves Itch with Minor Skin Irritations, Sunburn Relief, Bug Bites | 8 Ounce", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51ZIEPuelDL._SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "13,045 ratings", "description": "Developed with dermatologists, CeraVe Itch Relief Moisturizing Lotion temporarily relieves itching associated with minor skin irritations, insect bites and sunburn.

The 8 x 10 arrived rolled while the 10 x 13 arrived folded. The rugs are a little thin and is one reason I bought the rug pads.

My two main requirements on this quest are 1, soft to the touch and 2, odorless. I have journeyed through Huggies  Huggies Natural Care Baby Wipes, Sensitive, Unscented, 3 Refill Packs, 648 Count Total , Bloom  bloom BABY Sensitive Skin Unscented Hypoallergenic Baby Wipes, 80-Count , Babyganics  Babyganics Face, Hand & Baby Wipes, Fragrance Free, 400 Count (Contains Four 100-Count Packs) , and now Seventh Generation. My thoughts are as below.\n\nHuggies Wipes\nPro - large size, you can wipe and fold and re-wipe up to three x with the same sheet. I have done this when my little one has some massive diaper mess overload, not a problem. Mild lemony scent, i don't love or hate this but some parents may or may not like this. Affordable price.\nCon - drench in solution. This is not a problem when you purchase the single pack pullout on the go pack with the plastic snap cover. But with the refillable large bulk pack, they are drenched in solution. Everytime i open a pack to refill in my wipe warmer container, i have to squeeze out a ton of solution or the wipe will end up sitting in a puddle of liquid. This is a major drawback for me because i have found that if i don't make sure to squeeze out the liquid, everytime i pull a sheet out to wipe it will come out dripping with solution, which causes a big mess when you are trying to clean and wipe your little one dry. This is my reason to leave Huggie and move on to Bloom.\n\nBloom Wipes\nPro - large size, same advantage as Huggies in term of sizing, which you can wipe 3 x before toss out as opposed to grabbing three wipes for one diaper change. Very subtle to none when it comes to scent. Just the right amount of solution. The Bloom logo imprinted into the wipe are much nicer looking than Huggies. Self adhesive single pack that you can take on the go or refill into container at home.\nCon - cost a whooping 5 cents a sheet which more than double that of Huggies cost. Softer than Huggies wipes, but a little too thick for my liking. Some of my fellow parenting friends thinks I'm crazy since thicker should be better when it comes to wipes? But i personally feel because of the thickness, it still feel a tad course to the touch and not truly soft upon skin contact in my opinion. With this, my journey for the perfect wipe continues and i found myself with Babyganics.\n\nBabyganics Wipes\nPro - oh so soft to the touch. This is the softest wipe i have every laid my hands on. I love this so much that i sometimes would use it as hand cleaning for myself. Mild lemony scent. Just the right amount of solution. Self adhesive single pack that you can take on the go or refill into container at home.\nCon - moderately priced. Not the cheapest when compared to Huggies. Veryyyyyy small in size. This is what i would call Petite Wipes, or truly \"Baby Wipes\" pun intended. What i can do with my Huggies and Bloom's i now have to use one wipe per each wipe, which mean one messy diaper load change will require about 4 to 5 wipes, as opposed to 2 from Bloom or Huggies. My pack last for a shorter amount of time than the other two brands as mentioned above. But, even with the smaller size, i was willing to compromise on this brand until i find another drawback with this. With this wipe, it does not work when you put it in a wipe warmer container. I have the Munchkin Wipe Warmer  Munchkin Warm Glow Wipe Warmer , and i can tell you just forget about putting the wipes in here. It will not pull out through the opening because the wipes are so small in size. I have to open the lid each time i do a diaper change and manually taking out each sheet, which instantly makes the wipe turns cold because too much heat are let out when the whole lid is open. With this, my journey for the perfect wipe sadly continues onto Seventh Generation.\n\nSeventh Generation Wipes\nPro - large size, same advantage as Huggies and Blooms. No scent. Self adhesive single pack that you can take on the go or refill into container at home.\nCon - moderately priced. Not the cheapest when compared to Huggies. Less solution and less moist than Bloom and Babyganics. This is a major deal breaker for me because with this, the wipe now feels very course and rough to the touch. Since i bought a large pack i now have to finish this and my quest will continue on for the next brand.\n\nFinal Thought -\nOut of all four brands that i have tried so far, i will say Babyganics remains my favorite. Despite the ultra small size, the cost, and the inconvenience of it not working with the wipe warmer, i will sacrifice using it out the single pack if i have to choose one brand to stay with simply because i love the softness of it and the silky touch of it against my baby's skin. Until i found my next perfect wipe, Babyganics will be my choice.\n\nCost Comparison\nHuggies - 648 ct / $14.63 = $0.022 / sheet\nBloom - 640 ct / $32.36 = $0.050 / sheet\nBabyganics - 600 ct / $21.00 = $0.035 / sheet\nSeventh Generation - 768 ct / $28.99 = $0.038 / sheet", "I bought these when Costco suddenly stopped selling Huggies. After more than 6 years of the same wipe I was nervous to branch out. Well, I loved these more than I could have imagined. These are soft, super thick, have no real smell, and have been gentle on the skin of everyone in the house. My kids are usually fine but my skin is freakishly sensitive and given I handle whatever wipe we use all day, they have to be gentle on me and these really deliver.\n\nAs for general use, the patterns on wipe matter. I\u2019ve used the occasional pack from different brands here and there over the years and the more \u201ctextured\u201d wipes work better. Those ridges do actually scrub. These wipes have an attractive and effective geometric pattern. They\u2019re also really wet and they maintain their moisture. The adhesive opening is kind of terrible but despite constantly being exposed to air these never seem to dry out. Even if my husband leaves a wipe hanging out for hours, it\u2019ll still be decently wet which is actually kind of weird. We decided to switch to the Honest Company diaper subscription and it comes with wipes included. I\u2019m kind of sad about that as those wipes, while more textured and therefore more effective, seem to rub tiny bottoms a bit too well. You can literally feel the scrubbing action... I\u2019d rather use 1-2 more of these wipes and have the experience be a bit more gentle. But since it\u2019s wasteful to not use something I\u2019m paying for I\u2019ll keep them. If I drop that sub or find 4 packs a month isn\u2019t enough I\u2019ll be supplementing with these versus more Honest brand ones even though I could get those at a discount.\n\nAs for the included travel case, don\u2019t buy this for that. The zipper literally crumbled in my hand on first use. It\u2019s a nice thought, but I felt bad tossing it straight in the trash. A nicer, more useful gesture, would be to just include an actual travel pack instead.", "Bloom wipes are definitely more expensive per wipe than some of the more popular brands. However, we've found that they are worth the extra price with the time and hassle they save. The wipes are larger and thicker than the leading brands, making it easier to clean up the bigger messes. I find that a situation that would require at least 4 of the leading brand wipes can easily be handled with 3 of the Bloom wipes.\n\nThese wipes are also good on tender skin. Areas that have been irritated due to diaper rash don't seem to be as bothered by wiping with these ones as some of the other formulations out there. There are wipes out there that I think are a bit more geared toward sensitive skin, but for the most part these do just fine.\n\nThe travel packaging is not ideal. That is my biggest complaint. The top does not seal well and the wipes can dry out because of this. At home, we just transfer them to the larger plastic containers and they do great. But in our baby backpack there are occasionally issues. A better closing package would be very helpful.\n\nAt this point, these are our go-to wipes. I won't buy any others unless I'm in an absolute pinch.", "Of all the things the hoarders cleared the shelves of, as the Coronavirus pandemic set across our great country, this is the one item I miss most. I don\u2019t write reviews, but 2.5 weeks in, I find myself still searching for these wipes Everyday. C\u2019mon Jeffie, get them in stock please.\nEven though these wipes cost more, there worth it. In 3 years I\u2019ve yet to find a wipe that compares! They\u2019re larger, softer, perfectly moistened and stronger. You use less Bc of their size, moisture balance and strength so to me they are a sensible investment. Having been forced to go w/ water wipes during this period, every time I change a diaper I remember the good ol\u2019 days. 1st world, health family, food on the shelves problem? Yes. Absolutely, But man do I miss these wipes. This is a product I would have gladly paid double for on eBay lol. Price gauge me!! Just get us our wipes back! Please.\nIf you\u2019re on the fence, if you\u2019re thinking you don\u2019t want to pay the extra couple of dollars for these, stop wondering. Buy them and see for yourself. This is a great product, (the closure on the pack is a little weak), but other then that, they\u2019re the perfect wipe in an imperfect world! :)", "I have tried nearly ever wipe on the market for my 6 mo old - Pampers Sensitive, Pampers Pure, Water Wipes, Target brand wipes, Natracare organic cotton wipes, Amazon wipes, Babyganics, Seventh Generation.......and these are by far the best wipe I have tried. Please note - none of the wipes I tried irritated by babies' bottom, so I cannot speak to whether these wipes are good for sensitive skin/eczema/diaper rash. My review is based on how well they clean, how they feel to the touch, moisture content, linting, and longevity. They offer superior cleaning, probably partially due to the thickness of the wipe - these wipes are THICK. Thicker than any of the above-mentioned wipes. They aren't too wet or too dry, but just right. They do not lint all over my babies' bottom like the seventh generation wipes did. They are large, so you can clean up #2 using fewer wipes than with any of the other brands listed. My only complaint would be that they come in a large pack, too large to just throw in your purse and go.....BUT they offer a plastic zip bag in each box that can be used for this purpose. After a lot of trial and error, I have found my forever wipe LOL Just try these and you won't be disappointed! I also think they are more cost effective because they are so large and heavy duty that you can use fewer wipes over the long run.", "Update:\n\nI made the switch to Bloom over two years ago for my first kid and we\u2019re still using them and absolutely loving them for my second. I made the mistake of not upping my subscribe and save order of these when we had the new baby and I ran out a few days shy of my next delivery. I decided to run to the store and buy just enough of other sensitive wipe brands to get us to delivery day. I decided to try out Water Wipes, Pampers Pure wipes, and the Huggies sensitive wipes, and I honestly had no clue how good we had it with the Bloom wipes. Those things are like the Cadillac of wipes. I was shocked, even the water wipes were SO thin and flimsy in comparison to the bloom wipes. We use bloom wipes to clean up EVERYTHING in our house including getting stains out of the couch! I think I probably used 5 or 6 water wipes for one newborn poopy diaper, whereas I can use one or two bloom wipes for a toddler poopy diaper. Everyone should do themselves a favor and switch to Bloom ASAP.\n\nI switched to from the Pampers Sensitive to these and I haven't had to use Boudreaux's on my son once since then. When we used the Pampers wipes, he got a rash at least twice a week, and now I haven't seen any redness at all. It's a huge improvement, and I will definitely be switching to Bloom permanently!", "These are hands down the best nontoxic wipes I've come across since my daughter was born last year. All other brands with low EWG scores are small, thin, have a weird scent, are too wet, and/or require multiple wipes to get the job done (and yes, I've tried each and every one). These wipes? They're big, thick, soft, well-textured, have a very mellow scent, and will clean up just about any mess with one wipe. In fact, for light jobs, I can rip them in half since they're so effective! Most importantly? To date, they have not irritated my daughter's sensitive skin at all. The packaging is fine... never had an issue with the bag tearing or the seal not sealing. Since they're larger wipes, they likely won't fit in your average diaper bag wipe holder. I just throw mine into the bag for on-the-go use. It's a bit bulky, but well worth it. Unlike some reviewers on here, I've never had an issue with mold or anything else in any of my wipe packages. My one complaint and the reason why I'm giving them four stars instead of five is price. The cost of these has more than doubled here on Amazon since I started using them despite nothing about the wipes themselves changing.", "I bought these after much research while i was pregnant. While i was in the hospital I was given several packs of water wipes which I loved so much because they were nothing but water. I was sad to move over to these when I ran out of the others because these weren't nearly as wet. I had bought 2 cases and it took me about 5 months to go through them all. After i ran through my initial 2 cases i bought a case of water wipes. You would be surprised to hear i wasn't happy with the price i paid for the water wipes and they were not jumbo size like these are so poop would get all over my fingers. And you only got 60 per pack verses the 80 jumbo in these.\nI went back to these and they are almost perfect. I took 1 star off because they aren't as wet but i love that they are jumbo wipes and have ridges which make it easier to grab the poop off baby's butt. There's hardly a scent at all. My baby hasn't shown any signs of irritation either. I took a second star off because this time around the box arrived damaged with the individual packages just thrown into a big bag. This is my third go around purchasing these wipes from Amazon and this is the first time they didn't arrive in their original case box inside an Amazon box.\nOverall, i recommend them.\nGreat price, great size, no irritation!", "These are the best baby wipes we've used. We use them for more than just diaper changes. They're a great size - I can't imagine ever going back to the smaller wipes. They don't cause rashes like the smaller and more expensive Water Wipes that everyone raved about. However, I've wiped my own hands and face with these on a few occasions and I will say there's a bit of an uncomfortable sensation for a short time after, but I do have fairly sensitive skin. It doesn't seem to bother our son, though, so I don't see us switching. I'm so glad they were added to the subscribe and save program - I hope it stays that way because we buy cases at a time!\n\nEditing 4/27/20-- still our exclusive wipes brand, but they're out of stock on Amazon and I haven't been able to get ahold of the company, so I'm worried they are out of business. I've been buying them up wherever I can find them because I seriously don't think there's another wipe that would work for us as well as these have!", "Great wipes! Checked the ingredients against a few reputable sources, and this is by far the best I\u2019ve come across. I refuse to use the Honest diapers after their recall and have found these to be even better. No weird smell. Just the right amount of wetness. Why only four stars? They include these travel wipe soft plastic things in the bigger boxes. It\u2019s a nice bonus, however, they almost always break. (They fasten by a center zipper.) I thought it was just one time, but it kept happening. So on a few occasions I\u2019ve put wipes in their little travel clutch thing and gone out only to find the wipes drying out because the zipper thingy failed so it won\u2019t stay closed. Now when I get a new box of wipes and the travel pouches are in there, I don\u2019t use them because I don\u2019t want to waste the wipes. So I feel guilty about throwing it the extra plastic. SO if they want to include them as a freebie, make them strong enough to last for a decent amount of time. Otherwise save the plastic and don\u2019t include them.", "I liked how big the wipes were and it helped clean my baby\u2019s bottom very well. It was also one of the few baby wipes that I didn\u2019t have to worry about the ingredients for my own skin allergy. These wipes as well as Honest company do not have sodium benzoate as an ingredient. The scent I wasn\u2019t too crazy about but maybe with time, I would have gotten used to it. I also would have bought more but when I checked the pricing for bigger packs... it was way too much for my budget. I went with Honest Company instead but if it wasn\u2019t for the pricing of the bigger packs...I\u2019d buy both brands. \ud83d\ude01 Please remember my review is for the very small pack that\u2019s great for a trial run of maybe a day at most. \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude04", "I am a little disappointed in these wipes. I heard many good things about them and saw a lot of great reviews on how they are free of so many harsh chemicals and had no bad scent.\n\nHowever, when I received them, I did find that they had an odor kind of like the flushable Scott wipes or Charmin wipes. If you like that smell then you'll like these wipes. I don't.\n\nAlso, they contain Phenoxyethanol in the ingredients which I know is an antimicrobial/preservative agent, but is also known to be bad ( a suspected carcinogen).\n\nOne last negative is that they don't have a \"pop top\" lid so when you pull out a wipe and another one starts coming out you have to stuff that one back in all the way to be able to close the sticker tab. If you don't stick the wipe all the way back in (mostly flat) then the tab will come open and you will end up having dry wipes.\n\nI did order another brand of wipes called Jackson Reece Kinder by Nature. It got a lot of great reviews and a good rating on \" Give Me the Good Stuff\" website. It supposedly doesn't have all the chemicals and is the \"cleanest\" wipe out there besides the Water Wipe. I ordered the unscented wipe because I heard the Herbal one was too potent. I only use the water wipes for the hands and face and not for the butt because it doesn't have any antibacterial agent in it to clean up bacteria filled fecal matter.\n\nHope this helps!", "So far I like these wipes and I like the ingredients. The travel pack is useless. They are pricey is you are buying a pack which has less then 640 counts. The top doesn't seal well but it seems like an issue with the most wipes on the market. I bought a separate plastic box to keep them wet. Also they are not completely unscented, there is a mild scent but it seems to be fine with me.", "These wipes are so so awesome. My daughter had a bad reaction to Pampers Sensitive, so I was searching for something affordable, but more natural. I like the Water Wipes, but I have heard of a lot of people say that they have found mold in their packages. I tend to stockpile, so I didn't want to go that route. These have been amazing, work great and my daughter has had no bad reaction. It also comes with a little travel pouch in each of the larger boxes. The travel pouch is awesome to hold the wipes that won't fit in my wipes warmer or to hold wipes when I had to open a whole package to fit a few in my smaller travel wipes case. Now if they would just make a travel size package so I wouldn't have to split the packages, we would be all set. I am always running out at the most inconvenient times, and to be able to just throw a small pack in my bag would be awesome.", "I have had four kids. I am fairly particular about wipes. These are by far the best. I am even giving them five stars even though I hate the packaging. These wipes are thick, but not too thick, they are stretchy, but not too stretchy\u2026 The packaging states these are unscented because there is no scent added... But they do have a light, natural scent. It smells kind of like\u2026 Aloe or cucumber; something floral but also kind of fresh. Subtle. The scent doesn\u2019t bother me at all and it goes away quickly. I am very particular about smells! I detest all strong scents And my sense of smell is exceedingly keen. I really like the size and texture of the swipe. I have tried everything, and I mean everything! These are by far my favorite. I really wish though that they would package it in a way that the cover didn\u2019t snap off immediately. That\u2019s really annoying.", "We have been an unscented household for health reasons for about 20 years, and use wipes for personal hygeine and cleaning. Had been looking for a new brand of wipes, because our old brand's manufacturing has gotten careless and started contaminating the fragrance free wipes with fragrance from other products.\n\nWhen our first box of these arrived, I could smell a low level of fragrance on the outside of the box. Delicate, gentle smell, but fragrance none the less. Remember, I have lived in a fragrance free home for 20 years so smell things at levels far below what normal people could detect. When I opened the box, the fragrance smell was stronger, and I got a momentary headache. But the labels on the box/pouch said what I was smelling was natural ingredients, so I made the mistake of bringing the 8 pouches into the house. My wife, 3 rooms away, had an immediate reaction but did not immediately smell anything. I opened one of the packages and smelled and touched a wipe (which was physically soft and gentle in a way we would really love) but it was clear there was a fragrance in the product, not only to which I was reacting, but which was spreading around the house.\n\nI couldn't even put these in my car to ship them back for return. They're in many layers of plastic bags in the trash outside, and I just hope the bags hold the fragrance in until the trash people come next week. The whole downstairs of our house is contaminated by this fragrance, which is giving my wife low level systemic symptoms, and I hope it dissipates soon. What is confusing is that our reactions are typical to a solvent or enhancer in some but not all synthetic fragrances (unfortunately these ingredients aren't disclosed so we haven't been able to chase down a particular ingredient), and the very well written and presented ingredients list/disclosure on the packaging doesn't seem to include a solvent capable of bringing the fragrance through the plastic of the pouches.", "I was so excited when I found these wipes. They were brand new and no one had even heard of them. I feel like over time, their quality has changed for the negative and I will no longer be purchasing them. The packaging is not good at all and when you grab one wipe, 3-4 come out with it. It's enough for me to switch brands as changing diapers, especially when you're out, requires things to be quick and convenient. Having to stuff wipes back into the package after each use is enough for me to purchase another brand. I will be switching to Pampers Sensitive as their portable packs have a great seal and are easy to dispense.", "I have done so much research on wipes for my sensitive skin-eczema prone baby. I looked at ingredients, texture, size, and cost. My favorite wipes by far are the Honest Company Wipes. In choosing wipes, most important are the ingredients. I haven't tried the Water Wipes, but from reviews and looking at the material, I know they wouldn't work for me. I need a wipe with texture and those don't cut it. What I like about the Honest Wipes is out of all the wipes I compared, Bloom, BabyGanics, Amazon Elements, and Pampers Sensitive, they have the least harmful ingredients. I thought I had found a suitable replacement for the Honest wipes, but unfortunately I did not. A few dislikes are #1 these wipes have Phenoxyethanol which is rated a 4 on the EWG site. I understand this ingredient is used as a preservative, and is probably safe since it's only being wiped vs consumed, but I prefer to avoid if necessary. These also have a slight smell I don't care for, and the texture although nice and soft, still doesn't compare to the Honest Wipes' texture. So it looks like I'm back to the Honest Wipes, I just wish they weren't so expensive! But it's worth the extra cost for my little one.", "These are by far the best wipes I have used. My mother-in-law randomly found these before my first daughter was born and I went through the box and then used other brands I had gotten from my baby shower (pampers, huggies, up & up, parent's choice, etc), and none of them even compared to this brand. I have been faithfully using these wipes for years now. My daughter has never had a diaper rash, these wipes always stay wet for me, and I love that they are oversized and much larger than the other wipe brands. You end up needing to use less wipes because of the size, and they clean up very well. Can't say enough great things about these wipes! Being able to order them on Amazon Prime and have them at my doorstep 2 days later is a blessing as well. HIGHLY recommend these!", "These are great baby wipes, gentle enough for kids and pets.

The munchies brand is hands-down one of the best at masking diaper pail smells even.", "I\u2019ve switched between these and another. These work but sometimes the bags pull out quicker than they are supposed to. Since the bag pulls out quicker they do not last as long as others.", "We have bought these for their intended use with the munchkin diaper pail. We really don\u2019t have any complaints other than the fact that they will not last you as long as the diaper pail/manufacturer suggest. We have gotten a few months out of the full set of them.. no where close to a year, but once the child gets older and diaper changes are fewer they will definitely last for longer. The diaper pail itself can only hold so many so you will think the bag is full before it actually is- in this case my tip would be to shake/push down the diapers in the bag (by squeezing the outside of the bag at the top end) the best you can before cutting the bag off and starting a new one. This will allow you to get a few more diapers in. Also, when starting a new bag be sure to tie your knot as close to the end as possible, but also being sure that it is no too close to the end to cause it to open when full. This will also help ensure you are able to get a larger amount of diapers in the bag.\n\nOther than the above, they are easy to use with the diaper pail and we haven\u2019t found them to have any overwhelming scent. You do not smell the dirty diapers when in the pail bag/pail either. They are very durable and we have not had any issues with them breaking open from too many diapers, etc.\n\nI would recommend this product, especially to use with the munchkin diaper pail. Hope this was helpful!", "Product is as advertised. Good product.", "These are great! I love the fact that the trash bags are all in one dispense. These are much easier to use than the single use trash bags that fit the Munchkin trashcan.", "We. Love. These. Things. And we aren't the kind of people to buy things like this - we prefer to figure out our own \"hack\" and save some money. But we all know that when you have a new baby (along with an older child), it just isn't the time to be adding work to your life. So we decided to go the easy route and use these. One of the best decisions ever (along with purchasing the Munchkin brand diaper pail). They are super-easy to use, and they actually keep the stink INSIDE the bag, not floating around in the air stinking up the room. (Side note, after cutting the top end of the bag and getting ready to tie it off, I've squished the bag to get all of the air out in order to have more room to tie it, and was blasted in the face with the stink of several days' worth of dirty diapers. Gross. But the awesome thing is that I never smelled it until I opened the bag up to press the air out. They're that good.) The only negative, and the reason for one less star, is that there is no warning as to when you're getting to the end of the supply of plastic bag. You're pulling the bag out to tie it off after emptying the pail, and all of a sudden it's out. And you're left with just enough bag to not be able to use it - there's not enough to reach to the bottom of the pail. You can try, but the first diaper you stick in there will make the bag drop out of its holder, rendering it useless. It needs some sort of indicator that it's about to run out so you can plan accordingly; maybe something like they have on cash register paper.", "Ordered these as replacements for my Munchkin Diaper Disposal and they are so easy to refill! The value for money is great because they last a long time! It holds so many dirty diapers! I just opened my second one and my baby is only 5 weeks old!", "We have been using these refills with the Munchkin Step diaper pail, and they have generally worked just fine. The bags themselves have a mild fragrance to them that I neither like nor dislike. Fortunately the fragrance is mild enough that it's unlikely to bother you unless you are extremely sensitive to scents (and some people are).\n\nMy biggest complaint about these refills is that there is no way to know when you are near the end of a tube. Frequently I'll pull a new section down to find that there was only about a foot left, which can lead to some wasted bag.\n\nA few tips:\n1) Ignore the company's estimate for how long these refills will last you. A year's worth? Not even close. Perhaps in an ideal setting with just a few diapers per day, all newborn size, and cramming as many in as possible... but even that is a stretch. It took us about 4 months to go through this entire set of refills.\n2) To maximize the number of diapers you get in each bag, when the pail is full, before cutting the tube to create the next \"bag,\" hold the bag above the diapers and press the contents down to compact them a bit and you will often regain about 6-10 inches of space at the top (do this by pressing THROUGH the bag, not by reaching INTO it). Squeezing most of the air from the bag before you seal it will also help waste less space.\n3) When following tip #2 be sure to hold your breath for a few seconds, especially when squeezing the air from the bag, as the \"fragrance\" which bursts forth is not exactly floral.\n4) When starting and finishing a bag, try to tie the knots as close to the ends of the bag as you reasonably can -- but be careful because if you leave the ends TOO short the knot can come untied, which is not fun.\n\nThese may not be perfect, but then what is \"perfect\" when you're talking about diaper disposal? They work fine for us.", "HARD TO INSTALL....", "Purchased this for the Munchkins step diaper pail and will probably purchase again for when my baby is older and eating solids. Currently she\u2019s only 2 months old and these fill up way too fast to be worth the expense.\n\nPro:\n-Sturdy plastic-I shoved the bags full to reduce waste and never had to worry about the bag ripping\n-Easy to install-just pull out the bag and put the ring into the pail\n-Easy to replace the bags by simply cutting off the amount you want and tying off the end for a new bag\n-Can control how much diapers you want in the bag before taking it out\n-Pleasant smell\n\nCon:\n-Doesn\u2019t fit as many diapers as you would think. Mine gets filled from 1-2 days of diapers for a newborn.\n-Expensive \u2014 I went through 2 refills in 3 weeks\n-No indicator on when the bag is running out so sometimes you end up with a tiny section at the end that\u2019s wasted\n\nI can see how these would be useful for when the baby start having smelly diapers from eating solids.

Some good ingredients are vitamin C, hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, ceramides, retinol, vitamin e (even if not listed specifically, it is naturally contained in a lot of oils like argan, jojoba, etc).

She sells 1 oz for $72.00. You can look up marula oil & not find one other brand that sells it for even close to that price. Yes, the drunk elephant brand is unrefined but so are most of the others. Other brands sell the same thing for anywhere from $6.00 to $16.00 an ounce. That example right there says a lot. I do not mind to pay more for good, quality skincare products but I feel like this is one of those brands that uses effective (yet commonly used) ingredients and puts a ridiculous price tag on it to make us think it must work better. After seeing that about the marula oil, it left a bad taste in my mouth for this brand.", "I've been using this serum for a few months now. I love the bottle and how easy it is to travel with.

This serum goes on nicely and soaks in very quickly, which is great if you're in a hurry to apply makeup and get out the door. It also dries pretty weightless and soft so there isn't a noticeable residue. I would not say that this serum is hydrating, however, at all. You definitely have to use a good moisturizer over top of it. If you're looking for a hydration serum that will give your skin a nice little dewy pump, or a one-and-done product to use at night this is not the one.

A scent the whole family is OK with.\n\nRight or wrong, my thought process was to take these scent boosters & dilute the chemicals by adding other 'healthier' solvents to it that are beneficial to laundry as well so the scent boosters aren't used alone & as chemically potent. I add:\n1. Baking Soda... which is WONDERFUL for taking teenage hormonal stink out of anything.\n2. Salt... which is great for softening our clothes with our EXTREMELY hard water.\n\nEven diluted with other solvents, these scent boosters leave just as much smell as if they were used alone. I have a front-end washer with EXTREMELY hard water in our area. I put about a cup of of my laundry scent concoction in each wash. (& yes, the salt dissolves in my washer at least.) Our clothes are left smelling 'fresh & clean' & soft. Everyone is left happy!\n\nBecause we are a large family, we blast through laundry products like crazy.

I store the 5 gallon bucket in my garage & just keep a smaller container in my laundry room.\n\nSo... there you have my long story about why I like these 'fresh & clean' smelling laundry scent boosters.

I am so happy to say this rug is wonderful quality and a decent price as well. I already have this runner in a larger size from a different company and wanted to put one by my front door to match it. I was worried that this wouldn\u2019t be the same rug-even though it appeared the same online. I\u2019m happy to say it is the exact style of rug from the same company(it says it is a \u201cMamluk\u201d rug on back) just in a smaller size than the one in my living room. Because it\u2019s in a smaller size the pattern is shrunk to fit the rug\u2014but it is beautiful. It really ties my living room together and adds a nice dimension and a somewhat traditional vibe.\n\nThe runner is not super thin nor is it super thick. I\u2019d think it would technically be considered low pile but it is a nice, thick quality backing. If you like to have some cushiness under your feet I would suggest buying a nice felt rug pad (30-50$+)Or in the very least get one of those netting style grippers. They make the rug feel a bit higher and cushion the feeling under your feet while making sure they don\u2019t slip or slide around (You can get them for $1 at your local dollar store! But may need to buy more than one as they don\u2019t usually come super long-but it\u2019s better than paying 25$+) You will also want to get either one of these pads bc this rug isn\u2019t lined with that rubber stuff to cause it to not slip if you happen to purchase a smaller rug or a runner. If you have a larger one you won\u2019t need to unless you want that cushion bc it won\u2019t slip around-it\u2019s too heavy.\n\nOverall this is a great purchase & looks amazing. It was packaged well and the rug has already begun to lie mostly flat after putting some books on the ends of it this afternoon. It came packaged tightly and securely.

I have already set up my label to get this picked up tomorrow for return.\nI have to say Amazon has made it very convenient to buy or return something sitting at your home which I greatly appreciate.\n\nI bought this rug after a long long search trying to find the right rug for my bathroom. This rug is not a complete disappointment but it did not turn out as great as I was expecting it to be. Here are my likes and dislikes.\nLikes:\n1. Size - This runner is 9 feet long with a width of 2 feet 9 inches. It was the exact size I needed.\n2. Price- Price is okay for the size of the rug.\n3. Washable- I washed it already once to get rid of strong funky smell it had when it arrived.\n\nDislikes:\n1. Thickness- It is very thin and I had to buy thick pad to give it some cushioning. A pad is a must for this rug otherwise you will fly off in a second and land on your ass the minute you step on it without thinking.\n2. Color- I have bought a yellow color. It is dirty yellow more or less like light brownish with a yellow tint. It is not as bright as it looks in the picture.\n3. Odor- It had funky smell when it arrived. Usually new rugs do have factory smell which goes away once they have been opened and laid out for a few days. For us, it was weeks in and it was still smelly. I had to finally wash using a rug shampoo. The smell diminished after that but it is still there. maybe another wash after a few weeks will get rid of it.\n\nOverall, I don't like this rug. The only reason I kept it since it is hard to find the dimension and the color I was looking for and my bath really needed a rug. This rug can do the job while the search continues for a better quality rug.", "While ideally I would only buy quality goods made of ecologically sustainable goods that could last as close to a lifetime as possible with responsible care, there are also times where I recognize that good rugs are expensive, and that rugs get ruined in my home because we have three house rabbits who will inevitably get bored one day and begin ripping out fibers or destroying the edges. Ironically, our rabbits do not like sliding around on hardwood floors, so my partner and I put large area rugs in every room so that they can count on secure footing. We learned the hard way that it never pays to buy good rugs, because they have about a two year lifespan in our home. This rug seemed a perfect choice for our living room, under a sofa and coffee table. It's the right size, the colors and patterning are aesthetically attractive, and it lives up to the expectations I had when viewing the photos. However, it is a cheap rug. The fibers are neither plush nor dense, it is not soft to walk on or luxurious to feel, and a moderately close inspection shows the synthetic material sparkle you see in acrylic sweaters. The rug was horribly wrinkled, creased, and distorted when I unrolled it, which made arranging furniture on it difficult, since it was far from flat. I left it for a couple weeks to see how much it would relax on its own, and was bemused to see that it barely did. So we moved the furniture off and I spent an hour steaming and ironing it through a towel, which got it to a version of flat that I could live with. This revealed that the edge is cut rather wobbly, and the margin is not consistent the whole way around the rug, but it looks nice until you inspect it closely, and will serve the purpose it is supposed to for some period of time. If it makes it longer than 18 months, I will be happy. If it doesn't, that's going to be because it its quality rather than the rabbits, and I will update this post and rating.", "I was pleasantly surprised by how pretty this rug is. I am a dog owner and don\u2019t feel the need to spend a ton of money on a rug I know I will eventually change out. I ordered the 10x13 in brown. The design and coloring are quite beautiful and it has so much more detail than I expected for the price. The brown can almost be mistaken for a grey, but it works and it\u2019s very neutral and the beige is beautiful. There are also hints of slate blue in the outer design which I find pretty. Like many reviewers have stated, yes it does arrive folded due to shipping restrictions. When I first laid it out, I was so worried about how many lumps and bumps it had. But within hours it started to flatten. I have now had it out for 2 weeks and it does still have small creases. I\u2019m not sure if it will ever lay completely flat. It is also a thinner rug. I can feel the hardness of the tile floor underneath. It is thinner than my old area rug but it is also about $500 cheaper. So I don\u2019t necessarily mind. If you are expecting a perfect, high quality rug, you will be disappointed. But if you are expecting to get what you pay for, you will be pleasantly surprised. There are a few very minor defeats but I received a beautiful large rug that my dogs seem to love. It works for us and looks great in our family room.\n(Two of the photos show the rug at night and one is during the day with natural lighting where you can really see the hints of blue in the design).", "This rug was a perfect color and thin in thickness, for what I was looking for in an area rug. The only set back was the folds in the way it was rolled up. I cannot get them out. Hopefully they\u2019ll relax with time\ud83d\ude0f", "I bought this rug in two different colors, one for my living room and one for my dining room. I would say both are more brown/beige accented than gray. I bought the teal one first, then when I needed to replace my dining room rug I bought the navy. Both start stiff but with vacuuming they soften up. Only a mild machinery smell, airs out pretty quickly, comes rolled up tight in plastic for shipping.\nFrankly I'm a young person on a budget with pets, I wasn't looking for something nice, but this rug has a nicer appearance than anticipated. Even my mother likes it. It's easy to clean, and I mean very easy. It is also very thin, if you wanted something to sink your toes into or keep warm this isn't the product you're looking for.\nMy puppy has had all kinds of accidents on it and no stains, no problems cleaning it up. Carpet cleaner, enzyme cleaner, Lysol, all been sprayed on it, it survives. Good cleaning and vacuuming soften it right up. If you got pets or are on a budget this will work for you. I imagine if you have kids this would be good for a play area with a thick rug pad under it.", "I liked your rugs very well. I was going to buy tree rugs with the same pattern and brown. But the two rugs that I got said they were Brown but when I put them down they were two different colored Browns 1 looked like a light brown and the other rug looks like a darker Brown. The darker brown Runner rug I put in the hallway I'm okay with. The other lighter rug I put in front of the steps the front door. I was wanting to buy a bigger rug for my living room but the dilemma I'm in is I want the living room rug to match at least the lighter rug in front of the doorway but I'm not sure when I get it if it will be a lighter brown or darker brown both rugs on the back said just Brown. My goal was to buy 3 rugs the same pattern same color and I would have been happy. So for that reason I am not too happy with the whole rug situation. When I looked at these rugs the only option I was given was brown .", "The rug quality is fine for the price. The color does not seem anything like the photo's yellow. It's more of a tan or taupe color. So disappointed, I really wanted the yellow to brighten the room. As others have said, their are wrinkles, due to the screwy idea of folding the rug (10x13) and then wrapping in plastic. Rolled rugs come out much smoother, and are so much easier to place atop a rug pad! I've been relying on it settling a bit, and am placing furniture etc on the rug, so I hope it helps, though others have said not. If the yellow in the photo provided had been accurate, I would have been over the moon with this rug.", "It was a tad too large and the wrong color.", "IT'S NOT THE BEST RUG OUT THERE, BUT IT LOOKS VERY CHEAP, THE PATTERNS ARE NOT EQUAL, SO IT HAS PATTERNS THAT ARE LARGER ON ONE SIDE OF THE RUG THAN THE OTHER.", "This rug is perfect for my room. I was challenged by the color and design I was looking for And this rug was what I needed to complete the look! I also thought the price was good too!", "The rug is not terrible overall. I just unpacked it and have noticed a few issues.\nThere appears to be a random hard white knot of fabric in the middle, around half of an inch long; I thought it was a piece of white lint at first and went to go pick it off. Unfortunately, it appears to be part of the rug and is rather conspicuous, once you know where it is. There additionally appear to be some loose strings or loops of stitching on the outside of the rug in a few areas. The loose strings are only an inch to three inches long. Hopefully this won't lead to any structural or fraying issues in the future. Also, it could just be an illusion, but it seems like no matter how I adjust the lighting in the room, one half of the rug seems lighter than the other.\nOn a good note, the pattern is nice and the color overall was relatively within expectations based on the photos on the product page. The carpet seems to be laying relatively flat for having just been unrolled.\nI do wonder if I could have gotten a better product at this price point. I will be ordering rugs for other rooms in my home soon, but I will have to decide whether I'd buy this brand again or try another.", "Love the color & pattern. It won\u2019t last forever but suits my needs at this time. Color is a light butter yellow & design has white, greige & tan. Perfect for my home. It did take awhile for run to \u201crelax\u201d but vacuuming helped as did placing furniture on edges that roll.", "The colors are good but just a bit darker than the pictures. I thought the weave looked cheap. You can see the backing through it. However, my friends and family said the did not notice that until I pointed it out. We ended up leaving our old rug underneath as padding. Would I buy it again? Maybe. It was inexpensive and the colors were perfect for the room. I might be a little more discerning about weight and weave next time.. It's not horrible, just not quite what I had planned out. If it weren't for the great colors I probably would have sent it back. Glad I kept it. I guess it's growing on me.", "Many reviews said its an okay rug for now. I needed a BIG rug to put under my 9 ft table. I thought,\u201dMeh!

Understand when you purchase, this is a thin rug that adds a little style while being a perfect price point! I got the yellow which is more of a golden yellow with tans and grays throughout.

Now the shipping was pretty fast on the sellers part so props to them. I am a young 19 year african american male. Since my first facial hair that started to grow in the 6th grade (yeah i know) i have tried everything under the sun to shave. my hair doesnt grow uniformly like i would like it to dod but it grows sparsely all over my face as a mess. i really hated it. It was such a depressing fact, comming from someone who dresses nicely but my facial hair would mess up the whole outfit.Sucks when youre trying to woo the opposite sex huh. Everytime i went to the barber for a complete haircut and shave of a shapeup it will begin to grow back on the beginning of the 2nd day. It was annoying and expensive to go get a shapeup once a week to control my hair.I bought an andis liner and it was pretty ok until the blade got dull and it wasnt as smooth as i wanted it to be as if i came from the barber Once i began to use electric and ESPECIALLY MANUAL shavors, here comes razor bumps. The multi- blade shavers are great for smooth looks and up close shaving but the irritation afterwards and ever facial killer razor bumps. it was disgusting! all over my neck and face looking like a mountain range! it was painful to touch and had to wait until it went away a week later while my hair is still growing. i hated. i was desperate, i tried nair on my face (disaster). i tried single straight blades, but had terrible technique, electric shavers are pretty expensive. and to be honest most shavers were made for caucasians,not minorities who really doesnt suffer from razor bumps. even the so called sensitive skin razors that wasnt much of a difference.\n\nso, i went on a google search and looked up on a solution for weeks. I finally made a search of \"bumpless shaver\" and was brought to this product. i checked on the reviews and seen other african american reviews and were happy i found something. but the pricing point and some of the negative reviews swayed me away for a week or too. after seeing my facial hair mess in the mirror, i decided to take a chance with this believe its my last option\n\nwhen i first used it i had my beard at the longest length thinking it would work. that first night it didnt do a thing. i was pissedd that i spent $50 on it. i read the manual and tried again, but once again no luck. i honestly believed that nothing would work. i immediately order for a refund and to send it back. due to work (thankfully) i wasnt able to send it back for about 4 days. during those four days i had an important event and went to the barber to clean my face up . on the morning of the 2nd day i saw that my hair was creeping out again. so i tried one more despearte attempt at this shaver. and it was as if god himself was cleaning my face. it was a miracle!!. the little stubble that was growing was gone. absolutely gone. i nearly had tears in my eyes when i saw this. but i did have some facial irriation to this shaver. i was terrified that my face was going to break out terribly because it was such a close shave to the skin and that spells out doom for my face. but nothing has popped up. Over the next couple of nights i continued to shave to prevent my hair from comming back and the irritation slowly went away as my face got used to it. i immediately cancelled my refund request and i will continue to buy this product once this one stop working.\n\nnow tips to other people:\n1) you cannot shave with a full beard and think that it was take it away. look on the holes on the head. it is way too small to fit a fully grown facial hair. its a maintainer not a shaver.\n\n2) also it is pretty noisy but unless you live inside a library, it shouldnt be that big of a problem to hear for less than 5 minutes a day\n\n3) yes yes you pretty much have to shave everyday if u want a clean look. this is for me, other people hair growth rate varies but if it similar to mine pretty much everyday once a day in the night or morning. but less than 5 minutes would be suffice\n\n4)this thing doesnt affect any detailed facial hair designs. i have a goatee and a strip of hair extending from the bottom of my head hair along my jawline to the goatee. it goes right past it without a hair shaved. keeps it tight and clean inbetween haircuts.\n\ni hope everyone enjoys this review and it answers your questions about this product", "I was advised by many to get this product and I\u2019m not disappointed! It gets me the baldness I want without the bumps or hassle !", "Best close shave ever. been using this in the military to avoid pseudofolliculitis barbae. This was a replacement as I had my previous one for almost 20 years and would still work fine if I didn\u2019t damage it by dropping it so many times. it actually still works but the blade is a safety hazard due to tactical shaving down range in a Humvee.", "work right out the box great job on my shave really close just right to hold in hand", "Absolutely the closest shave with an electric shaver thus far. That is the good. The foils are expensive and very brittle, that is the bad.\n\nI have had this shaver almost 1 month now, and have already gone through 2 foils (on my third now). If you buy this, BE SURE to buy extra foils also!\n\nFirst foil started to tear where the bottom meets the plastic shell after a little over a week. My first indication of this was when the shaver \"bit\" me while shaving. I'm like, \"OW! What the he....\" and there was a tear in the foil, exposing the cutting blades inside. Ouch. Switched to the spare foil I purchased separately. That lasted about a week and a half before I dropped the shaver (due to its incredible vibration and bad grip, totally my fault), and the foil was damaged beyond repair. Now on the third foil, and ordered more from Amazon. Always have a spare!\n\nAnyway, this shaver does use NiCd rechargeable batteries, and there is some special care needed with NiCd batteries. For starters, it is imperative that you charge this shaver before the first use. Yes, it will run immediately upon opening the box, but it is not good for the longevity of the battery. Plug it in and a bright red LED comes on to tell you it is charging. When the LED goes out, the charging is done.\n\nYou can shave for nearly a week on a single charge. And, this is important, because NiCd batteries like to be run all the way down before you recharge them. Unlike NiMh and Lithium batteries, NiCd batteries will develop a memory if not run down all the way and then charged all the way up each time. So, the 4th or 5th shave, the shaver will get pretty slow, and you may have to plug it in to finish your shave. Yes, the shaver will run off of the wall-wart just fine. It takes about 8-10 hours for a full charge.\n\nWhen the shaver is running, it is quite noisy. If you have to shave while your spouse is sleeping, you may need to go in the garage to do it. Compared to a rotary shaver, the Wahl 8061 sounds like a gang of angry bees into a microphone at a Rolling Stones concert. It is quite obnoxiously loud.\n\nThe best part is how close of a shave it gives. The Wahl does give the best shave by an electric shaver EVER. Almost indistinguishable from a blade shave. Seriously. Your face will get used to it fairly quick. I have had no trouble with ingrown hairs or skin irritation as reported by some.\n\nWhy not 5 stars? Noise! Also, the high cost of replacement foils, and the fragility of them. My shaver (purchased from Amazon) did not come with a cover to put on the foil when not in use, so I can't just toss it in the drawer, it has to stay out on top of the counter next to the sink when not in use so nothing accidentally damages the foil. That is a costly mistake.\n\nI paid full price for this baby, and I feel like it is a good value. Now, if you factor in the cost of the 3 foils I have gone through so far, it is not a good value. If the replacement foils were cheaper, then it would be an excellent value.", "I love how easy this shaver shaves me on a daily basis.", "Husband says this is the closest shave he\u2019s ever gotten with electric shaver.", "Foil is very thin. It tore off and tore my skin open.", "I am completely satisfied after using this product for a week. I have struggled for years to find a shaving method that provides for a close bump free shave. I have used clippers and other electric shavers, but they didn't shave close enough and as I got older the hair became more difficult to cut. I've tried hair removal powders which actually provided the best results BUT it was very time consuming and inconvenient which made it an unrealistic option especially as my life became busier. Then the creams which include the issues above and they were simply weak and left patches of hair. I finally said the heck with it and used a 5 blade razor. I just accepted that I would have to deal with razor bumps. But after stumbling upon this product, I no longer believe razor bumps must be a part of my reality.\n\nAbout the product: I finally bought it after reading the positive reviews by other African Americans and watching various videos, and there are some very good ones out there. I must say that it looks a lot better \"in person\". Sounds foolish but one of the reasons I didn't want to buy it was because I thought it looked butt ugly. For some reason the online pics don't give it justice. I charged it only once when I first got the product (~16 hours) and it is still going strong after a week. The only downsides are that there is no trimmer and it is loud. I have a trimmer so that's not a big negative but it would be a plus if they added one. Others have complained about the loudness and although I agree that it is MUCH louder than any other electric shaver I've used, it's bearable. As long as you can close the bathroom door you should be fine, otherwise you may wake up the family.\n\nThe shave: I know everyone is different and I am no barber but I'll share what has worked for me so far. I begin with washing my face with an exfoliator. Then I apply a thin layer of baby powder on my face to ensure my face is dry and allow the shaver to glide easily across my face. I begin shaving by pulling my skin tight while gliding the shaver over my face. I do not apply pressure and I move in an up and down motion in the same area until I can no longer hear the razor cutting my hair. Once I'm done I wash my face with a cleanser and pat dry my face. At times a little touch up is need with a trimmer (I have some very stubborn gray hairs). Finally I apply an aftershave balm and I'm done...looking as fly as a middle age man could be. I tried using it on my head but either I didn't have the patience to do a good job or I have too many nooks and crannies on my scalp because there were too many patches of hair. I will continue to use a 5 blade razor on my head since that works just fine.\n\nI definitely recommend it. After about 20 years of trying different shaving methods, I'm glad to have finally found the answer. Big thanks to Wahl for addressing the issue and providing an affordable solution. I don't know why they don't do more to promote the product.", "It did not get a five because it does not have the trimmer in the back like my original two shavers.", "I am relatively happy", "I\u2019m a hairstylist and I do mens hair for a living. I came in here to buy a new one if these. I wa dreading reviews for fun. I saw some video review where the guy held the shaver up to his fully grown beard saying it was working.\nHere\u2019s a tip: you have to use trimmers for take the hair down to almost nothing then use the shavers. It won\u2019t just work on long hairs.", "I had quite high expectations and it succeded them all!\n\nPerfect for either keeping a clean shave or removing stubb next to your beard (since it wont shave long hairs).\n\nMy only negative comment is that it didnt come with an EU charging cord!", "Best shaver in years.", "I owned this Shaver a few years ago and decided to switch to another brand because it had good reviews and because I was familiar with the manufacturer name brand.\nI'm glad that I returned to this Wahl Shaver because of its excellent performance. Although, it doesn't have a trimmer like the previous one I used.", "Writing this for bald men, Wahl will give you a very close shave similar to blades. Might feel some burn down at the back of the head. A downside I have noticed is that their foil wear out relatively quickly specially if you use it daily or every other day in my case. You may have to replace the foil every 6-8 weeks. Advice: check the shaver foil every time before you use it . Great shaver nonetheless.", "The shaver works very well. I had to learn how to use it. It is very different than the 3 spinning cutter shavers. It does feel like it is made of a delicate plastic. Not like your mom or dad's black electric razors of the 70's. I selected this shaver because it was made in the USA ( from parts made else where, china, perhaps?). Too early to tell about battery life. One negative thing is the packaging. When I picked up the box from the mailbox, the contents banged around. The item box was pkg'd ok in the shipping cardboard, but the contents of the product box, ( the razor, power supply) were loose. Even the protective shroud over the thin metal screen was off! All parts were ok, razor charges and works fine. Factory packaging needs a redo. My face skin did sting more using this razor compared to a blade shave. Lots of GRAY powder inside the razor head when I cleaned it. It was a combination of hair AND skin! I read the instructions before use. Do not push into your face, it's more of a glide around..learning curve. Very noisy shaver. I don't care, I'm pretty much deaf. I would buy this again!", "I've been waiting to get a Wahl hypoallergenic shaver for a long time. Finally I have one. I've used a number of electric shavers, Norelco, Remington, a couple of Brauns....and now this Wahl. I found immediately that you must NOT push hard on this shaver like you do with most of the other ones. I pushed a little too hard the first time I used it, and got a little bit of a rash. The next time....I took it easy, just as the instructions suggested, and let the shaver do all the work. What a difference....a smooth shave, almost as good as a regular manual razor.\nI'm very impressed with this electric shaver. It is powerful, and gives a great shave. I have only one complaint...no pop up trimmer. I can live without it, but it would be nice to have for sideburns. Other than that, this is a great shaver which is easy on your sensitive skin. I'd buy another one in a flash, and would recommend it to anyone with sensitive skin like myself. Buy one. I guarantee you won't regret it.\nAs an update to my review, I've had this razor for 3 years and the battery failed to hold a charge. The instructions stated that replacing the battery was simple, so I ordered one online. It was simple to open the shaver, but the 4 connections to the battery required snipping and re-soldering. Fortunately I had the proper tools and a little bit of knowledge on how to use a soldering gun. It took me an hour to snip and re-solder the connections, and now the shaver is charging the way it should. I would think the original ni-cad battery would last longer than 3 years, but it might be good for others to know that replacing this battery is NOT a user friendly task. I'm sure that if a professional shop did the replacement, it would cost half the original price of the shaver to get it done.\nOther than that, this is the only razor that doesn't irritate my skin, otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to try and fix it.", "Just started the replacement process because the razor came without the actual razor piece. It\u2019s supposed to be new. In addition to being unusable- looks like someone was in it- the inside of the box looks like it has lipstick stains or something. Pics attached", "To appreciate an electric shaver and all it will do you really got to know how to shave period. Like wet shaving pre-shave prep is important. Wash your face with hot water and a good \"Drying\" soap like Ivory. Do not,I repeat, do not use a moisturizeing soap. You want your face nice,dry and tight. When completely dry apply something like \"Lectra Shave\" and give that a few moments to work a bit. This will give the right lubrication needed. All this will make the hairs stand up stiff which is what you need.\nThen like wet shaving , shave yourself twice. The first go down along the grain, then up against it. Use fairly short strokes, don't \"Rub\" back and forth. Use mimimal pressure so not to cause razor burns. This thing's got some power to it (which is why it vibrates so much) and the foil is thin so it's easy to cause that kind of burn. Not necessary to re-apply and Lectra Shave.\nYou may want to rinse off any execess Lectra Shave with fairly warm water when done.\nI did all that and got probably the closest shave I've ever had wet or dry. It's really not that much of a hassel to prep.\nThe only drawback to electric shavers is, depending on what part of the country your from, this is strickly \"Winter Time\" shaving. When the air is cold and dry. Not very good in the summer when the humidity is high. You want a smooth flow along your face.\nAlso notice that the heads are not level with each other which is why you don't want to rub it back and forth. This is also probably the reason some of you are still complaining about getting burns and bumps. Don't rub with it and again, use minimal pressure, just guide and direct it, let the shaver do the work. The lower head is the one you want to lead off with.\nWhen all said and done it's probably a good idea to use some kind of after shave. Not the usual because of the alcohol content, you've probably dried your skin out enough with the pre-prep, but the treatment most old time shavers and old fashioned barbers recommend, WITCH HAZEL. This will sooth and give a little hydration back to your skin. You can most likely pick it up cheap at most dollar stores, in where the rubbing alcohol is.\nThis review is not intended for those who know how to shave, just some handy hints for those who may want to know a different way that may help. I'm 58 and have been doing this for a while with all kinds of different shavers.

Baby girl had 0 issues with Luvs both during the day and night.\nBaby boy worked well with Luvs during the day and night until he started sleeping the entire night. The Luvs still did their job overnight to the best of their ability, but there for several days we were waking up to leaks, busted diapers, and wet jammies. We found absorbency for the overnight diaper was the key factor so we do diaper with a different brand for the boy overnight. Regardless, save yourself some money and buy these if you like.

They also tend to have more blowouts than other brands (I've tried 3 other brands). But, blowouts don't happen often enough to cancel out the good price. So, meh! These are fine but not the best, it's whatever for the price.", "I purchased these diapers after searching online for \u201cbest overnight diapers\u201d and seeing them in a list of highly rated leakproof options. After opening the first of two boxes, I was disappointed by a few things I didn\u2019t expect:\n\n\u2022 The back of the diaper is not elasticized, so the diaper has to be closed very tightly to keep the back close to baby\u2019s skin.\n\u2022 The front tabs do not extend to cover the sides, so I ended up having to really pull the Velcro tabs to get a good fit. This meant that on my daughter, the tabs were sitting really snugly on her thighs, and I worried they were cutting into her skin.\n\u2022 The diapers are truly paper thin, although this did not seem to affect absorbency.\n\u2022 The material is rough, unlike other brands which are softer with more cushion.\n\nI was indifferent to the scent, although it\u2019s definitely stronger than one might expect for a product intended for babies. Not entirely sure if this is healthy for a newborn.\n\nIn terms of absorbency, these held up shockingly well. We have had no leaks in the last 3 days of trying them out, and several diapers were very heavy when I changed her, so I think that\u2019s a good indicator of how much they absorbed.\n\nMy first issue with these diapers is that they really are too rough for my one month old, especially considering how snugly I need to close them since there\u2019s no elastic back and the front tabs are so short. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s comfortable to have a tight, papery diaper on her delicate skin.\n\nThe dealbreaker here was that the flat back that totally fails to keep her poop inside (which is after all the actual point of a diaper). The first (and last) time she pooped in one, it went all the way up her back and into her shirt. I\u2019m now using these diapers strictly during the day, and only when I am pretty sure she won\u2019t be pooping again. For the poop issue alone, I would not use these overnight, which was why I bought them in the first place. Despite the low price, I\u2019ll be sticking with Huggies for the fit or Pampers for the softness.\n\nAs an aside, I question whether or not the 5-star reviews on this item are legit. When I sorted for the most recent 5-stars reviews, they were all just a few lines long and incredibly vague. I\u2019m just not convinced such a mediocre item could have so many satisfied customers.", "They are a good value. I will say they are not very good for overnight diapers. They do tend to leak if you do not change the diapers overnight. And when they get too full it\u2019s almost like the diapers start to dissolve and get these white balls. But if you change your baby regularly then these diapers are great.", "They did a good job.", "I can help believe the incredible deal I've found here with these! 252 diapers for $33?! That's unheard of! I am SO happy for these. The diapers themselves are perfect for my young son. Very absorbent, a line turns blue when they're wetted & I haven't had one single leak.

The added the wet indicator. Finally, they are somewhat comparable to biggie and pampers. They are as soft as Huggies or pampers. I believe they are just as absorbent as name brands. They provided great leak protection, especially at night. Mostly leak proof. Unfortunately, you can't help the blow outs. My daughter for the most part wakes up dry in the mornings. They fit nicely around her thighs. Easy to pull tabs. They do pull off to readjust the band. Luvs are the most inexpensive brands. I didn't buy them because they weren't as soft and they didn't have the wet indicator line. I was so happy to see the indicator on the front and back. My only complaint is I wish they were as soft as Huggies or pampers. If you are on a budget, these are great diaper. I recommend these and will continue to buy.", "Love them!", "I'm using Luvs for both my kids, ages 2 1/2 and 9 months. As far as quality goes, they're acceptable to very good, depending on when I use them. They're perfectly fine for changing every 2-3 hours during the day, and I have never had issues with rashes. I've had issues with overnight leaks with every single diaper I've tried, including the ones specifically marked as \"overnight,\" and these are no different--occasionally one or both of the kids will wake up with some leakage.\n\nThe recommended weights for size 3 and up, however, seem way off to me. I had to switch Kid #1 to size 5 when he hit about 19 pounds (the recommended size is 27+ lbs). Kid #2 moved to size 5 at 17 lbs. Neither of them are big babies or toddlers--one is on the smaller side, the other right in the middle of the BMI chart.

These are cost effective diapers and work almost as well as the high $ brands. The difference in cost in my opinion is not worth the leak protetion, durability or ease of use. Loves has great protection they will last with your kids running around playing until changing is needed. Over night protection is just as good as well.\n\nDont waste your hard earned, tight budget money for diapers that are way over priced when loves are just as effective.

Here\u2019s my experience with them after one week.\n\nI\u2019ve been using many different earbuds over the years - Bose, Samsung, Apple, Sennheiser, Sony, etc., and am active in the gym every day, putting any earbuds through hell. Biggest reason I wanted to try these is for freedom of the cord - I can't tell you how many times I've accidentally ripped earbuds out of my ears in the gym or while running. It's infuriating, but those days are GONE.\n\nThe Samsung IconX's are a valiant 1st Gen effort by Samsung.\n\nEASY MODIFICATION (see pictures):\nLet\u2019s go through this first. For me, the basic provided rubber earbud tips always seem to put pressure on my eardrums, which is very uncomfortable and can be painful. Also, I can never seem to get a great seal, so all low-end frequencies are non-existent most of the time. The only time I could get a somewhat full sound with the provided earbud tips was while laying down doing push-ups - probably because of the way they were situated. Once I stood up, they lost all sound quality.\n\nSo, I purchased the  Comply Premium Replacement Foam Earphone Earbud Tips - Isolation T-400 (Black, 3 Pairs, Medium) , and modified them slightly to match the original earbud tip size. The material of these earbud tips allows for MUCH better sound isolation and frequency response. I cut 1/8\" off each with a razor blade (very easy to cut through) and popped them on. NIGHT AND DAY difference. I could now hear the full spectrum and the seal was almost perfect. You'll have to experiment with what size works for you, but Medium seems to have done the trick. Sounds isolation is greatly improved with these as well, so you can focus on the music without effort. Also, they don't fit quite as nicely in the charging case, but certainly good enough, and the case shuts fine with a little extra pressure. See images.\n\nThe IconX's are now worth keeping.\n\nSOUND QUALITY:\nThis is an interesting one, because we're relying heavily on Bluetooth to handle everything. Surprisingly, after the above modification, the IconX's sound great. I've used them for 6 days in the gym, running, sleeping, working, etc. I'm hearing things that I haven't before using past earbuds, better high-end response than a few wired earbuds I have, but of course not close to a good pair of wired headphones. My current reference headphones are my  beyerdynamic DT 770 Pro 80 ohm Studio Headphones , and, while the IconX can't compete with these, I'm surprised on how well they handle certain low frequencies after modification. I do hear distortion at higher volumes, and I do wonder what type of compression is involved, as it competes with the music sometimes, but it's subtle enough to disregard.\n\nBUILD QUALITY:\nImpressive. These have a nice weight to them, no moving/loose parts, and fit nice and snug in the provided charging case. The overall shape seems to wok very well with most ears, so I think Samsung has done a nice job here.\n\nBATTERY LIFE:\nJust OK. Yesterday, I used them (fully charged) in the gym for about an hour and fifteen minutes, and they started to die. It'd be nice to get a solid two hours out of them while connected to bluetooth.\n\nSOFTWARE:\nLimited right now. One gripe I have is that the IconX's won't recognize folders of music in the internal storage that I've copied over. They force you to just dump songs in one main music folder. This needs to be fixed with a software update. I really need to be able to organize my music by playlists, so when I'm running I can listen to certain songs at tempo, etc. So, I'm not really happy with the way music is stored internally. Maybe I'm missing something?\n\nTOUCH CONTROLS:\nOverall these work very well - they're just too big. It's very easy to advance the song, raise volume by swiping either direction, pause songs, etc. But, due to how large the touch surface is, it's very easy to accidentally send a command without wanting to. For instance, if I take one out really quick to talk to someone, it usually causes me to accidentally pause or skip a track. This can be frustrating, but I think Samsung could possibly issue a software/firmware update to allow users to lessen the active touch area. I think if they reduced it by 30%, it would be easier to manage accidental commands.\n\nPROS:\nComplete, wireless freedom\nGreat sound quality (with above modification)\nBuild quality and solid construction\nPrice - I actually think $199 is pretty reasonable for 1st Gen\nCharging case - works perfectly, and can charge the earbuds several times\n\nCONS:\nBattery life when connected to Bluetooth\nTouch pad is too large and sensitive\nProvided earbud tips degrade sound quality\nNo playlist configuration - can't save folders\n\nOVERALL VERDICT:\nThere's so many good things going with these, and once you realize that you have completely wireless music, you'll wonder why you've been dealing with cords all this time. It's really a game-changer. I'd recommend to buy them, along with the above Comply Earbuds Tips, and put them through some their paces. I bet you won't look back. I haven't tried The Dash by Bragi, but with the IconX's being $100 less, it was an easier decision to make.\n\nFour stars. Samsung should provide additional foam earbud tips (like many other companies) so people like me don't possibly give up on them too quickly. Also, I'd recommend Samsung really work on updating the music-organization software to allow users to use playlists. We have to have these.\n\nThanks, Samsung for a really great product. They're with me wherever I go.", "These fit a crucial niche for me, but might not be for all users. I don't like carrying my phone with me when I go running- it's too heavy and clunky for my running shorts. I run on rocky trails, so using a bluetooth ipod isn't realistic either, as I really shouldn't take my attention off the trail. These earbuds fit my needs PERFECTLY. They're lightweight and unobtrusive; they charge relatively quickly (a 10 minute charge will usually get me through a 45 minute run); I can adjust the song and volume with a tap of my finger without taking my attention off the trail. All of that being said, they're not perfect, but they're pretty close and there's virtually nothing else like them on the market (I found a similar pair with integrated mp3 player, and those are far less consumer-friendly). Here are my PROS & CONS\n\nPRO:\n-Small & lightweight, no cords or separate mp3 players to stow\n-Controls are relatively easy to learn and use\n-Good sound\n-Nothing else like it on the market\n-Beeps (if you're listening) when your battery is running low, gives you plenty of warning if you need to listen to a \"power song\" before they run out of juice\n\nCONS:\n-Runs well on a full charge, but doesn't seem to hold a charge from day-to-day (I wind up charging it in my car each day on my way to run)\n-Controls are pretty good, certainly better than any competing products, but are still occasionally frustrating. A drop of sweat will occasionally pause a track. A triple-tap (restart song/ go back a song) sometimes registers as a double-tap (forward one song). Increasing volume sometimes tricky. I find I have a harder time if I try changing volume or going back a few songs while I'm still running/ bouncing around\n-I could never enable the pass-through sound\n-I'm sure there's a way, but I couldn't (on my mac) arrange a simple playlist. Usually I would drag/drop songs, and figure out later where they went in the playlist. I would recommend a short playlist for this reason- longer ones are tougher to navigate, and I couldn't line up a sequence of power songs. Also, each earbud can be either the master or slave, but I never figured out how to switch them (so I put the same music on each earbud's memory).\n-People don't always see you have earphones in and will still try to stop you/talk to you\n-Mine died unexpectedly! No damage, they just stopped accepting a charge.\n\nAnyway, the bottom line is that they do have some limitations but are still perfect for my niche use. If you aren't going to use the integrated memory, I would suggest other less expensive products. As it is, I'm buying a new pair to replace the ones that broke (I'll probably be able to charge old pair in the new pod).", "These headphones are really not worth the cost in my honest opinion (At least not yet). When I first put these into my ears, the sound quality was not that good. It does get very loud if you turn them up but the rich tones and bass were less than desireable. I put the largest tips on in hopes that it would isolate more but to no avail. A while back I had purchased the \"Comply Premium Replacement Foam Earphone Earbud Tips - Isolation T-400\" for some other earbuds that I own and decided to try these on the IconX. when I put them on the true sound came through and it was absolutely fantastic. The bass was great and the rich tones were all there. The problem with using these however was that they made the earbuds stick out further from my ear which in turn caused them to intermittently shut off and turn back on plus they wouldn't fit back in the charger with these on. Also, the touch pad on the earbuds was so sensitive that I was barely able to adjust these in my ear without accidentally starting a workout or changing the song/volume almost every time.\n\nI was super excited about these when I bought them thinking that for this price I would be getting one of the best truly wireless earbuds out there but unfortunately I was mistaken. I think the potential is definitely there but they need to go back to the drawing board and fix these issues before I will even consider buying another pair. As a comparison, I have the \"Simger Beats Wireless Sports Earbuds\" that were purchased for $70.00. These have amazing sound and for the money are a much better purchase. Also, they will last between 3-4 hours listening through bluetooth unlike the hour or so you are expecting with these. (One note is that they do tend to cut out in one ear every once in a while but it is only for a second and that's still worth it to me)\n\nI am a very loyal Samsung fan and will continue to be. Please work on these issues so I can give the next model a go as I truly did like the look and feel of the earbuds.", "By no fault of the sellers, I would like to say I'm not entirely satisfied with this product. The battery life is too short, and it's definitely not made for talking for long periods of time throughout the day. However, my original purpose of this purchase was to get me through my day at work. I work in a warehouse setting. We are allowed to listen to music or talk on the phone, but we can only have one headphone/earphone in at a time. For me. I just use one for 2 hours then switch and let the other one charge. To which I get just that, about 2 hours before the earpeice allerts me and says 10% battery life left. Also, one part that is annoying is that you have to go into the app to switch the main earphone(left or right) to which you must have both in in order to switch the main one. I find this annoying as It seems that If the other one isn't nearby, you'd think it would recognize that the main one is the one nearby(seeing as I leave the one I am not using in my locker on the other side of the building).\n\nThe sound is great. And my boyfriend says he can here me quite well, so, I am happy for now. Until the newer ones with a bigger battery life comes on the market, these will do.\n\n#Update,\nafter using these for a month, I have noticed that I can't seem to get a good and comfortable fit. I keep trying, and keep thinking if I just play with them a bit more then I will find the perfect fit, but I just cant see to get a comfy one. Either the bud sits uncomfy and I get decent sound, or I get a loose seal get terrable sound, and it sits comfy. I wish I had just returned these when I had the chance. Not at all satisfied.", "Got my earbuds last night. After wearing the buds throughout the day I must say I am so happy with my purchase. I love them. They're a little tricky to work at first but once I kept using them I finally got the hang of them. They are very comfortable too.\n\nThe battery lasted about 2 and a half hours while playing music and Netflix from my phone. I read that the battery life is shorter when playing music that is stored on the iconx. I have yet to test that out. To charge it was very simple and pretty fast. I kept popping them in to charge as needed.\n\nI don't love that I have to insert both buds in my ears for them to connect to my phone, but I get it. I wear them in the office so I need to be able to have one ear free for calls. It would disconnect when I pulled out one of the earbuds, but then I figured how to remove one gently without disconnecting. This was why I didn't give it a full 5 stars. Although it's not a deal breaker since I know the purpose is for exercise and not to wear while at work.\n\nThe ambient sound mode was strange but very cool. I was lightly tapping my desk and kept wondering what that sound was I thought it was in the music, but then realized it was me lol. the tapping sound was emphasized, but not overwhelmingly loud. It wasn't muffled by the loud music. Hard to describe but I like this safety feature. I like that I can walk and workout without worrying about not being able to hear whats going on around me.\n\nOverall this was a great purchase.", "Got it and was excited to try it out and take it to the gym, only to find I had a defective product. The right earbud wouldn't fully charge or synch with the left one and also unable to get it to synch with my S8 phone. Went through the manufacturer and Amazon customer service bith with the user manual and by phone, only to have to return it and order another one, this time from a different seller. Hopijg the new ones will work right when I get them.\n\nWhen I got the second pair, it looked \u201clike new\u201d indeed! It appeared as if the package had never been opened. Immediately charged up, paired with my phone and worked properly. I\u2019ve used them in 3 separate workouts and they work great! They stay in my ears and no worries about \u201csnagging cables\u201d or, more importantly, fall off like wrap around the neck Bluetooth headphones have been doing. Ambient sound leaves a little to be desired, but works great with music at lower volumes. I was worried about driving as I only use a single ear approach, but that proved to be moot, so long as the main earbud (see instructions) is selected for the ear you want to only use one earbud in. Sound quality is pretty decent. The only major negative I have is that the \u201ctap menu\u201d on the earbud can be finicky- I hit play next track and it plays previous track or sometimes pauses. Usually when battery power is low. Also, when only using one earbud, the other earbud can work and the tap feature is function, which can cause music to pause or so forth.", "Here's my experience with these... Depending on your usage, experience, and accompanying devices, your experience may differ. I loved that they combined a lot of my needs into one; earbuds, mp3 player, and heart beat monitor. I'd been waiting and waiting to get something to do all these things and was so excited to try these.\n\nI was under the impression that being at least fairy tech savvy and having both a pc computer and apple phone/ipad that my bases would be covered. Not really. These work best with Samsung phones or at least Android.\n\nI was also hoping I wouldn't need software to put my mp3s on there. I do need the software. Even though it's pre-installed on the earbuds, since this is a new product my virus scanner promptly quarantined it. I had to dig it out and restore it to the earbud. It's too bad about the technical end for me; I'm sure people with Android/Samsung Phones will have a better time with these. I'm still working on finding a heart meter app that will work for me with my devices and these.\n\nThe charging case is excellent. The lights always let me know what's going on with them. The fit of the earbuds is also excellent. I'm really surprised how comfortable they are and am able to lay down in them comfortably. There's even lots of extra cushions to last me some time. The controls are also easy to work because the instruction booklet made it really simple. They paired and synced no problem!", "Samsung introduced a pair of truly wireless headphones, before any other major competition would be able to bring in their take. These headphones are truly innovative and are the bases of future headphones I'd like to use. Samsung's take on in ear style wireless ear buds, makes me feel like Joaquin Phoenix in the movie Her. The concept is very futuristic. The charging capsule they arrive in is not only simplistic but also sturdy and serves several purposes. The build quality is very much Samsung. It is plastic, yet oddly feels quality. The ear buds are quite light, even when in their charging capsule. The fit of the design, is very much within your ear, but stick out very little. The ear tips are adjustable and seem to have a good seal from outside noise, but would ideally have a better quality, if they were memory foam. The overall sound quality brings a good feeling of Samsung moving in the right direction. They are loud enough to use as sport ear buds, and are able to be used in loud environments such as outdoors or at the gym. I feel they sound comparable to the Samsung level headphones and offer a good mix of Highs, lows and mids with a somewhat flat and shallow sound. The touch controls are responsive and offer a few features, that may or may not be necessary. I have owned several headphones and was looking for a pair of truly wireless ear buds that I could take anywhere in my pocket. These serve that purpose and more. The only major downside, in my opinion, is the poor battery life they seem to suffer from. I would like to eventually own a pair that would last me more than a few hours, like when I'm streaming media or watching Netflix. I would recommend these for someone active, looking to leave the frustration of wires, and offer a good pair of ear buds for short uses. Other wise, I'll be waiting for what new improvements and additions the wireless ear buds market has to offer in the near future.", "Along with the Gear IconX, I own the Samsung Gear Circle and the original Samsung Level Bluetooth earbuds, but I like these the best. I use these mostly for workouts, which is what they are intended for. They sound as I expected, and there is good bass for it's small size. The heart tracking feature is great during workouts, and I have found it to be very accurate (\u00b13 BPM). If you go running, the ambient sound feature is very useful, as it allows you to be aware of your surroundings due to the ambient sound being played along with the music. In ambient sound mode, the music is still easily heard and is still clear, but you just hear ambient sound (this mode can be toggled off). I also use this mode if I listen to music but still want to hear and talk to somebody.\n\nYou may have heard complaints about the battery life. I believe there is plenty of battery life for any realistic workout length. Just make sure to put them in the charging case after you are done. The case itself has a battery, and can charge the pair of earbuds about 3 to 4 times before needing recharged. One thing to remember is to dry/clean the earbuds before you put them in the charging case. If you continually put them in the case wet, the charging cantacts are at risk of corrosion.\n\nOne other thing I loved about these earbuds is that they stay in your ears! My Gear\nCircle Bluetooth earbuds used to slowly slip and fall out of my ears. When you put these in right, they DO NOT fall out, ever!\n\nIf you're someone who uses MP3s, you can put MP3 files directly on the earbuds so you do not need your phone or smartwatch to play music. When using the earbuds in standalone mode (no Bluetooth connection, only the earbuds), it can still track your workout duration, distance, and heart rate.", "These would be fine, but the battery life makes them useless. When linked to your phone, you get about two hours of life out of them. You can double that by using only one at a time, but it isn't as simple as putting the used one back in the charger, and putting the other one in your ear. In order to switch which headphone you are using, you need to open up the Samsung Gear app, and switch from there. BOTH headphones need to be in your ear and have battery life in order to do this. The whole process takes about one minute to do the swap. That doesn't seem too bad, but when you are exercising and have to stop what you are doing for over a minute, it gets frustrating. If the headphone you are using dies before the swap, you CAN NOT use the other headphone, even if it is fully charged.\n\nThe battery case that holds the headphones and charges them doesn't have great capacity either. It can charge both of the headphones once, but it quickly loses charge over time. If you fully charge both the headphones and case, unplug them, and try to use them 24 hours later, all three batteries will be fully drained. So, the only option is to leave it plugged in at all times when not in use, but the documentation specifically warns you not to do this, because it will wear on the battery over time.\n\nAlso, if the case's battery dies, but your headphones both have a charge, the headphones sometimes won't turn off if you store them in the case, because they think they are still in your ear, meaning they will continue to drain their batteries.\n\nI've used multiple different $10 cheap Chinese wireless headphones from Amazon, and ALL of them were better than this.", "This is very good sports earbuds. I was easily able to connect them to Lg phone, Samsung gear fit 2, Kindle Fire HD8, and Asus tablet. It was very easy to put music in the earbuds memory connecting them to Windows 10. I had other company (Rowkin) earbuds and it was impossible to use them outside because of disconnecting problem. This earbuds are solidly built, comfortable, do not fall out and keep connection to each other and to the source of music very well. In fact, I went snowshoeing with them and they performed perfectly. Just playing music from the earbuds memory will take about 3 hours or more to drain the charge. The quality of music is fine for working out. It is not for listening to music for music's sake. I think they are great earbuds. I am happy.\nUp dates:\nI used these buds for walking outside many times with a hat on (if it matters) and they never dropped connection to each other or to the LG android phone. I even used them with Samsung gear fit 2 and they worked fine. They last me about an hour without trekking function. They may last longer, but I did not check. I am still happy.", "I am sad to say that out of the box these earbuds have been a huge disappointment. First time out using them on a bike ride I turned my head and they just 'drop' disconnect and music stops. Now, I am not talking about disconnecting from my phone, but I was using the internal storage to listen to my music. In the first 10 minutes they must have disconnected at least 6x's. So you can imagine I was not happy. I road for 90 minutes and they dropped one more time when I dropped my head forward. WTF?\n\nSo, I charged them again last night and went for a run today. First thing they started dropping left and right. Then for the rest of the run (about an hour) they dropped a couple times. It's almost like they need to warm up and then they don't drop as much.\n\nNeedless to say these are going back. Perhaps I'll try again on the next iteration. Be aware for 200 bucks I expect more. Perhaps they are a bad pair, but still first impressions are everything.\n\nI am a big Samsung fan and have an S7 and many other sammy products. However, this product has issues. Good luck!", "I'm always sceptical about believing online reviews, especially ones that say they got a discount, so on that note, I did not get a discount for purchasing this product.\nThese headphones are exactly what I was looking for. Truly Wireless headphones that I can listen to bluetooth streaming music on my phone while at work and wearing only one bud at a time while the other bud is charging that way I have continuous battery power throughout the day.\nPros:\nCan charge one bud while listening to the other\nYou can set left or right bud to be the main receiver\nVery comfortable, especially after switching the outer rubber ring to the smaller size\nCons:\nWhen streaming through bluetooth the battery only last about 1.5 hrs\nYou have to remember configure the main ear but when the current bud reaches 10% battery or it doesn't have enough power to complete the switching process\n\nOver all feelings? Best headphones I have ever owned", "For the most part, I am happy with my purchase. The earbuds make it so much easier to listen to music while working out and running. They never fall out of my ears, the music sounds good, and I love being able to track my exercise and heart rate using the earbuds. However, sometimes they hurt my ears after wearing them. It's a little difficult to get them positioned in my ears just the right way. And sometimes the touch pad doesn't work as well as I like. But despite a couple of downfalls, these were a really great purchase.", "I bought these earbuds for ease when I run as I didn't like corded earbuds but I'm finding that if I go for a long run(45minutes or longer) I need to bring additional ear buds as these drain very quickly. They do not last anywhere close to what was advertised and it's disheartening as I love them but cannot trust them if I'm running or even working out in the yard for an extended period of time. I bought these in December so I'd figure they'd last longer but unfortunately that is not the case.", "This product is excellent. Samsung did a fantastic job designing it. It is true that the battery life is substantially lower than the competition but these are fitness buds for the gym not everyday use. Any gym gower knows that a typical session is 1 1/2 to 2 hrs. My workout is 1 hrs cardio while streaming you tube and 30 mins weight training while listening to the on board music. With more time to spare. If you are a gym fanatic pick them up.\nPros:\nLight weight and small.\nNo wires\nGood sound quality\nAccurate fitness tracker\nCase charges the headphones\nCompact\nFits securely in ear and never falls out\nLoad music on the go\n\nCons:\nCould have more battery life.\nIf you leave headphones in the case for a few days without use the case will loose it's charge over a few days leaving the headphones without a full charge.", "I ended up sending these back becuase the battery life max I could get was around an hour and 15 minutes. I walk for around an hour and a half and they kept dying. The sound is great. I read several reviews about the sound being ok but lacking and I disagree. Your phone has setting to adjust so set them to your preferrnce. If the battery life was around during 3 hours these would be a home run. Very good fit in your ear.", "The only issue I'm having is battery power. They show charged and say charged fully when i connect them, but die within an hour of use. I can not even get through a whole workout. I have only used them twice now. But...I love the convenience of them. They fit in my ear perfectly. I have not had any issues with controlling them. Very user friendly. They work perfectly with all my workout aps.", "I had several concerns before purchasing. I looked, read reviews and watched videos. After I received them I found out several neat bonuses. The case doubles as a charger , the earpieces can work indepent of each other. I would love to see and app developed that you could use it as a hearing aid. People have given me excellent audio reports during phone calls. The Music that you can store on them is an extra bonus.\nI have no negatives about them. I was worried that one would stop working or if you lost one then you couldnt use the other. After using them I have walked around the house with just one piece in and it worked great.", "For the last several weeks I've had the Motorola Verveones plus. They are very good and in some ways better than these. I have a few gripes with the Motorola which include they hurt after awhile, but my main complaint is the right ear bud will loose connection for about a second every few minutes and is random. These fit well out the box for me with the medium ear cushions. I can shake my head and they don't come out. I haven't paired them with my Samsung Note 7 yet but I did with my iPhone. Audio quality is good but not great. I mean they are good for a pair of wireless earbuds first generation though.

The last one I had was a similar looking but different manufacturer and got stained SO quickly and badly I had to trash it after a few months. NOT this one!! This one has gotten a lot of foot traffic and dropped food but it's stayed in tip top shape. Still looks new and food cleans up without a problem. I'm honestly shocked it still looks as good as the day I bought it. It's held up unbelievably well. Had for 6 months now.", "Love this rug. I am super picky and I couldn\u2019t be happier with this purchase. I was super surprised about the quality!", "Beautiful & looks like an expensive oriental rug.

I decided to give this rug a try since I was redecorating my office on a budget. I ordered the gray 6x6 - although my item said I would not have for a week, it was shipped and delivered within 3 days. The rug is low pile and surprisingly softer than I expected. It is true to color, pattern and size. If you are house decorating on a budget this rug is perfect. I gave it 5 stars based on those qualities, I can not speak to cleaning or how it holds up overtime. I would recommend and would order again.", "This is my second rug I\u2019ve purchased from Unique Loom. Both have been great\u2014when you factor in the price, I am yet to find a better, more quality product. The weave is tight, the materials soft, and finding something comparable would easily cost me 2-3Xs more in a store. I have bought other rugs online, but this is my go-to company atm.", "The rug is not the thickest rug, but it is thicker than I thought it was going to be. After unrolling it, it feels super nice to walk on.

Love the pattern: rich and vibrant colored yet variations so doesn't appear stark. Loved so much I bought the runner in same -pattern!", "EXCELLENT product. Very vibrant colors. I use it as a kitchen tile floor runner. With a good quality under pad it's perfect. Those customers who think it's too thin may not be using a non slip pad under it. Easy to clean, expecting it to be very durable.", "A good price for a nice rug without any obvious flaws. It isn't amazing, but at the price that shouldn't be an expectation. I use it to keep a computer chair from marring a wood floor, and it has proven quite resilient to fairly constant rolling around on it. The colors are even in the design, and the pattern is nice (though this is subjective) I'd happily buy it again", "La Jolla is a pleasing, non repeating, black/gray/white pattern...soft but very short pile...I'm using 3 pieces as trim around the perimeter of a bedroom...nice \"background\" effect is shoes and furniture tend to blend in, so do not standout as they would with a solid color rug or floor...also using a 6\" round rug under a round table in the front room", "Beautiful carpet and perfect for the location", "This rug was a great price for the size, wasn\u2019t expecting much...

My only gripe is that it's pretty thin. I bought it to put under my new papasan chair for my bedroom, and it was intended to protect the wooden floor from being scratched by the chair. It's so thin that I can feel the wood floor underneath perfectly, and I worry if it disintegrates at all from the weight of the chair that it'll end up scratching the floor anyway. For the price I'm willing to replace it eventually, but just something to keep in mind. I bought a slight variation of this rug, same color, from the same company, and it's significantly thicker for whatever reason. I'll probably just replace it with that model when it comes time to do so. Again, it looks and feels nice, but it's definitely on the thin side.

LOL!\nOkay, bare with me, this will be a detailed, in-depth, review! Which I don't do often, but this deserves one! Because I have so many things I love about this serum & her products in general! ...\n\nFirst let me state, it is clear & liquid, like a water consistency! Do not be put off by this! This is a good thing. You just add one dropper's amount into the palm of your hand (using clean hands) and with both hands pat it onto all of your face. (Clean face)... It absorbs really easy & quick! Feels very light, as if nothing is there. Not sticky or thick! Which is why it being like \"water\" is a GOOD THING! Because after this serum, you want to be able to apply moisturizer, sunscreen, and/or makeup - without difficulty! It wont ruin or clash with the products you go in with afterwards!\n\nI have EXTREMELY sensitive skin! I have to take allergy medicine daily to avoid hives. I have Psoriasis on my elbows & my hairline on the back of my neck. Certain products can make my skin turn red with a burning sensation... Other than certain actual Perfumes, I can not handle fragrance in any of my skincare/hygiene products... It's just, yeah, like I said EXTREME - how sensitive my skin can be.\nHOWEVER!!! This stuff does not hurt my skin! My face handles some of the Paula's Choice products I've tried so far, really well! I love that it targets my skin's issues, without any irritation (if used properly) ... I know not everyone's skin is the same, but my sensitive skin handles this particular serum just fine, without any problems!\n\nI also want to compare this product to another expensive brand I've tried, \"La Roche-Posay\"...\nWhen they were shipped to me, along with Paula's Choice products at the same time, La Roche-Posay's serums came with damaged product boxes & no seal! Their serums are not cheap! So you'd think they could package their stuff better & seal them! It also made me question if they were used, rather than new... On top of that, I did not realize until after they all arrived, that La Roche-Posay's serums all have unnecessary fragrance in them! Not Cool! It made my skin flare up & my skin was irritated as a result! That's when I realized the crap like fragrance... So I stopped using their stuff & continued forth with just my paula's choice & first aid beauty products only!\nThe Paula's Choice products I bought were all packaged well, no damage, & it was clear they were all new! And they have no fragrance! So I will never buy serums from La Roche-Posay again, and just stick with Paula's Choice! Im not gonna waste tons of money on another expensive brand like that, if I can trust THIS ONE more!\n\nI also know Paula's Choice products are working, because the results were surprisingly FAST! I have never had a product work so quick before. I was shocked, in a very happy way! I have combination skin. Where some areas are oily & some are dry. With hormonal acne, blackheads on my nose & chin, acne scars on my cheeks & forehead, & visible pores... Or at least I did, prior to this stuff! It made my skin feel evenly soft! Moisture in the dry areas, yet not oily! It evened-out my skin, it feels like. My blackheads & pores & acne are all clearing up & way less visible... Just WOW! Left me speechless, honestly! I expected to go through that adjustment phase, where you breakout until your skin gets used to it. But no, I guess I got lucky, because it just immediately started working. I can't wait to see how clear everything is, with more time & more use!\n\nI want to note that I use First Aid Beauty's face wash as a cleanser, First Aid Beauty's Retinol under-eye cream at night, and First Aid Beauty's face ultra moisturizer... HOWEVER, other than that, I am using Paula's choice products (This serum specifically! That dark grey bottle of \"Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid Exfoliant\"... and the light blue bottle of her \"Resist Weightless Advanced Repairing Toner, Niacinamide & Hyaluronic Acid\") and when my First Aid Beauty's moisturizer is gone, I plan to give Paula's Choice brand of moisturizer a try, to see how it works too! I have fallen in-love with this brand, which I do not say lightly; and because of how well it works for me so far, I feel like I will become a new loyal/regular costumer! The reason I mention what brands I am using together, is to help express what all was used to achieve my awesome results!\n\nI do use SPF 30 moisturizer in the La Roche-Posay brand (if Im gonna go outside or be out of the house) but it is unscented, and that was why I originally thought I could trust their serums, until that epically failed for me, because their brand of serums are fragranced & caused my skin to react badly!\nSo kudos to Paula's Choice for NOT being fragranced lol! My sensitive skin thanks you!", "I was looking for 1 product to use after cleansing and before moisturizer, then sunscreen. I have rosacea and wanted an all inclusive anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory product packed full of soothing ingredients for redness and irritation but also a layer of protection against UV. Niacinamide, panthenol, allantoin and other ingredients do all that in this 1 formulation. Caused some redness at first-lasted about 10 minutes then faded away. No stinging or burning-but I also apply a layer of Cerave Moisturizing Cream or Cerave Night Cream (not lotions) over the top immediately after the Paula\u2019s Choice dries down (about 30 seconds later). And I never let my skin become dehydrated whether using this product or not-it\u2019s much more reactive when dehydrated. After consistent 2 months of use my skin is calm with no redness after about 5 minutes. I don\u2019t have the patience or the interest in a multiple step routine. Cleanse, Paula\u2019s Choice Niacinamide formulation, Moisturizer. Done. In the morning I let that sit for half an hour, apply sunscreen, lip balm sunscreen, done. Very happy with this product targeting my concerns re rosacea.", "I have oily skin and the skin for my face loves niacinamide . Unfortunately, my skin didn\u2019t love it . My skin after using this product got really try and my skin felt very tight . Maybe for someone with a different skin type this product might work but it wasn\u2019t the case for me", "Not bad", "I'm very into skincare and really care for my skin. I use CE Ferulic, HA Inensifier, Tripeptides....the whole gamut.\n\nI've tried this and realized it's not even 3/4 of an ounce and was gone in 3 weeks. For the money, no thanks. I'll keep researching.", "I bought this mainly to help shrink my pore size. I use it about daily every night but unfortunately I'm not seeing any changes after one month of using this. Giving it 3 stars because there weren't any adverse affects but I also don't think it helped improve anything for me personally. I won't be purchasing this one again.", "I ordered my first bottle through Paula's Choice website and within a week I could see a difference in the depth of my pores and elimination of redness on my cheeks/nose area. Pore size never truly changes (without some derm work - laser etc.), but the appearance can change. I was surprised and thrilled! I use this every morning and evening, and sometimes during the day as a lip moisturizer.\n\nOne thing to pay attention to: if you combine this with a vitamin C serum, you could get the dreaded niacin red flush. It is NOT an allergy or irritation, it is just a red flush that will go away in a few hours. It took me a full 5 days to figure out how to use the AM without the flush occurring 2-3 hours later at the office. I use this without Vitamin C serum in AM but a Replenix brightening boost instead. In the PM I don't care about the red flush while I'm sleeping, so I layer this after my toner and follow it with my C serum and other serums and moisturizers. Highly recommend! Just work with it to find the way it best works with your skin. (Note: there are plenty of reviews where skin doesn't not react well to it - acne and swelling. Some skin might not be able to handle this. If you can, however, I highly recommend!)", "Highest concentration Niacinamide I found. I think it also has vitamin C. Niacinamide has been shown to decease shin cancer by 26% and blocks cross linking of collagen fibers that cause wrinkles. Retinoic acid does this also. Niacinamide also reduces the redness and burning caused by retinoic acid. It can take 6 months to see much effect by either of these drugs, but they do work. They are even better as a prophylactic. Things that can cause or increase wrinkles are smoking and Sun. I really need to do a review in 6 months and 1 year.\nThe biggest problem I have had is that the bottle is empty at 5 weeks after using only 3 drops per day. The bottle is white and u cannot see the volume inside. Label says 20 ml and at 3 drops a day it should last at least 6 months. I will contact Amazon and the manufacturer. I will still order another bottle but measure the amount in it before I start using it. Also I use an equal volume of facial SPF 30 cream and mix the 3 together before applying to face. I used to not put retinoic around my lips or lower eye lids because of redness, but adding the niacinamide eliminated it. Also all this should be applied at night and I would also use SPF 30 facial cream mix especially if using retinoic acid because u can get a burn with retinoic acid and sun. If u get a burn inspite of using tha SPF30 then just wash it all off in the morning and apply the spf in the morning. Also u could just use the niacinamide alone for a year or so and do before and after pictures. If it only prevents worsening, that\u2019s well worth it. Good luck.", "This clears redness, tightens pores, smoothes bumps, & helps clear pimples. I have crazy sensitive skin & this has never irritated it in the 3 years I\u2019ve been using it. I use this everyday, twice a day. It goes on clear & weightless, almost like water, and blends perfectly with my SPF in the morning & lotion plus retinol at night. Sometimes I use Paula\u2019s Choice 20% Niacinamide at night instead, but not sure if I really need the higher strength\u2014 except maybe over a breakout specific spot. This stuff is amazing.", "Product is like water and very hard to apply. Expected it to be more like serum consistency.", "It\u2019s been past a few weeks of using this product. It definitely cleared up a lot of dark acne spots from my face. You have to keep using it for more time because yes it did clear up significantly but the changes are not drastic at about 3-4 weeks into using it. Overall if it wasn\u2019t so pricey I would continue using it but because of the price I will switch to another niacinimide hopefully it works like this one. As for the consistency it feels like water. And for the smell now this is something you\u2019ll want to take note of IT HAS A WEIRD SMELL THAT YOU CANT TAKE OFF YOUR HANDS NOT EVEN MY WASHING THEM. I\u2019ve been told I have a sensitive nose so I can really smell it.", "I love this product! I had small partially inflamed hard bumps and lumps along my jawline for the last year. I was happy to hide it under a mask. I thought it was some kind of skin disease & I'd need laser treatments. I tried this product as a last resort and every single bump just disappeared! For real! I was astonished. I can't tell you when exactly. It was over a couple weeks. One day I looked in the mirror and they were gone! It has a water-like consistency. Don't let that fool you! It's potent! I made the mistake of buying something cheaper with a higher % but it didn't work . So I'm back and never leaving! Bumps gone! Pores smaller! Skin smoother and tighter! Redness started clearing overnight! I highly recommend!", "It gave me more pimples.", "I love this! I had a purging phase for a couple weeks but even during that, my skin has literally never been better. Oil is no longer a problem, pores are smaller, and skin seems tighter in addition to a more even tone. I just absolutely love it. It is liquid unlike The Ordinary\u2019s which is popular but the consistency of that breaks me out (not purging). Anyway, at first I used too much. After some experimenting, I found that for me it\u2019s best with four drops mixed with my moisturizer at night. 10/10 I love it.", "It has a moisturizing watery feel. Did have a little sting at first. But I think that it has made a difference within just a week.", "I normally buy this product from the PC website (cause they always have deals) but I wanted a faster shipment and I knew Amazon was the best option for me! I absolutely love this product! It not only reduced my pores but it dried up the little acne that I had. It absorbs fast, is very light, and it feels great on the skin. I definitely recommend.", "I can't say enough about how much this has improved and saved my son's skin! He had terrible acne all over his face and he was starting to scare from them. I started him on this about 2 months ago and the improvement from just 2 months is a miracle. The scars faded and his skin is clearing so much. He still has a few break outs here and there but not like before. He is more confident and is enjoying adding this to his skin care routine.", "Expensive", "I liked the way my skin felt after using this. Unfortunately this broke me out though, this was the only new addition to my skin care regimen and I very rarely break out. I've tried a few other niacinamide serums with a shorter ingredient list that were more effective than this, and this is too expensive for the very minimal results.", "This seems to work well with other serums and under moisturizers.

This grey runner is soft and just the color I wanted.", "I wasn't expecting a super-nice area rug for the price, but this is a bit lesser quality than I expected. The 4stars is because in the low-use area it is sitting it, it does well. If I needed a rug for a high traffic area I would get something a bit nicer. The colors are nice and match a larger area rug in my house that is thicker and does well with more traffic.", "Overall I really like the rug. I wanted something simple yet with a classic look. I definitely would not say it is \"navy\" in color, more like a denim jean. You can compare it with my dark navy pillows on our gray sectional. It is a little darker than what the picture shows. The rug is very soft and we have two pads underneath (bought at Home Depot) as this is in the family room and my kids (plus husband) are playing and wrestling on it daily). We've had it for about 3-4 months and parts are already getting the matted-down feel.

The gray was an elephant gray and the cream was not too yellow. I ordered the largest one and it did come folded and rolled which I was initially concerned about upon receipt. It was easy to unwrap and laid very nicely . It is heavy enough that I did not need a non slip pad. Although I may add one later since it is laying on a hard wood floor.

In fact, I just put the 10 foot runner in my cart.", "We have this under our dining room table. Its been 6 months and it still holds up without a problem.

It is not a solid color, it has light and dark shades of brown in it, which is nice for not showing dirt like a solid color. It does need a mat under it if you put it hardwood floors, it does slide.

The adhesive is focused more towards the center of the liner, and not the outer parts where it\u2019s needed the most. It stays put throughout the day, but it moves around during the night.

It matches the aqua accents I have strewn about the room, and my kitchen backsplash (yes, all in one room). I'm hoping the edges flatten out completely in the next day or two, so I can avoid tripping on them. I agree, it's not plush soft, but as long as my dog is happy, and my feet enjoy it... Not like I'm going to take a nap on it or anything. Oh, and for the price! Gotta love Prime Day (notice my new vacuum in the top right of the pic? :))", "Beautiful!!! I was leery about purchasing rugs online, especially for the sizes that i was ordering. I bought a house that had been updated with new hardwood floors, and i really just prefer carpet. It was going to cost $6000 to carpet my 2,000 sq foot home, once i paid for carpet, pad and installation, plus, it would ruin the brand new floors, and if i were to sell, buyers may prefer hardwoods, or may not like the color carpet i chose. I decided to look into getting the carpet cut into room size rugs at the big box home improvement store and then just have the edges bound. It was going to be $2 per sq foot plus the cost of binding the edges. So i said, i wonder if amazon has room size rugs, then i wouldnt have to have the edges bound, and also wouldnt have to be trying to haul carpet from the store to my house, which since i dont have a truck, wouldve been another cost. Im so thrilled that amazon had the bold colors i wanted (purple for most rooms, teal for another), had the different sizes i needed, even the really large sizes for my master bedroom and large living room (12x15). I had some concerns though. I wondered about the quality, the appearance, and the ability to vacuum, and the vacuuming concern was two-fold, due to i have 8 animals, and i have a kirby vacuum. The kirby vacuum is very powerful, the most powerful vacuum you can buy, and even though there were reviews of being able to vacuum, no one stated they had a kirby, and i was concerned that my vacuum would have too much suction and not be able to glide over the carpet easily (if you try to vacuum a small bathroom rug with a kirby the vacuum will latch onto the rug and not let go), and also, whether the carpet would be durable enough to be able to use the beater brush, because with my animals, suction only was not going to be sufficient to collect all the hair/dander. Im so pleased to report that these rugs are able to be vacuumed no problem with a kirby!!! Do keep in mind that i am referring to the larger room sized rugs, (8x11,9x12,10x13,and 12x15), and that furniture is sitting on the rugs. If you have a smaller rug, with no furniture securing the corners of the rugs, then you may experience difficulty. But as for me and my experience, these rugs were no different than vacuuming any other carpet. As for the appearance, the shag is dense, just as pictured, and i do not have any bare spots. It is true that if you separate the shag fibers, you can see the backing. But you shouldnt be doing that!! With normal use, there are no bare spots seen, it looks just as the pictures show. I paid $1000 total, including tax, for all the rooms of my house, which is waaaay cheaper than what i wouldve paid for carpet installation, or if i had them cut carpet and bind the edges at a home store. Plus, i have two added benefits, if i move, i dont have to leave it behind, so i dont lose any money, aaaaand, if i ruin one of the carpets, i can simply replace justvthe one, instead of having to rip out a house full of carpet and plus have to pay someone to remove and reinstall.. i think buying these rugs is one of the best decisions ive ever made. I can say i will never pay for installed carpet ever again. Room size rugs are definitely a more convenient way to go. Also, on a side note, i ordered a wrong size and was unable to cancel one of the rugs. I contacted amazon, they arranged for ups to come back and pick it back up, and even waived the return shipping charge, and i received a full refund. Do keep in mind that i bought $1,000 in rugs, so that may have been the reason for their kindness. As another side note, if i wouldve had to been out of pocket for return shipping, it was going to be a charge of $24 which i think is actually a reasonable amount so if you do need to return it, its not as big a deal as other reviewers thought it might be. On a last note, do keep in mind, that for the same size rug, some colors were cheaper. There was no rhyme or reason for it, some colors were more expensive in one size, but cheaper than the other colors if you chosea different size, so be sure to check all sizes and colors you might be interested in. For example, i got the 12x15 in teal rather than in purple because for 12x15 teal was cheapest. But for the 9,x12 size, the purple was cheapest. And i dont mean just a few dollars, i mean cheaper by like $150, so check all colors and all sizes forcthe best deal at that time... Im so happy about my new rugs!!!! Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!", "It is a yellow carpet. Exactly what you expect.\n\nSmelled a little weird in the first couple days, almost like glue.

It initially had a few \"rolls\" in it but quickly smoothed out.\nVery happy with my purchase.", "Beautiful rug and it was soft. Colors were vibrant and as pictured. But the color was not what I needed so I returned it", "I was looking for a large piece of \"art\" for my carefully curated kinda vintage-eclectic [emphasis on 'eclectic'] bedroom project. I decided it might be kinda funky to hang a rug on the wall instead. The bed is enameled a darkish orange, trim is all orange, ivory, white, black, brown.\n\nAfter much gnashing of teeth, I thought this might fit pretty well, so risked the order, given how inexpensive it was.\n\nI'm nothing but pleased with how it works hanging on the wall - it's almost matted and framed in the way it's woven.\n\nHonestly, I don't have to qualify it with the \"for the price\"; although \"for the price\" makes it an even better value for me.\n\nIt did come out of the wrapping pretty stinky (dye odor, not overpowering \"chinesium-scent\" of manufacturing odor), I was in a hurry to get it up, I should have hung it outside for a day or two. But putting the HEPA filtration system under it on \"turbo\", and opening the window, it was aired-out in 24hrs hanging there.\n\nI started off with four stars clicked, but I just gave it five instead. The one thing to be aware of - mine was true to the photo the seller included. Much darker on one side than the other, but otherwise symmetrical. For me, that works fine. The dark \"anchors\" it on the low side, moving up to the lighter side. Look at my second photo, or the seller's photos, and look for the transition of saturation. Once you see it, you can't \"unsee\" it, and it would have bothered me a bit on the floor, lowering the score a star or two.", "It's beautiful. However there is one random long line going down the rug of pink and blue stitching:/ rug is too big for me to go through the hassel of exchanging. I do really love the rug overall though and would still recommend!", "This rug is stunning, it's hard to believe I paid under $60 for it. I needed a rug to fill the space between the kitchen island and main counter. There were only a handful of rugs available in the 10' x 3' size that fit the bill for my application. I am so glad I chose this one. The blue/teal color really makes the rug stand out, it appears in different shades of teal blue from different angles, very cool. The rug arrived in perfect condition, well packaged. I reverse rolled the rug after unpacking it, then laid it out and walked over it a few times. The creases and folds were all but gone in no time. This rug is comfortable to walk on and stand on, it's not thin like some of the cheap rugs out there. High quality, great look, cheap price. What more can you ask for? Buy it, you won't be disappointed.", "Looks goid", "Overall I like this rug. It\u2019s super soft so sitting on it bare leg doesn\u2019t itch at all! The only down side for me is it\u2019s not as bright as the image so it don\u2019t quite match my other oranges, but it\u2019s growing on me. I did notice that it off gassed for the first 2-3 days and gave me a little headache, but I was able to open the windows a little to air out my place.", "This rug is absolutely beautiful it is very soft. The color is fabulous and looks so rich and luxurious!\nIt is everything and more than I expected, especially with such a low price tag, it most definitely is a great value for the money I paid.\nI\u2019m very impressed and so are my friends.", "I did not like the smell. I\u2019m not sure if it was the dye.", "Online this rug looks I guess more rustic...and in person it's a bright purple, and looks more digital. It took me getting used to it to appreciate it. At first I was like \u2026 O_O ...whoah this is way too bright for my liking. But now it's sort of grown on me and I can dig it. Though it is sort of thin and with my dogs running around on it, it rolls up in various places...which is strange since I have a tv and an electric piano on it. I would think both heavy objects would keep it in place, but not so much. To flatten out the edges I placed heavy objects all around and left them there for a few days, and since removing them I have not had any issues with the edges curling up. Overall, I think it's worth the money.", "The color is prefect, the size exactly what I needed. I was a little disappointed in the feel of it. It seems there is some type of finish on it that makes it hard to vacuum, almost sticky. I assume this will go away with wear. I was happy to see it laid flat on the perimeter within a week or two, unlike other rolled rugs I have purchased.", "It arrived quickly and the packaging was great. It smelled really weird when I first got it, but the smell is fading. It\u2019s soft on the actual carpet part but the edges are kind of scratchy. Beautiful color. Over all amazing for price.", "Real BANG \ud83d\udca5 for your buck, also it is such a pretty green.\nHowever, though I\u2019m rating 5 \u2b50\ufe0f My 4 month old often wiggles herself off of her mat and onto the carpet, and as expected, she gets carpet burn. If you have infants or toddlers and need something padded I\u2019d suggest yoga mats or a puzzle mat for underneath!", "It's a rug. Just wanted to leave a picture of how great it looks!\n\nI'm not having any issues with it sliding around. So I haven't bought any of those undercarpet anti-slide mats. Great quality and color. I will keep this rug for a long time.", "I ordered this rug as it looked like a great fit for my living room. It was perfect! I have a sage metallic green accent wall and this matched perfect. Its a lime/yellow shade of green & has some dark brown color markings in it too along with cream. The quality is very nice. It's thin but soft. You might need a rug pad under it.

It is a bit lumpy at first, since it's been wrapped, but I'm waiting for that to even itself out. The colors were exactly as portrayed on the website. This rug is nicely plush, but lightweight enough that if it just lay on it's own, it might slip when walking on it.

Finally, we invested in two rolls of two inch wide industrial strength Velcro.

It's not available in any stores near me so I'm glad to find it for a reasonable price on Amazon.", "I love this shampoo! It cleans without stripping my hair of moisture.", "I only buy this now..", "Smells amazing but leaves residue in my hair.", "This colorless cucumber and green tea shampoo is included in the bio-renewal segment of this brand\u2019s hair care line. This specific shampoo is designed to provide sheer moisture. The formulation is PH balanced and paraben free but does contain sulfates which help create luxurious lather but also strip moisture from hair. This product appears to have included other ingredients known to moisturize, like aloe, to help counteract the harshness.\n\nI am pleased at how relatively easy it was to comb my hair after shampooing, something, depending upon the shampoo, I struggle with because my fine curly hair tends to easily tangle. Rather than follow my usual routine I used no conditioner so I could evaluate the sheer moisture attributes. The shampoo left my hair soft, but a little frizzy and although it looked fine, it was not as shiny as usual. For reference, I do not color my hair.\n\nThe fragrance is very light and while I can identify the cucumber is muted and is skillfully blended with other scents that create a very pleasant result. It dissipated almost immediately after my hair was dry and is more generic than geared toward masculine or feminine, so it should work well for all.", "Though it suggests using this shampoo 21 days to see results, I am not sure why. Shampoo doesn't stay on the hair long enough to do much deep penetration, but I suppose I could be wrong. I'm reviewing based on using it a few times and after 21 days if I see better results, I will be sure to come back to relay that in an update.\n\nThe biorenew shampoo lathers well. Though it advertises a really nice scent, I wasn't so enamored of it - it was so slight, I couldn't detect much of a scent; that was a little disappointing to me as I expected something very fresh- and clean-scented that smelled \"green\" and cucumbery. Herbal Essences I thought were known for their really nice scents that filled the shower and made you go Yay!, so this one, as I wrote, was a little disapointing.\n\nRinsing the shampoo away, my hair had that \"squeaky-clean\" feel to it - and felt a little thicker feeling. I do have baby fine hair, so this is a plus. But I don't notice a really great shine as I'd like--it looked rather dulled a bit, and the next day my hair doesn't look as clean as I'd expect it to. That could be my environment as I'm visiting the Deep South where there is more pollution and humidity and dust from high traffic than there is on my mountain, so when I go back home and use the shampoo, I'll be curious to see how it reacts to my hair, and I will update this review to reflect that.\n\nI like the idea behind this shampoo so I'm going to keep using it once I'm back to my mountain. As for my hair color (highlights and lowlights) it does indicate that it's color safe, but my highlights looked dulled compared to the shampoo I was using. I don't know if this is the shampoo or something unrelated, but there is a difference to my hair I'm not excited about.\n\nIt is supposed to be for oily hair and fine hair, so since I particulary have the second, I want to give it more chances, but not sure about it, honestly.", "Herbal Essences Biorenew shampoo has a light smell that is pleasant to the nose out of the bottle. It lathers well when I put it in my hair, and washes out clean. Out of the shower, it still maintains the faint smell of cucumber and green tea, which, as I said, it pleasant, but not overwhelming. My hair feels cleaner and softer than before I got in the shower. I have used this brand before, and have enjoyed it in the past. They have added \"bio: renew\" to this line which has aloe and sea kelp to gives stronger and more natural buoyancy to your hair. I am not 100% sure this is just lip service, or if it in fact does this. Overall, of the number of different shampoos out there that all claim similar results, for the price, I would probably reach for this brand again.", "I've always been a Fan of Herbal Essences. I love the way they make my hair feel/smell everything. And the Bio Renew Sheer Moisture Shampoo is no exception. I naturally have pretty dry thick curly hair.

It lathers nicely and is actually clear colored. I like that it contains 0% parabens, which I have heard are bad for your hair. I did not use a matching conditioner but rather used a different brand.

I do not have to condition as much, which I have been using a conditioner after I shampoo and another leave in just to comb through my hair, which looks like regular hair but is more like that soft, long hair on dogs.

It's not an overpowering long lasting scent that leaves your hair smelling like cheap perfume soap. It's a natural scent that is just the right combination of ingredients that's fresh and invigorating. If you like cucumber and the smell of lilies that's what you'll smell most of. I know it features sea help and green leaves but I can't really detect that scent that much.\n\nThis shampoo has left my hair looking shiny, moisturized, and rejuvenated.

It's not available in any stores near me so I'm glad to find it for a reasonable price on Amazon.", "I love this shampoo! It cleans without stripping my hair of moisture.", "I only buy this now..", "Smells amazing but leaves residue in my hair.", "This colorless cucumber and green tea shampoo is included in the bio-renewal segment of this brand\u2019s hair care line. This specific shampoo is designed to provide sheer moisture. The formulation is PH balanced and paraben free but does contain sulfates which help create luxurious lather but also strip moisture from hair. This product appears to have included other ingredients known to moisturize, like aloe, to help counteract the harshness.\n\nI am pleased at how relatively easy it was to comb my hair after shampooing, something, depending upon the shampoo, I struggle with because my fine curly hair tends to easily tangle. Rather than follow my usual routine I used no conditioner so I could evaluate the sheer moisture attributes. The shampoo left my hair soft, but a little frizzy and although it looked fine, it was not as shiny as usual. For reference, I do not color my hair.\n\nThe fragrance is very light and while I can identify the cucumber is muted and is skillfully blended with other scents that create a very pleasant result. It dissipated almost immediately after my hair was dry and is more generic than geared toward masculine or feminine, so it should work well for all.", "Though it suggests using this shampoo 21 days to see results, I am not sure why. Shampoo doesn't stay on the hair long enough to do much deep penetration, but I suppose I could be wrong. I'm reviewing based on using it a few times and after 21 days if I see better results, I will be sure to come back to relay that in an update.\n\nThe biorenew shampoo lathers well. Though it advertises a really nice scent, I wasn't so enamored of it - it was so slight, I couldn't detect much of a scent; that was a little disappointing to me as I expected something very fresh- and clean-scented that smelled \"green\" and cucumbery. Herbal Essences I thought were known for their really nice scents that filled the shower and made you go Yay!, so this one, as I wrote, was a little disapointing.\n\nRinsing the shampoo away, my hair had that \"squeaky-clean\" feel to it - and felt a little thicker feeling. I do have baby fine hair, so this is a plus. But I don't notice a really great shine as I'd like--it looked rather dulled a bit, and the next day my hair doesn't look as clean as I'd expect it to. That could be my environment as I'm visiting the Deep South where there is more pollution and humidity and dust from high traffic than there is on my mountain, so when I go back home and use the shampoo, I'll be curious to see how it reacts to my hair, and I will update this review to reflect that.\n\nI like the idea behind this shampoo so I'm going to keep using it once I'm back to my mountain. As for my hair color (highlights and lowlights) it does indicate that it's color safe, but my highlights looked dulled compared to the shampoo I was using. I don't know if this is the shampoo or something unrelated, but there is a difference to my hair I'm not excited about.\n\nIt is supposed to be for oily hair and fine hair, so since I particulary have the second, I want to give it more chances, but not sure about it, honestly.", "Herbal Essences Biorenew shampoo has a light smell that is pleasant to the nose out of the bottle. It lathers well when I put it in my hair, and washes out clean. Out of the shower, it still maintains the faint smell of cucumber and green tea, which, as I said, it pleasant, but not overwhelming. My hair feels cleaner and softer than before I got in the shower. I have used this brand before, and have enjoyed it in the past. They have added \"bio: renew\" to this line which has aloe and sea kelp to gives stronger and more natural buoyancy to your hair. I am not 100% sure this is just lip service, or if it in fact does this. Overall, of the number of different shampoos out there that all claim similar results, for the price, I would probably reach for this brand again.", "I've always been a Fan of Herbal Essences.

For reference, I have light colored skin (blonde/blue) and this tinted moisturizer surprising was perfect for me. I was expecting the cream to be runny like a lotion with next to no pigmentation, but I was wrong. It is a bit of a thicker, cream like texture and is highly pigmented, yet light in weight. It dries nicely not leaving a tacky, shiny finish. It worked very well at hiding my redness and as a light foundation/concealer under my eyes too.

I got him a facewash too, but he mostly uses this. \ud83d\ude44 he takes it with him when he goes on work trips, and asked me to order him another one for when he forgets it at the in-laws(which happens often).

I was recently diagnosed with rosacea, along with having Cystic Acne. My dermatologist actually recommended this. At first it was just a night treatment while I dealt with my acne treatment in during the day. But when my acne and rosacea combined I had a prescription gel for the acne/rosacea in the evenings and this moisturizer in the day. So it's not just for night time! It's any time you need that moisture boost! Also, I had my step daughter try it on her undiagnosed rosacea, it calmed her redness in 15 minutes, not gone but a noticeable difference.

Obviously, I ordered 4 of them in total. You can't beat the price and overall the rug looks really nice. It's a pain to flatten and to get all the folds and kinks out, but if you work it enough, it'll happen. I'd recommend giving this rug a shot if you're thinking about it.\n\nPro's:\n- The price is nearly unbeatable, especially for the size. I ordered (2) 8x10's and (2) 6x9's and to get a quality 8x10 rug for under $100 is nearly unheard of.\n- Nice image quality. From a distance, the rug looks great. Beautiful pattern giving it a nice, worn-vintage look.\n- Arrived quickly. Every rug I ordered said it would take four business days and it always took two. Bonus!\n- Low odor. Not bothersome, but aired out quickly enough.\n\nCons:\n- A pain to flatten out. 3/4 carpets came with FOLDS in them, which is kind of a pain to work out. Lots of \"kneading out\" and use of weights and other heavy objects, but eventually it does the trick.\n- Up close, the design looks very \"pixilated.\" You can probably see from a few of my close-up shots. This doesn't really bother me because even though I'm a stickler for details, I'm not going to be staring at my rug up-close, but it might bother some people.\n- One of my rugs came with what looked like bird poop on it. I noticed some other reviewers mentioned this too, so at least I'm not going crazy. It's disappointing but returnable, so not a huge issue but quite inconvenient to have to send something so big back.\n\nOther note: I drove myself crazy looking at images of the rugs trying to get a sense of true color. This rug has a sort of \"light/dark effect\" depending on which way you are looking at the rug (photo example #2 and #3). From one direction the rug has a lighter, softer gray coloring but if you walk to the other side and look at it, it's a darker, charcoal-ish gray look, so quite literally- the rug looks lighter or darker depending on how you look at it.

We have used this for several months and then suddenly when school started, couldn't find it ANYWHERE locally. Tired of one more thing being added to the out-of-stock, supply-chain-issue-list, we turned to Amazon. It was a little more expensive, but worth putting it on subscription for automatic delivery and not having to search all over town for it next month. My granddaughter was 5 when we first started using it. It was a battle every night getting her little ADHD body to settle down for sleep and not get out of bed 5X because she \"hated sleep\". We started by cutting the gummies in half and as she grew and turned 6, increased it to a whole one. It's not to say she sleeps through every night, or sleeps in, in the mornings...she's still up at 5:30a most mornings and has nights where she wakes up at 2a or 3a wanting a drink or a snack - depending on how much physical energy was expended during the day, BUT at least everyone can go to bed on a happy note and get some much needed rest.

I personally don't feel this is something to take daily as we only have these on hand for the really impossible evenings. I will ask them if they want one and if they say No, then they don't have to have one.\n\nThat being said, these gummies are all natural, non habit forming, and work wonders! Within an hour of taking one, children and gently off to sleep for a full night's rest. As long as it's available, we intend to keep this in our bathroom supplies.", "I read reviews recommending 1/4 gummy for little ones.

I took the advice of other reviews and gave her quarter of a gummy (0.25mg). Well it\u2019s been 10 days as she has gone straight to sleep every night!

When it comes to certain laundry loads such as children's clothes or sportswear, you want your detergent to eliminate bacteria that can cause illnesses and create lingering bad smells. But detergents alone don't actually kill all bacteria. Introducing Lysol Laundry Sanitizer, an additive specially designed to kill 99.9% of bacteria left behind. Simply add Lysol Laundry Sanitizer to your rinse cycle. It does not contain any bleach and even works in cold water so is safe to use on most fabrics including whites, colors and darks.", "reviews": ["I was going to get rid of my bath towels because of the smell they would get after washing them like when you leave wet laundry in the washing machine for a day or more because you just forgot about them.

Works great on linens and dog toys!", "I was unaware until 2021 that my laundry detergent was in fact not sanitizing my clothes and when I tell you I about puked and died. This has since been an additive- follow the marks on the top :)", "When using this in laundry, I use the soak cycle first with Lysol Laundry Sanitizer. Then wash like normal, using my normal detergent and fabric softener. Kills odors from my daughter leaving her laundry in the washer and them souring. But it is key to soak them in the sanitizer first. If not, as soon as your sweat you'll smell the sour again.\nPlus I got an amazing deal on Amazon! Much cheaper than I can in the store for the large bottle.", "I recommend this especially if you work in the food environment .

It feels like there should be some kind of guard on it. Nope. I finally just said \"screw it\" and dove in since I was sick of my legs looking like a cactus - its 100 degrees out today and I want to wear shorts and a swimsuit without prickly chub-rub.\nThis is what I found... Waxing is one big strip o discomfort... this little device makes you feel every hair as it screams for its life embedded comfortably, and in my case deeply, in my legs and nether regions.

After a while of being in pain I will just start to laugh (its a defense mechanism I guess) .\nWhen I got to that point he just left me alone.\nDid I mention I was doing this on my back deck?? (don't worry we live in the woods) because I realized that there is no place for the hair to be stored so it falls onto the floor like the needles of a dried up Christmas tree and the dogs were getting too nosey.\n\nAt any rate - it took SEVERAL passes and I had to force myself to slow down. Places I thought would hurt were not bad (top of toes - back of knees) Places I knew would hurt (knees, top of bikini area - the very private in-between) they hurt but never to the point where I had to stop.\nWhat is nice is that I could control where I was going and how far in I was going... with wax, once its on... tough toenails - ya gotta rip it off. I liked the control. I also like that I can do this for about 1/6 the cost of a single wax job round my way (if I'm not doing it myself) with no sticky mess and now I own this hair eating machine.\nI also like the fact that I can bust this thing out with no effort and do the touchups. I am not smooth as silk - I think I will need to use this consistently to get that - but it's a good start and Ill keep going.\nIt is clear subsequent uses will be much easier and less painful.\nI will never use this on my pits as I am way too sensitive there. I may also still wax the starfish because my flexibility isn't what it used to be and this thing requires a decent angle and the ability to stretch the skin whilst using it.\nOverall - its done its job with tolerable pain. If you can take waxing - you can take this. If you have never waxed and this is your first go with ripping your hairs out... you are in for a treat but its almost better because its self inflicted and allows more control over the surface area.\n\nI can update concerning longevity after I use it several times.\nGood price - Works well - Will save you $$ in the long run if you keep up with it.", "This thing is fricken great! As a woman with PCOS, I\u2019ve been shaving and waxing for a long time. I\u2019ve been using Flamingo wax strips for a couple years now but I can\u2019t say they ever really get \u201ccomfortable\u201d to use. They\u2019re also costly. This thing has paid for itself already. I\u2019ve used it on everything from my face to my bikini area and it\u2019s so good. The first few times it\u2019s painful but it\u2019s not unbearable. It does ease with time which is nice. I always apply Finipil after and haven\u2019t experienced any irritation or ingrowns yet. The only downside is that it isn\u2019t cordless but it\u2019s really a non-issue considering my proximity to plugs when I use it.", "Only dislike is that I have to plug it in to use and the chord isn't exactly that long. However, I hated shaving almost everyday and stayed getting skin irritations from it. Now I'm hairless and don't shave!! The hair seems to grow back thinner than before and I can barely tell if there's hair growing. That's when the light comes in handy in finding any missed hairs! Wish I found this year's ago, but I'm happy to say I have it now!", "I bought this product for my face, I suffer from PCOS & my facial hair has been out of control. I hate shaving due to the shadow i get afterwards, & I cant wax. This product works well, but MAKE SURE YOU EXFOLIATE BEFORE USING IT, & IT DOES HURT when using it on the chin, cheeks, & neck! It works really good, but I suggest buying a numbing cream if you can handle pain. 9/10 would recommend:)", "Okay I bought this not expecting much. I ah e been using it for the past five days and I\u2019m already loving it. I have waxed my legs before, Brazilian, armpits etc. I bought it to start training my leg hairs to grow slower so that I do not have to shave as much. It is not that painful, you get used to it very quickly. I have not only done my legs but my armpits and part of my face. I know it says not to, but I\u2019ve tried it and. I problem. It has been so smooth. I even tried my bikini line. I am really loving this product. I highly recommend. The roller applicator sometimes falls off but not a big deal.", "I am so happy I got this. Is it super painful? Yes. But what can you expect? It absolutely already was less painful when I went back the second time. It also depends on the area. My arms were awful, and the area by my ankles hurt a lot too. My thighs were no big deal. Surprisingly, my bikini like wasn\u2019t too bad, until I moved toward the back. I\u2019m partly afraid it was pinching my skin, but I don\u2019t see how it would.\n\nIt takes a long time, but I\u2019ll just go over my legs and arms every once in a while, letting it be okay that my legs aren\u2019t completely smooth. I worry I\u2019m just breaking the hairs, but I think at least most of them are being pulled from the root. Idk that that\u2019s a product issue.\n\nThe light is honestly crucial for me. When it\u2019s dark out and there\u2019s no natural light, this makes it 100x easier to use.\n\nIt\u2019s loud, I just wear earbuds at watch videos because I don\u2019t like loud noises and as mentioned it takes a while.\n\nI love even the little trimmer attachment.\n\nI would recommend so far. I\u2019ll change my review if anything changes.", "These reviews aren't kidding when they say this little baby hurts like a mother! I bought this because I have PCOS with coarse facial hair, and lots of it. I tried this little jerk under my chin and could feel it ripping the hair out. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish the area because 1) I wasn't prepared for that kind of pain. And 2) my in-laws showed up and there was no time to finish. Definitely not a rush job.\nI hope I can conjure the strength of Zeus to actually finish the job, but I'm going to give this rotten beast two thumbs up.", "I love this tool!! I\u2019m brand new to epilating, but not hair removal from the root.\nMy main method of hair removal for most of my life has been waxing. I\u2019m a hairy woman with course, thick hair. I dislike the 5 o\u2019clock shadow of shaving, so I\u2019ve only used it periodically and in case of emergencies. I\u2019ve also used threading (the most painful method), at home laser, and shaving in emergencies (but my least favorite hair removal method).\n\nI\u2019m brand new to epilating but thankfully have thinned out my hair from consistent waxing. I will compare the pros and cons of epilating to waxing. Keep in mind, today is my second day of using the machine.\n\n-yesterday I used the machine for my chin hairs and sideburns. It was sensitive, not painful. About equal discomfort as waxing, less than individual testing (because of the built-in massage?). I was nervous because of the negative reviews, so I went slow. It went well, no skin irritation.\n\nSince yesterday went well, I fired up the epilator at the high speed this evening and went nuts! Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve gathered this far:\n\nPros:\n\n1. Time saver\nToday, I completed both of my legs (thigh and calf), my forearms, my cheeks, and upper lip\u2026 ALL in about an hour!!! This is significantly less time than waxing (which I\u2019ve been practicing for the last 15 years)! Remember you save time in the prepping & cleaning up after waxing either (I.e. warm the wax, wait for the right temp, showering & cleaning the residue of the body and workspace).\n\n2. Mess-free! I did this while watching TV on the couch. Sure, there\u2019s probably a bunch of hair in my living room, but it\u2019s probably minimal compared to how much my two dogs shed. It\u2019s also better on my hardwood floors than it is In the shower Drain (as with shaving). 10x better than the wax residue all over the place!\n\n3. Cheap!!. I spent 1.5 times as much I\u2019d spend on a bag of wax. During the summer months, I typically go through a bag in a couple of months . If this machine lasts me 3 months I\u2019d get my moneys worth (not insulting the cost of the wax warmer, sticks, etc.)\n\n4. Works on shorter hair (1/8\u201d) than waxing (1/4\u201d), so it\u2019s better for exposed areas.\nCon:\n-this model us not battery operated! I was under that impression, but that part just looks like false advertising\n\nHonestly, I really like this method a lot so I will probably get a battery operated version so I can use this while sitting in the the car!\n\nHopefully I don\u2019t get toO many ingrown hairs. I prepped my skin by exfoliating in the shower before starting my legs. I can update my review after several treatments.\n\nOverall a very positive experience and you can\u2019t go wrong for $35! I was ready to drop the thousands of dollars for professional laser\u2026. I\u2019m making this my new go to method!", "I tried the REM spring before and people claimed it to be so much better however, in my experience this product blew the spring out of the water. It took less than 30 seconds to have all those annoying hairs on my chin and neck removed. I highly recommend", "I liked the product overall although I felt that it was too high in price point if you get yourself a epilator from anywhere else at a lower price it does the exact same thing if you have thick hair it\u2019s not going to work as well for example I\u2019m Mexican and it sucks on my leg hair but the rest of my body it does great", "I was very tired waxing my legs and I was even considering to start shave them. But I wanted to try other things before that so I found this cute tool. Is very easy to use but also safe and is huge the difference of pain using it than waxing. I\u2019m very happy I bought it. The light is very useful specially because my eyes needs extra help , I wear lenses so , extra light is always better.\nI really recommend to get one of this.", "This device is great. I cannot use at home IPL due to my darker skin so I bought this as an alternative. Yes, it hurts a lot the first time you do it. But the next session it\u2019s a breeze. Cuts down shaving time and gives a more smooth appearance to my skin. Definitely recommend.", "I was scared to use this after reading the reviews. I don\u2019t have the highest pain tolerance. I showered and exfoliated before using it. I started with my legs. Other than a little sting here and there it wasn\u2019t painful for me at all on my legs and arms. I thought maybe I was doing it wrong but no, I have no hair on either. Each time I\u2019ve used it I can definitely see where the hairs were removed so it\u2019s doing what it is supposed to do. Then I thought I\u2019d be brave and try my upper lip. That was a no. That definitely hurt. I\u2019m kinda wanting to try the bikini area but after the upper lip I haven\u2019t gotten that brace yet. \ud83d\ude01 if I do I will definitely trim before I do it.\n\nAll in all this was a great purchase for me. I\u2019m happy not to shave my legs every other day.", "I thought I knew everything there was to know about body hair removal. Glad to be proven wrong! I honestly have no problem with body hair. If I could, I would grow all mine out. Unfortunately, because my hair is so thick, it's a lot more uncomfortable for me.\n\nMy pits were always itching like crazy, no matter how close to the skin the hairs were shaved. I was told that my pits wouldn't itch as much if I grew out the hairs, but it took me several months to do and it was still itchy as ever, so I always went back to shaving them. I had tried home waxing, but it hurt and was so expensive to have the warmer, the wax, the stick and strips, and the pre and post-wax skin products. I also went through razors like crazy, because my hair is so thick, they'd dull pretty quickly and create these little red bumps or would knick me and I hated having the equivalent of a paper cut, but worse, in the middle of my armpit. I considered laser hair removal, but if a wax kit is too expensive, I'd never be able to afford multiple sessions of the treatment.\n\nI discovered epilating through a video I saw online and it intrigued me. Tweezing all the hairs would work a lot like waxing in that it would pluck all the hairs without leaving stubble, and the baldness would last a while. The difference with tweezing the individual hairs is that, unlike with waxing or shaving, you aren't hurting or damaging the skin by ripping it off or cutting it. Sounded AWESOME!\n\nWhen it finally came and I turned it on, I admit it was a bit terrifying. This device is loud. Not a dealbreaker for me, but might be for others. I tried it out on my legs first. I was told that epilating would be the worst pain ever felt for the first couple of sessions, and I wanted to see if that was true. Honestly, my legs were fine and I wasn't in any pain. I ended up doing the whole thing because it actually felt kind of nice. I was feeling pretty confident about it and decided that my armpits wouldn't be so bad. Oh boy, did I regret thinking that. It really REALLY hurt! I kept up with it though. I wanted to make sure my pits were purified from the itchy fiends! Finally, it was done. And NO ITCHINESS!!!!! For several days! And luckily, when the hairs started to grow back, they didn't come back all at once, just a few at a time, so maintaining it did actually hurt a LOT less, took less time, and kept my pits feeling spectacular! They also look very nice. No red razor bumps or knicks and no stubble.\n\nThe great thing about this device is that it also comes with a regular shaving attachment, which I did use to get rid of the tiny, thin, silkier hairs that the tweezers seem to miss, however, I don't reach for it super often because those hairs don't really bother me, but it's still nice to have the option. It is also corded, which means that it won't slow down needing to be recharged or anything, and the cord can also be removed from the device for easy storage. There are a few downsides though. Firstly, the noise, which I don't really mind, but it did scare my cat a little. Secondly, that I have to go over the area a couple times in order to get every hair. It has two different speeds, but I'm thinking it actually needs more little tweezers so it would only need one go. And lastly, it's somewhat difficult to clean. The cleaning brush that it comes with isn't very remarkable, but the tweezing device itself - many of the tinier hairs get caught around the little tweezers, which are difficult to clean out because the space surrounding them is so tiny. Still, I don't think this epilator is terrible. I really like it a lot.\n\nOverall, for my first epilator, it's pretty great and it does get all the hairs I want out, even if it takes a bit of effort. I haven't used a razor since getting it and I'm honestly thinking of giving my unused razors to someone who wants them.", "So I was scared to death to use this. And I must admit, doing the upper lip, made me feel like I was being electrocuted! BUT, once I saw how great of a job it did on my super sensitive skin, I was hooked! Did my arm pits, arms, my knuckles that I didn\u2019t know had such long hair on them. \ud83e\udd74 Can\u2019t wait for my leg hair to grow in. Works great and you can see the roots on the hairs it rips out. Bye bye razors and razor burn!!! Oh, and I\u2019m a total wuss so if I can use this, you can too.", "I am a large, hairy, biological, male but I wear clothes typically made for women about 50% of the time. Over the years, I've done everything from waxing to depilatory cream to razors to whatever I could find to remove large amounts of hair pretty quickly and without too many side effects. I just used this one for the first time and my jaw is on the floor. I can't believe I'm just learning about it. I have super sensitive skin and the depilatory creams and shaving leave me a huge, red, mess for days, assuming it ever goes away. This machine literally yanks the hairs out to perfectly smooth, with a small amount of redness that goes away after a few minutes. The ladies are correct. It definitely hurts, but it's so effective that you're too distracted by smoothness to worry about it. Very impressive machine. I'm hooked.", "I never write reviews but I have to say, I\u2019m absolutely in love with this device.\nI get waxed but with work schedules it\u2019s hard to keep up with so this is great for in between. That way I\u2019m not shaving and my esthetician doesn\u2019t get mad at me.\nI\u2019m pretty fair skinned, and my hair is dark and coarse. It DOES hurt. I have to take breaks in between but it hurts about the same amount when I get waxed.\nIf you have a low pain tolerance, I would not suggest this to use.\n\nIt broke a couple of my hairs instead of pulling them out completely but I just grabbed those with tweezers no problem.\nI think the only reason it\u2019s taking me long to do my legs is because it hurts in those tender spots, but other than that it\u2019s honestly a great product.\nWill definitely buy another one for backup in case (:\n\nAlso, it\u2019s not cordless, it does have to stay plugged in but the cord is pretty long, I just sit on my bed after a shower and it reaches no problem (:", "This is the first epilator I\u2019ve ever used and I am never going back to shaving! It does hurt a bit at first but it\u2019s not unbearable. I have been able to successfully complete my legs, underarms, and bikini area for several months now with no issues other than the device sometimes gets a bit warm if I do all of it at once. I highly recommend giving this epilator a try if you are new to epilating and just want to try it out. I might consider upgrading devices in the future but this one serves as a good cheaper starting point if you are unsure about epilating.", "I have used epilators for over 20 years now and i bought this one as i wanted a cheap replacement as my UK machine was not working in the US... this is my 3rd or 4th braun and i was aprehensive as i had this model 10 years ago... but what a pleasant surprise, still as good as my old model, actually better than much more expensive ones... only needs a couple of passes and does not leave a hair... would recommend it to everyone, why to spend more money if you can buy this one???", "Man it freaking hurts but boy does it work! It takes forever but I don\u2019t think my legs have ever been so smooth before, however I\u2019m to nervous to use it on any other body parts other than my legs. I have only used it below my knees for that is the only place I can bear the pain. I have also never waxed or anything other than shave before hand so it might be harder on my skin or hair as opposed to someone who might have waxed before using this product."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06WGVVSBC", "title": "Serta Sierra Living Room Sofas Modern Design Microfiber Upholstered Couch Ideal for Smaller Spaces, Arm Chair, Smoke Gray", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81wofBpJYBL._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "29 ratings", "description": "Bring comfort and midcentury modern style to your apartment condo or dorm with the Serta Sierra Collection Living Room Sofa.

Half the holes did not line up correctly and due to that the pieces that slide in together wobble. No matter how much you tighten them it does not matter. To me, I would expect this for some bargain bin $200 couch maybe. Not one with a decent brand name and one that is sold on multiple well-respected sites.

I would recommend this chair for carpeted rooms or at least areas with a rug. This chair is so lightweight, if you lean heavily to either side, it feels like the chair would tip over. I don't like the velcro on the back of the cushions keeping them in place because it's a hair magnet living with animals. Even though you don't see it most of the time, the times you do uncover the velcro part, it gets really unsightly and is difficult to pick the hair out of. The bottom seat is soft but sinks, so if you're looking for a firm seat, look elsewhere. Assembly was difficult, with putting the legs on the bottom piece being the hardest part. There isn't much room to maneuver the small wrench you have to turn to get the screws to dig in.

I was intrigued by the YouTube videos and friends who said they switched to menstrual cups and natural pads because they didn't want to waste money and or get sick from all the random chemicals in feminine products. I was a little hesitant but I asked my gynecologist what she thought since I do have fibroids and bleed like I've been stabbed a million times. Anyway I was shocked at how easy it was to insert this, I did try with some water based lube but that got gross so I checked out some other ladies hacks for using these and tried putting it in during a shower and that 1) was less gross/messy feeling-again I bleed super heavy the first few days, 2) was way more comfortable and easy to put in than trying to do it on the toilet or just weird squatting technique, and finally it made it really get the right suction seal. The first time I tried it with lube on the toilet there was some leakage that the pads got. I was worried it would get super stuck or lost like some of the scary videos mentioned but it actually wasn't hard to insert or remove, I left the tail thing on and it was easy to grip that because of the ridges and same for the bottom of the cup I was able to break the seal easily with the little ridges on it. I actually went to the gym and couldn't feel it and like videos and even the instructions say you can use tube bathroom with it in since its not in the urethra, luckily I didn't have problems with it putting pressure on my bladder. I found the small to be more comfortable and better fit for me but was glad there are two to try since this was my first time using menstrual cups I had no reference point besides pads and tampons. I know some women chop the tail off but I'm fine with it on and honestly didn't feel it. Even with a heavy flow I didn't have any accidents like I typically do with super tampons and pads.\n\nThe natural pads are super soft and comfy. Honestly I was surprised it doesn't smell like disposable ones do and when I tried them solo without the cup I did have leakage. The little buttons, which I'm not sure if I'm using it correctly by clipping them together or not on my underwear doesn't really keep them in place. I think these will be better as back up for if there's menstrual cup mishaps and light days. I will say though I was really happy with these not staining like I thought they would and being surprisingly comfy, soft, and breathable. The bag was super cute and definitely made this period less ugh.\n\nOverall very happy with the switch, it's safer- not a chance of TSS, super cute carrying cases that aren't super obvious that it's period related- my husband had no clue until I told him, in the long run more economic and better for the environment and if my gyno is correct will help reduce that barbwire, shabby, super bloody grossness I've endured since my first period over 25yrs ago. I'm totally recommending this to my sisters and nieces.", "I can't believe I waited this long to try this. I remember 5 years ago someone mentioning them and I totally forgot. Then I randomly googled one day and found them on Amazon and gave it a try. It is super awkward the first few times inserting and removing, but I cannot even begin to express how wonderful it is to not have all of the regular mess that you ladies know about with tampons. I have had zero leakage and zero oops so far. Like I said, it is definitely awkward to figure out how to properly insert and take out, but you figure out what works after a few times. It is hands down better than tampons and I will never go back if I have a choice. Even the smell is better, and no mess in the trashcan from the tampons to deal with either....TMI but I had to share. I have only taken it out in the shower, so I can't comment on what it would be like if you had to do it in the bathroom. If you're on the fence - I would urge you to jump and never look back.", "This starter set is fantastic. I have never used a menstrual cup or reusable pads before. Because of some health problems, I am trying to live a more natural life and decided to try this route. I was really apprehensive about inserting the cup. But the first time I did it, it only took 20 seconds! It stayed in perfectly and has worked perfectly every time. No leaks or discomfort. I'm amazed how simple and effective it is. I wear it during my active day and all night in bed. I have used both sizes of cups and found that the smaller one is better for me. I am 37 and have never had children. That being said, the larger cup was just as easy to insert, I just noticed it seems a little long for me. The reusable pads are great! They are very soft and comfortable, super absorbent, and well made. Much less changing necessary compared to disposable pads. The only issues that it slides around a little because there is no adhesive backing. But that con is worth all the pros.\n\nI am so glad I bought this set and will never go back to disposable pads and tampons again. I feel really good about myself, the way I'm treating my body, and the money I'm saving. Never been this excited about a period \u263a", "These pads are great! I have very sensitive skin and the normal disposable pads were really causing me issues so I decided to change to the Luna reusable pads. Very happy I did so! My sensitive skin is happy, my wallet is happy and I love being able to be more environmental as well! Few things I would improve: 1) The pad tends to move/slide a bit which is frustrating since I'd like them to be more front section when in use hence I keep on pulling the pad back in position. Maybe for a improved design, the pads could have some kind of snap on in the front section of the pad that could hold the pad better in place? 2) The picture design is a bit childish. Maybe something more adult like (for example flowers etc) would be more in place. I don't need my period pads to look like child diapers...\n\nBut definitely still a 5 start product! I'm going to recommend these to all my women friends! Wish I realized to buy these earlier!! Fantastic product!!!", "I've been using a popular brand of disposable pads for many years but great tired of having to change them often thru out the day during my period if it was moderate-heavy. I learned about reusable pads and did research on them and liked that they were good for the environment and were very absorbent. When I wore them for the 1st time it was kinda weird but the pad felt comfortable and I wore it a whole day without having to change it til I got home.I soaked in cold water handwashed in sink before putting in washing machine. I was impressed and am still amazed at how absorbent they are and will buy more in other colors!", "First time I use menstrual cups and reusable pads. Size B cup was a bit long for me but even then it was really comfortable, I could hardly feel it I think because the silicone is so soft (softer than sckoon) and I had no leaks. I did a lot of research before buying so getting the seal right wasn't too hard. I liked the pads but the flaps I think are a bit short and when buttoned, make the pad bunch and it's already kind of thick. You could definitely see it through my clothes, so I didn't wear them out of the house. The straps on little bag for the cups (not the wet bag) came apart first time I pulled on it. I haven't used the wet bag yet because I didn't use the pads outside of home.", "So I\u2019ve been using a menstrual cup for over a year now but hadn\u2019t tried reusable pads until I made this purchase back about six months ago. Let me tell you- it\u2019s changed my cycle for he better. I often have really heavy flows with back cramps and though the cup gets rid of cramps for some people they don\u2019t for me. So on my bad days I prefer the pads and on muni light days I use the cups. The reusable pads are incredible. They\u2019re insanely absorbent- I\u2019ve never had a leak in them. They\u2019re comfortable too Church I was worried about because yes, they do look bulky. Also! No wrapper noise when you\u2019re in a public restroom!! And they\u2019re cute all wrapped up and in your purse, they don\u2019t just look like a piece of plastic trash in your purse pockets. Love love love them. Couldn\u2019t say enough good things about this package. I love the cup on light days and the pads on heavy days. Perfect little kit.", "I had been researching menstrual cups for about a year. I was really on the fence due to the fact that I have a Paraguard IUD and there is a slight chance that it could move the IUD or cause issues of it coming out. I just decided to give it a try, using extra precautions. (I read a lot of blogs/message boards on the subject) I COULDN'T be happier! This is a game changer. You have to be comfortable with your body, and the learning curve of how it should fit, etc but once you figure it out OMG I have to say it's just great. Anything that makes me say great referring to my period is a winner. This Luna brand seemed to be perfect for me. I haven't tried any others but I don't think I will unless I run into issues which I think are slim. I love all the little accessories it comes with even though I haven't needed anything except the satin keeper bag.", "Loved loved loved! Wish o had known about this sooner. Takes a little to figure out the luna cup... I've had 5 kids and the small cup was fine. The reusable pads where have they been all my life... the softest material to touch and works way better than the \"trash pads\". I actually felt cleaner and less worried. Plus no embarrassing purchases at the store with men cashiers... ug the worst! All I gotta do is get my daughter started on the pads and when she's a lot older I'll explain the luna cup! No t's for her because I've had toxic shock... not fun... if you ever get nauseous while wearing one and its outta the blue... it's your body giving you signs. Stay away from the T's. Oh and all the gals in my family call pads. ..\"biscuits\" lolol... easier to ask for that and be inconspicuous!", "So far I havn't used this product but it came in the packages and was all wrapped nice I like the soft feel to the cups and im hoping it'll feel very natural when in use, it does not have any bad smell to it. Little pouche fit them both perfectly so they fit in my purse for when I do need it. The pads all came individually wrapped which I like a lot they fit perfectly folded up into little wet bag from my understanding I could throw them in with my laundry to wash them I like that they're black because then I don't feel like I have stained them when I do have my period. It also came with 3 different card for me to understabd how to use are care for that was a very nice suprise! I'll update again with first use.", "First time using a cup. I've had two kids but I have light to medium flow days. I used the smaller cup for all three days (i have a short period). Very easy to insert. I used the c fold and wet the cup with water before insertion the first time. I happened to be lucky that I got it right the first time. I can't feel it and only leaked (as usual even with a tampon) on my heaviest day overnight. Very easy to clean in between rinsed and a little water/vinegar soak helps with smell before storage.\n\nThe reusable pads are the best. They are longer and a little thicker than a 7pk of another brand I had ordered but they are not bulky. I use True Laundry Detergent to spot clean and hang to dry until laundry day. I don't have an issue with stains. Do NOT use fabric softener.", "The cups are easy enough to use and similar to a Diva cup. They have a cute little storage pouch that is nice for carrying or storing. The pads themselves are fine if the user is relatively sedentary - although they cup back around to clip underneath a pair of undies (ostensibly creating the wings that some women hate), there is nothing that keeps them from moving. During Zumba or running, I experienced them shifting towards the back of my undies, which could be problematic. They have full coverage when positioned correctly, though. Definitely worth the money.", "I love this product easy to clean, no odor did not have to change a lot. The underwear are snug that come with the set if your a little thicker in the thighs you may need a larger pair. I had no leaks almost 1 but I do believe because the undergarment I wore wasn't as snug fitting. I always try to wear the underwear that come with the set because I feel more comfortable at bedtime NOT a leak insight the next morning, I wish I would've bought them sooner! Sooo discreet open your purse and no one knows what that your even carrying a pad. Would recommend to anyone thinking about buying I order 2 sets from my husbands account and I'm thinking about ordering more as gifts for my nieces.", "I just got my little kit and so far I like it. I have menstrual cups before. I have Skoon, diva, and lena cups.I would say this cup is firmer then the diva cup but not by much. My skoon cup is the firmest cup I have with the lena close behind it. I need cups that are on the firmer side and I have a very heavy flow so its nice this kit comes with both sizes. The pads are my first cloth pads but so far I love them. I plan on getting more. The bag for the cups was much larger then my other cup bags but its big enough to carry both cups in one so you can switch to either one during your flow. (my period fluctuates constantly)", "(Tim's wife here... in case anyone is concerned a guy is writing a review on period wear) These pads exceeded my expectations. I had no issues with leakage and unlike some other reviewers, I did not experience any sliding with the pads. I even wore them through a 12 hour nursing shift without incident (lots of walking, bending, and twisting) You can definitely feel they are there, but instead of being bothersome, I found it comforting. They held up to my regular flow without any problems. They washed well. I'm not really sure what to do with the underwear. They seemed really tight. The pads alone are worth 5 stars, and I don't want to drop my rating just because I don't know how to use a product.", "After realizing the amount of trash us women produce using pads & tampons I decided to transition over to a more cost effective and environmentally healthy product (aka as the Luna Cup). I can\u2019t say the first attempt was a success because it is a different product that what I\u2019m used to using. But after watching a few instructional videos and not giving up, this has become a life long gift! Honestly, my flow has become lighter, my cramps are more bearable and it gives me the ability to be more active without any worry of having a bathroom nearby. I hope women around the world change their use of menstrual products to these type of reusable products.", "I love these pads! They are so soft. Not only am I trying to save money and be more environmentally friendly, but traditional pads gave me heat rashes which I don\u2019t have to worry about with my new reusable pads. The only problem is they slide around sometimes because they don\u2019t stick to your undies, but I think that is an issue with all reusable pads. It\u2019s still totally worth the purchase! I just wear the cup when I go out and the pad when I\u2019m at home.", "Surprisingly cute for its function. I thought it would slide around without the adhesive but it stayed put. Two minor complaints why I didn't give five stars, 1: tried to hand wash (which worked okay) took forever to dry (I know, what do I expect with something absorbent) 2: I will get used to it I know but I've been spoiled by the wick away moisture-ness of disposable pads felt the moisture with these. Once I see how much money I'm saving totally worth it!", "I haven't been able to use these since my purchase but they're very cute and I love that it came with a cute pouch and wet bag which makes it convenient when on the go. My only concern is that I bought them to be more eco-friendly but everything was wrapped in plastic - which kinda defeated the point. Other than that, I'm sure that I'll enjoy them once it's that time!", "This is the first time I chose to use a product like this. I can say that it is easy to learn how to use. Took me a couple of times, but that goes for anything trying it for the first time. The cup is soft and flexible and perfect for my needs. I can say the pads are a bit bulky, but they are very absorbent. I look forward to saving money in the future.

Just make sure to buy balancing beads", "Okay so let me start out pointing out why this review needs to be taken with a grain of salt. I'm driving a 2015 Toyota Tacoma DCSB with a Manual Transmission. So any wet traction issues I'm having may or may NOT apply to you. I have only the spare tire, the Tailgate, and about 25ft of medium duty chain (average tow chain thickness) in the bed of the truck. I have skidplates, a front plate bumper, and rock sliders on my truck. Rear bumper is the stock tin one that for whatever reason they thought chrome was a good choice. So I notice these tires break loose much much easier than my old Mickey Thompson MTZs did. These tires are more on the line of Goodyears Duratraks after they've been ran for a year (Those were my tire BEFORE the Mickey Thompson's). I CAN bring the truck sideways with these things with no effort in the rain, and moderate effort dry. During the rain the TC comes on quite often on city streets. Dry weather these do amazing, they have been worn down quite a bit but stuck to the road like a sports car. Splashed through a puddle and they slid out but once they dried they were glued I could take turns and not even hear them whine about the g's. They have impressed me enough to bump up the rating to 4* but I wouldn't buy them again still I'm going back to my mickey's. I have taken them offroad and they performed better than I expected after how they did on the streets. I was able to crawl through 3 ft deep carved out mud holes and keep chugging along (provided I didn't get high centered like in the last hole, for those out of the loop high centered is your on your frame so your tires aren't doing you much good. My skidplate became more of a plow than a skid) I don't have more than 8k miles on the tires so wear is okay. I am noticing some chop but thats alignment issue not the tire itself. My neighbor has a Toyota 4Runner with this same tire. He has had the TCS come on quite a few times in wet conditions as well so be ware if you need to make a left at a light in the rain. Finally got some snow to test these in. They did GREAT. Went through about 5\" of snow with no issue what so ever. Still able to have fun in a very controlled way. With the Mickey Thompsons the same price \u00b1$5 I'd say save yourself the cons of these tires and get the mickey thompson Baja MTZs.\n\nPerformance:\nDRY - 7 out of 10\nWET - 3 out of 10\nSNOW - 6 out of 10\nMUD - 8 out of 10", "So I ended up with a skinny pair of these 215 85r16. They came with this weird manual transmission swapped Caprice Station Wagon that I bought. The guy who built the car would use it to tow a dump trailer full of hay in his field. Car has an elocker whole 9. I bought it to tow but didn't really plan to take it offroad. So I had a nice pair of mud tires. I also have a 2000 Nissan Frontier 4x4 that was on bald Bridgestones, I decided to mount them on some Xterra wheels and bought a second pair for my Frontier. They look good. a little small, plenty of clearance, but I dig em. They ride good, grip good, what else can you ask for? I think these work out to a 30.4\" or so. They rose the truck up a good bit. Will have to get this thing offroad asap", "Nice aggressive tread pattern. Works well on road or off. Very low road noise. Very satisfied so far!!!!!!", "Great smooth riding and sounding tires.

Tried them out with NO balancing on them just out of curiosity, and they where pretty smooth. Offroad traction on trails has been great and these have taken the mildly modded Samurai to yet another level of improved capability. Previous tires were 10+ year old BFG AT with only 30% or so tread left and to be fair, I got them 2nd hand and didn't get to experience them new. So, probably any half way decent tire would have been noticeably better than old dried out tires, not matter how good they may have been when new. That being said, the Samurai nearly doubled it's abilities with it's 3\" lift and move up to 31's... then adding a rear locker and proper diff gearing netted almost as big a gain again. Finally, adding these tires was not quite as big a jump as the other mods... but, again, a VERY noticeable gain in offroad traction and climbing ability. Long, 100% grade climbs that used to take effort and both hands and were a bit of a challenge, suddenly became casual, one hand on the wheel affairs. No chance to try them in in rain or snow yet.... but trail and rocky stuff has been great. Watch the \"cooper puncture test\" video online. As for noise.... my 4x4 is NOT my daily driver... so \"tire noise\" is more like TIRE MUSIC to me. But they are not particularly loud. Yes, you can hear them and they are more noise than your street car.... but, by FAR are NOT that noisy for mud tires. Prices on these fluctuate FAR more than BFG KM2 (my other choice).... but the BFG's would NEVER drop as low priced as these have from time to time.... When they dropped to only about $25 more than the cheapest tires out there, it was a no brainer! VERY pleased with them! [O.|||||.O]", "Very reasonable price, great tire to run on the 20 inch wheels.

Just giving anyone who plans on using them on their car as a daily a heads up because that\u2019s what I do and it does get annoying after awhile. I also drive a two door JK so it\u2019s definitely more bouncy in general too. But still a great tire. Just a little pricey though.", "I purchased 4 of these off off Amazon for my 2018 Jeep Wrangler JL 4-door.

The hum is certainly tolerable and as good as could be expected.\nMy biggest surprise is the wet road braking response of these tires. It is excellent. I have had some in the past that were like a sled on a down hill snow slope when it came to wet weather braking.\n\nUPDATE: 14 Feb 2022 -- 4 years and 45,000 total miles.

Ive been playing around with tire pressure to get even wear because I want them to last as long as possible. Max rating is 35, but to get more even wear, I'm sitting at 28-30 PSI. A few things I've noticed that some people might be interested in before buying, the tread is softer than I expected but I have a lighter vehicle so I hope they still last, they make a little bit of noise on the road but its not bad at all, they're definitely not your average all-terrain tire, the spacing between the tread is closer to a mud terrain but the center tread pattern looks a little more normal, handling for pavement isn't as good as my old BFGs but thats not what I got them for, and I've already had plenty of compliments.\n\nI haven't done any serious off-roading with them yet, but I do plan to, and then I will update this review. I have driven them a little in the sand and on a few dirt roads, they seem to be extremely grippy.\n\nUpdate: The wheels that I put them on were 15x8, which caused the tires to bulge a little and could lead to pre-mature wear in the center of the tread. Luckily I spotted this early, ordered some 15x10s and threw those on (8.5-11 recommended). The tires look much better on those and are now touching evenly across the tread. I'm also able to air them appropriately to around 34 PSI. I did take them out on the trail also, and they are awesome! The trails were a mix of sand and mud, and these things were un-stoppable. I purposefully stopped half way up a sand dune to see if I'd get stuck, and they just pulled me right up no problem.", "I've put these tires through a lot and broken my truck more than one time with these on. I've owned them a hair less than a year but I already know I'll be buying another set of these when the time comes. I've always been a huge fan of Cooper tires and seen their compounds last years without dry-rotting in the Arizona sun.\n\nThese tires dig deep and they really aren't too loud on the highway. I live in an area that gets a decent amount of snow and ice. These tires are unbelievable in fresh snow but these are not ice tires. They do great for a mud-terrain but I wouldn't be trusting them to stop you on a dime if you are skating on a big sheet of ice. Look at an all-terrain if you are wanting something that can do better on ice. The trade-off is bad mud performance for better ice performance. What's more important to you?\n\nI can see just a little wear on the sharp edges on the lugs of the tires but the wear after about 5000 miles is flat and even (despite the wildly messed up alignment on my truck). I would recommend these tires to anyone doing medium-heavy duty off-road. I never recommend these types of tires for a pavement princess but they do look pretty great on any ride.", "", "Look great with solid white lettering\nHave been holding up well good snow traction\nJust remember that mud tire do need a bit shorter tire rotation interval", "Background: On my daily driver wrangler that mostly goes over NYC potholes\n\nI have only had these tires for a few months but so far they are awesome.

At one point, I had a rock poking my tire with no issues, even waited there as my brother took a picture lol. Went on some green,blues, blacks, went through streams and mud with no problems. I probably could have done even tougher trails but I didn\u2019t want to break anything. At the end of the day, I aired back up and was on my way. Again, I one hundred percent recommend. Looking forward to see how they are in the snow but I am sure they are great.", "These are a replacement for a set of STT's on a 2012 Jeep Wrangler JKU. All 5 were rotated in and the STT's still had tread left after over 60,000 miles. These do well on and off road so far. The pro does seem better on wet roads. Great looks and not too noisy at all.", "Great product!", "I came from BFG KM2 Mud Terrains. These tires are pretty comparable in most terrain, but exceeded my expectations in snow. I have a friend who has had them for about 4 years, with no issues. I drive this Jeep once every week or so, and I think the tires develop flat spots when sitting too long, but they go away pretty quickly.

Other razors have left me and my bathroom looking like a b movie murder scene.", "My daughter has been using these razor blades for a couple of years, but I only recently tried them. My first razor was an old fashioned double blade one handed down from my dad, to my mom, to me. With used blades, they were too afraid I'd cut myself. Yeah. Right. I was a never ending series of nicks and cuts. It wasn't a very good look for a teen girl. I thought I was progressive-and I guess I was at the time-when I upgraded to disposable razors. I used them for decades, and felt very sophisticated when I moved on to the disposables with the little moisturizing strip, and even more so when double and triple blades came out. And I got into a rut, thinking those were good enough for me. After all, it was only my legs, right? Well, fast forward to being the mom of a teenage girl and being unable to resist buying her the cute pink razor with 5 blades and moisturizing pads, regardless of price. But I started sneaking use of her razor a few months back and now I'm addicted. I've never had a closer shave, and my legs feel all smooth and soft when I'm done. I don't have to soap up first, and I never feel the tug I did when I was using the disposables. And I can go an extra day before I have to shave again. I can't imaging how the manufacturer will improve on this design, but I look forward to finding out.\n\nUSER TIP: Place the razor with the moisturizing pads UP when not using it. If you leave them down, they may stick to the surface they're resting on and pull off prematurely.", "Not sure how much time 1 cassette can be used, but those sponges on top and bottom fall after a while, and I do my pubic area only, but it is cheaper than same product in my area, Europe", "I used these whenever I didn't want the hassle of using shaving cream, and also when I travel (so I don't need to pack/purchase shaving cream.) They can be a bit pricey and I only use them during the summer months when I'm shaving a lot. But they are so convenient and work great. It's a little tougher to get into the tight bikini areas because these are a little bulkier than a typical razor. But if you need a quick shave under your arms or down your legs, these work in seconds. And again, they are super handy to have with you while traveling. Plus, no shaving cream mess!

It\u2019s such a great razor , easy to use! You wont even feel like you\u2019re shaving and it leaves the skin so smooth!!!", "When using these for the first time, I had to check multiple times to ensure it was actually working. The glide was so smooth and had none of the normal scraping against the skin I was used to. Bare in mind, I typically shave dry as I have littles and a demanding job. I do not enjoy shaving my legs so I want to get it over with as quickly as possible to move on to more exciting things to me. The built in Olay shave gel bars gave my skin a light lather so the blades glided with ease. Afterwards, my legs were soft as though they already had lotion. Convienently, Gillette Venus also worked under the arms and in the nether regions.\n\n5 uses later and I still get the silky smooth glide and softness of skin. The blades also still have a good amount of gel bars left too!\n\nAwesome product that I was lucky enough to try for free (#gotitfree). Was I not as lucky, I am not sure I would have tried it. However, I can say I am adding it to the shopping list now!", "I ordered 5 razors and I only got four 28.00 of missing product is a lot!", "Haha honestly it\u2019s kind of funny and very strange. The package I received was not only not the right scent but the packaging looked like it came from the very back of someone\u2019s bathroom drawer. Mind you the packing was something I had never seen. Needless to say I became curious what this was. I searched the product code on a cosmetic calculator to find out the manufacture date \u2026.6/22/15 yes that\u2019s 2015! 7 years ago - Lol I thought I was reading it wrong on the package. Also it was manufactured in Germany , not Boston ma like most Venus razors in the us. Needless to say I\u2019m not sure how this happened but I\u2019ll be returning them and just going to target. I did not even attempt to use these decaying razors.", "First time using these, and I didn't care about the \"sugar berry\". However for whatever reason, the blades are lasting longer than usual and still provide a smooth shave.", "Venus razors are perfect for those spots that aren't so easy to get. They leave your skin exceedingly soft and smooth . Also the bar almost creates a barrier so that nicking or cutting yourself seems much harder to do than more traditional blades. I love the Venus razors. The packaging is easy the get into and easy to change out razor blades. The razor holder is not so handy but that's not what I buy it for so it wouldn't detour me from re purchasing this product. This scent seems to be a few dollars more than other scents and not particularly smelly so I probably would choose one of the other scents for the cheapier price, there was nothing special about this scent to warrant the extra $3. All in all this is a great product and I would highly recommend them.", "Pretty good. I liked using them on my legs, but due to the large moisturizing pads, it is hard to shave small tight areas. I will stick to the Embrace to reach all places.", "I first got the Venus Gillette & Olay razor as a gift, at fell in love with it. The razor is ergonomic, easy to use, soft to my skin and does not cut me easily. I have very sensitive skin that breaks out with almost anything and usually gets irritated after shaving, but not with this razor. The razor has a unique bar soap above and under the razor that moisturizes the skin and allows the blades to cut the hair and not the skin. I bought the refills from Amazon as they were cheaper than any local store (also hard to find in the four count). The berry flavor is my favorite.", "Has a good scent to it but u need to keep ur skin a little wet for it to run smoothly on ur skin", "5 blades are a must.

The shipping was super late", "I purchased these for my GF. She loves the razors.\nThey are smoother than her usual disposables and does not require her to use shaving cream so it speeds up the whole process and make touch ups much quicker and easier.\n\nThe moisturizer is definitely a plus, It leaves the skin really smooth and soft. Also it appears that these blades to not cause any nicks or in grown hairs like others would.\n\nThe scent is subtle and kind of a bonus but for the extra money compared to unscented it does seem a bit much but if you don't mind the extra couple of bucks I say go for it.\n\nI would highly recommend this product.", "Read reviews and was skeptical.

On an off chance i tried these and within two days my stomach felt normal again, and the obsessive cravings for sweets stopped. Is been several weeks and I feel so much better. Not sure what the recommendaed dosage is but I take 1 capsule three times a day.", "I did alot of research on gut health and this product was recommended on a lot of forums. However, i reluctantly purchased the product ( reluctant because of price) and was really looking forward to seeing benefits. However, I didn\u2019t feel different at all. Very disappointing", "I am going to get really direct here. If you don't want to hear about bowel habits, you probably don't want to read this review.\nI started taking these, because I have trouble sometimes with being very regular with my stools. Since childhood, I have tended to get constipated every week or two, feeling bloated and heavy, and having very hard stools when I could go again. I have actually had anal fissures in the past, because of how hard some stools were.\nI started taking another probiotic in the morning several weeks before I started taking this one in the evening: which has prebiotics and probiotics. At first, adding these seemed to help even more with softening stools, minimizing gas pain and bloating, and regulating me to go every day or two. I no longer have any signs of fissures. Now that I have been taking them for about 2 months, I seem to have settled back into my historical habit of only going every 3 days or so. However, it is easier to go, even though the stools are bulkier. I may go back to only taking the morning probiotics (the other type I have reviewed here), just so I am only buying 1 kind of probiotic: a) the other brand is cheaper, b) the other brand seems to help enough on its own, and c) these capsules are freaking HUGE, and sometimes difficult to swallow if they turn 'sideways' at all as I'm swallowing them. I do have a small mouth (jaw and throat). You definitely should take these with at least ten ounces of water, and I personally try to drink at least 16-20 ounces when trying to take them, to be sure they are washed down thoroughly. I drink a LOT of water every day. Adding to the bulk of my stools has not been a problem because they are enough softer (with all that water) that they rarely cause any pain at all anymore. All in all, these work to aid digestion and minimize constipation, but they are very large for me to swallow. They are in an easily recyclable glass bottle, so that is an additional advantage to these, but not enough to make up for their size and cost. If I took two of these per day, as suggested on the bottle, note that a whole bottle would last only two weeks.", "I recently had a colon resection surgery. I was suffering after it with bloating, gas, diarrhea and irregular bowel movements which was to be expected after the surgery. I was also constantly on antibiotics and other medications.

Would recommend.", "This is a great combination prebiotic/probiotic supplement. I would say that it is easy to swollen if you do not have an issue with full size capsules. It took a couple days to regulate my gut health, especially as I was taking antibiotics. There were three determining factors for me in choosing this product over various others:\n1) The capsules are vegetarian,\n2) Capsules come in a glass bottle (I try to minimize buying plastic products, m\n3) No refrigeration required.\nThe only disadvantage is the quantity (15 servings per box), if you take it as directed. If one needed to take it twice a day at full dosage, it would only last 7 7.5 days!", "I\u2019ve taken another popular probiotic for years. My gastro recommended Florastor.

And he will be on oral antibiotics for life so no end in sight for loose messy stools.

Our chiropractor recommended he try a prebiodic (something about the critters in the probiodic needing something to eat to do their job) In desperation, he gave it a try,.And it is (slowly) working. It took most of the first jar to see some improvement (remember he is still taking antibiotics) .

Price-wise these are much better than parasol (my all-time fave as they fit perfectly, are so soft, and I have no issues with the tabs staying put), only marginally better than seventh generation, and about the same as pampers pure. Performance-wise they are ok as long as you size up. We have found if we don\u2019t size up, we experience blow-outs as they run small and are short in length compared to seventh generation, parasol, and pampers pure. I also find the tabs don\u2019t stay in place and tend to overlap on my average size (but long) baby. The material is a bit stiff compared to others and you have to guess somewhat if the baby is wet as it doesn\u2019t get the \u201csoggy\u201d feeling other diapers do (and there is no wetness indicator). However, if you like the cute patterns then that may be worth it to you! :) Overall, if your babe has sensitive skin this is a better than average way to go and also high in cuteness factor. But, if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice cuteness then pampers pure has a better, stretchier fit to conform to your baby and a wetness indicator. Parasol is even softer and better-confirming than pampers in my opinion, but cost significantly more. And seventh generation is comparable in feel and form but more generously sized. In the pic is a size 2 honest diaper next to a size 2 parasol diaper for comparison.", "Absolutely love these diapers. They are a holy grail in this house. When we are forced to get a pack of huggies or pampers in emergencies it hurts lol. This diaper doesn\u2019t leak unless the baby goes through a serious pee period without a change. A blow out hasn\u2019t happened at all for me with these diapers. The cute pattern and great durability and hold is amazing. It\u2019s a bit of a upscale compared to other brands but trust me it will be worth it!!\n\nOh and another thing, when we used pampers and huggies they always left the material of the diaper around my sons private after one use. It\u2019s honestly gross and since I\u2019ve noticed this I always make sure to order honest company diapers. They never do this.", "The only disposable brand of diapers my daughter isn't allergic to. She breaks out in a rash with all other types.

A little on the expensive side but definitely nice to have. She is a highly active 2 year old who does gymnastics and runs around a lot. The only time we get blow outs are when her daddy puts the diaper on sideways.", "I love these diapers. They're soft, they're adorable, don't leak, don't irritate my little ones bum (which most diapers do) my only complaint is that 6 is my daughter's size... and they run rather small in comparison to other size 6 diapers... and 6 is the largest they go. If they made a size 7 I would use these as my new brand... But they're 6 is just a little too snug on my baby.", "I think the designs are adorable, and it looks cute on my kid's butt. I also like that they are a little more environmentally friendly. Maybe it's because the insides are made of plant material, but I didn't think it held pee nearly as well as the other brand diapers I use.

She's now just over two and starting potty learning, but still mostly in diapers, and I have a four month old as well. In this time, I've noticed the quality of honest diapers declining steadily. Last summer there was a big drop in quality with the redesign of diapers, but I stuck with them because they didn't irritate my lo's super sensitive skin, and still worked well. This past box (breakfast and trains) is appalling quality, though. They are thin, flimsy, and at least 10 of the Velcro part has come off the tab when trying to put the diaper on. It seems as though honest co have two (at least) manufacturers of diapers, because some diapers are printed with the size and lot # on the front tab, and others on the back tab. It's pretty obvious looking at the diaper and the way they're folded which are which. So I guess one (front tab, narrower fold) have really suffered a quality hit.... :(. Moving to parasol diapers now, for both girls.", "I love these diapers, I ordered again. Had no problem with tabs coming off in either case, we got the bunnies and fruit slices both times and they were great. My 18 month old daughter has VERY sensitive skin, she gets diaper rash really easily and has eczema, these and the Pampers pure are the only ones that we can use for her. These are much cheaper than the pure, though.

I often didn\u2019t have a bowel movement for days on end and that was worrisome until I started IBgard. Now, I have at least 1-3 bowel movements per day that are comfortable. I take 1 capsule in the morning along with my other medications and go about my day. I like that I only need 1 capsule per day in order to feel the effects. For me, I\u2019ve found that it works best to take it in the morning BEFORE a meal rather than after to avoid any reflux or indigestion issues. The capsule might be a bit large for some to swallow but I manage it. Other than that, it works well and seems to be worth the price!", "Physician with IBS-D here. My experience with this product has been very good. The next day after taking it for the first time I had my first normal BM in many, many months. I've found Heather's Tummy Tamers to work well also but these seem to have a better enteric coating on them. If taken on an empty stomach and with not too much water, I get no minty reflux at all. The price is more than Heather's, but I'll pay more to avoid the reflux. For those wondering about it, the reflux is because peppermint oil is a smooth muscle relaxant. That's how it works in the gut -- the gut wall is smooth muscle, and in IBS it is contracting too much or too forcefully or not in a patterned way. However, the gastroesophageal sphincter is also smooth muscle, and that is what prevents reflux. Relax it with peppermint and you get reflux. Enteric coatings work by not dissolving in an acidic environment -- like your stomach. However, if you dilute your stomach acid with food or beverage while the peppermint capsule is in there, then the coating will dissolve and you will get the reflux. Hence, take your enteric coated peppermint, whether this product or heather's, 30 minutes to an hour before eating, using enough water be sure you got it down and no more.\n\nThe \"number needed to treat\" for peppermint oil for IBS is very low -- around 2.5. That means for every 5 people treated with peppermint oil, 2 will experience benefit. That may sound like a not-so-good number, but actually in pharmacology that is a very good NNT. For comparison, the NNT for prescription antispasmodics like Bentyl and Levsin is in the 3-7 range, which is also quite good, but compare those numbers to something like Xifaxan which has an NNT of 11 and costs $900-1,800 per month and you begin to appreciate that peppermint oil is winner. And with a low cost and low side effect profile, it's almost impossible to beat from a cost/side effect/NNT combined perspective.\n\nGive peppermint oil a try. Try Heather's first if you don't have any problems with reflux as Heather's is much cheaper. IBS is multifactorial. If peppermint oil doesn't help you, then gut hypermotility or dismotility is not your problem and you will need to try something else -- FODMAP diet, prebiotics, probiotics, and EXERCISE (that one is for everyone no matter what, of course). If it helps a little, you will need something else in addition to it.

I wasn't sure about the look of the hairpin legs, but I just got them because the price was decent compared to other coffee tables I've looked at. I put them together in less than 5 min and they look perfect in my mid century style living room. They are great quality and sturdy. Nice size, perfect height for my couch. I love that they can be turn and overlapped in any way so that they fit your space perfectly. Someone else commented that the table tops are 2 different colors. I didn't really notice that until I was standing in a certain spot and the light was hitting them just right.

Still? Awfully convenient!\n\nAnd the people packing this couch in that box have gotten incredibly good at making the parts fit. The seat cushions, for example, were in plastic bags that had all the air sucked out - so they were almost completely flat. (It was pretty cool hearing the air rush back in and the cushion quickly expand.) There isn't a ton of assembly required - it took us (2 adults) 19 minutes to put it together.\n\nThe couch looks nice, and once assembled, is very sturdy. It's pretty firm/stiff right now but it might soften up over time. The cushions are still gradually filling in (the instructions say that might take 48 hours) but it's what we were looking for and just the right size. The picture of this couch does not include the tiny throw pillows that came with it. They are really small and kind of cheesy looking - and given the \"leather\" surfaces - have a tendency to slide off the couch - are kind of silly.

While I was a bit concerned about the fact that \"some assembly required\" was part of the deal (IKEA nightmares still haunt me), this was literally a sinch to put together; it took less than 45 minutes... without a single tool.\nThe seating is firm and comfortable, and the color-matching throw pillows are a very nice touch.\n\nSome notes for your consideration:\n1) It comes in a package weighing a bit more than 100 lbs, so be prepared to get some help lugging it inside. MY delivery man thoughtfully pulled it up most of the steps to my front door. I suggest assembly close to where it will wind up.\n2) The instructions are not 100% clear (probably not the best translation from the country of origin), but the pictures make it quite easy to follow.\n3) They suggest that it takes 2 people to put together, but I did it myself. The only tricky part was inserting the back into the appropriate spots on the base, and with a bit of fiddling, that was done without much trouble.\n4) I'd suggest NOT tightening the hand bolt all the way (which secure the back to the sides) until both bolts are loosely attached. As the instructions suggest, be careful to avoid stripping the threads.\n\nI'm amazed at how rich this looks, given the suggested MRP.", "I just turned the basement into a playroom for the kids and needed a little seating area. This Loveseat is perfect in so many ways. The size is big enough for 2 adults to sit comfortably. Yet, it is small and didn't leave a big foot print. Perfect for a small apartment. It's very modern looking, I could definitely see this in a Manhattan apartment. The Essex Grey is a beautiful choice. It's also perfect for someone just starting out.\n\nThe cushions were packed airtight inside the couch so they came out clean and perfect. They fluffed up quickly. I didn't find assembly to be too difficult. After all is said and done you have this cute sofa that comes with matching throw pillows. I love that the back cushions are held in place by velcro. This is useful with children! This is actually really comfortable. You wouldn't think so for the price, but it's made by a mattress company, so I guess that helps.

Having a 1 year warranty I wasn't worried about a repair bill but knew it must be a simple fix and being handy I was able to remove the top of the washer and discovered the the tube between the solenoid and the water outlet wasn't sealed properly. A quick cleaning of the original adhesive and using some contact cement worked beautifully and no more leaking. Aside from that minor hiccup the washer has worked flawlessly. Very happy and highly recommend this unit. Still gets 5 stars from me.\n\nOriginal review - I purchased this washer after living in my studio apartment for 5 years and having only a single shared community washer and dryer for 12 other units.\n\nI used to have to wait until later in the evening to gain access to the wash room due to a wash addicted tenant who would do several loads about 5 days a week, and occasionally leaving her wash unattended overnight. I had no idea washers of this size even existed until I did some casual browsing here on Amazon one evening. Knowing I had a small unused area next to my bathroom sink of about 19\" wide, I searched for options and was considering a dual tub countertop machine when I came across this Magic Chef unit. The dimensions would fit exactly where my available space was with about 1\" on both sides and a couple inches from the rear. The small size is perfect for singles but might prove to be just slightly too small for 2 people unless you are ok with doing a couple loads to get everything done.\n\nThe unit is very quiet, including the wash cycle complete beep. No one seemed to describe it but it's definitely not something that might alert neighbors and less quiet than the beep a microwave makes when it's done. Although not recommended, I do have mine on a carpeted area and haven't noticed any vibration except one time when I think I overloaded the tub. I'm still learning how much to fit, but about 1/2 of the tub seems to be ideal which is a couple jeans or 5-6 t-shirts, etc.\n\nInstallation was a breeze which only involved removing the aerator from my bathroom faucet, and replacing it with the quick adapter, attaching the single water line to the washer and the other end to the quick adapter and tightening. I used a velcro strip I had laying around here to attach the drain hose to the water line and aimed it at the drain for the sink so it is aimed at the drain. You can use a zip tie or something else if you need a quick way to secure the drain line without using the \"U\" shaped hook.\n\nI also purchased the small 1.5 cu ft. dryer\n  Magic Chef MCSDRY15W 1.5 cu. ft. Laundry Dryer, White\nto go along with this unit and will write a more comprehensive review on that page but I did want to touch on it for a moment and say that I feel they really compliment each other since a full load in the washer is pretty close to the capacity of the dryer although the dryer does take a fair bit longer to dry a load than it takes the washer to complete a cycle (~30 minutes for the washer to 60-70 minutes for the dryer). You really can't go wrong with this combination if you have limited space and a lack of hookups.", "I got this washer on sale..it's great for one person. Besides clothes I wash sheets and a bunch of various things in this little washer..Just be realistic it washes like half a load at a time. I also noticed people say you can only change the settings on the heavy cycle.. but I have been able to change the settings on the heavy and gentle cycle.. like the amount of wash time.. rinse cycles..and spin time..I just push the gentle cycle button.. then the wash button to desired time...push the rinse cycle button to the amount of rinse cycles I want. Then push the spin cycle button to the amount of time I want..then the start button.. Maybe my machine is different? sometimes the machine goes off balance on spin cycle.. so I just take the clothes out re-sort and put them back in..and it is usually stops the machine from shaking.. It's usually when I put heavy loads in..also I thought I would have to buy a dryer for it.. but it actually spin dries really well.. and I hang my clothes to dry on a clothes rack..and they are dry the next day.. if the clothes are wrinkled I just use Downy Wrinkle spray..or I iron the clothes to get those wrinkles out.. with covid and the fact that my apartment washer and dryer kept going out of order..and not having bleach or other peoples clothes interacting with mine..I decided to buy a portable washer...I wish I had sooner.. it's so easy convenient ...and easier to wash clothes as much and when I want while not having to leave my place..This machine is great.", "We have property in Utah that we stay on in our motor home. We needed a washing machine that was lightweight and portable. This machine works great. We connect the machine to a standard/typical garden hose connection which involves no special fittings. It does get cold where we are located so I added a gallon of RV anti freeze to the machine and filled the machine the rest of the way with water (approx one more gallon) until the machine started (setting was on small load). Make sure to open the plug on the back bottom of the washer to drain any remaining liquid out when the cycle is complete. Hopefully everything will work properly when we return next summer but so far so good.", "This is an awesome washer! I purchased a different portable washing machine first and it broke within the first 30 days. And while I can't recommend that washer I will say the company was great about refunding. But that's a different review :-) This washer works just like a full size washer except you have to hook it up to a faucet every time you want to use it. Minor inconvenience that beats having to go to the laundromat. I do 4-5 loads of laundry each week and I've had this since September and have zero complaints! Obviously your loads need to be smaller but not a big deal. For example when I wash queen size sheets I wash the fitted sheet and a pillow case in one load and the flat sheet and second pillow case in a second load. There are 3 load sizes, & 5 program types (I use rapid, which takes 19 minutes). The water temp is determined by what water you turn on. Perfect solution for a small place without a washer & dryer hookup. I can't leave my washer by the sink so I got this cart to make it easier to move around: >Move-It 3366 23-Inch x 19-Inch Rectangle Wood Platform Dolly, 400-lb Load Rating", "This little machine is both compact and powerful. I love how easy it is to use, how well it handles the laundry, and how quiet it is. We barely notice that the machine is running and have seen little difference in our electric bill. To be able to do a load of laundry without going to the laundromat - especially during this COVID-19 stay-at-home - is a true blessing. Do not shy away from this machine, it is sturdy, quiet, efficient and well worth the money spent - a big savings when you think of how much you would spend at the laundromat! We have done towels, jeans, blankets, and regular clothes in the machine with no issue at all. It fits easily onto the kitchen sink, fills and empties quickly and efficiently, and gets things clean! You cannot go wrong with this washer.", "It arrived in four days and in excellent condition. No dents on the exterior box at all. Always a good sign. We\u2019re really pleased with this little washer. Spins very dry. Very stable and extremely quiet. No vibration. We added better water hoses so there\u2019d be no possibility of kinking. We also bought a 2\u201d deep drip tray. Just in case. No problems whatsoever thus far. We have this in our fifth wheel RV. No more crowded and hot laundry room! I think a complete set of queen sheets at one time would be too big. Other than that, this little thing holds a good sized load. Highly recommend this washer.", "This is the best washer we have ever owned. It does a wonderful job cleaning your clothes & is gentle so your clothes don\u2019t get hurt or get worn out. This model is the smallest one they have. It holds about 1 set of clothes per load. A pair of pants, shirt maybe 2, socks, underwear & a undershirt. If you wash towels, I usually put one large towel in, then fill the rest with smaller items like wash rags or dish towels. Towels are heavy when wet so that\u2019s why I only do 1 large one at a time. This will make the washer last longer. For us this size works, because we live in our 40ft Bus & this size fits in our shower perfect & it\u2019s so lightweight it\u2019s easy to take out when we need the shower.", "I bought this knowing I wanted to eventually go off grid. I love it . I am finally living off grid and we hooked up a pump and generator and my clothes are clean, the machine runs great. We use it for two people no problem, I think the only thing it won't handle is our thick comforters. I highly recommend it.", "I really like this washer at the time of ordering this machine I wasn't able to find the next bigger size, it is very easy to use washes your clothes very clean and it is also very quiet. I recommend this machine to anyone who is living in a small apartment. I'm thinking about purchasing the next bigger size though.", "Love it! Great size for small loads. I added a Y connector to the water inlet to allow hot/cold. Just a little heads up...I was having problems with my hot water heater. I couldn't get hot water, just warm. I installed a new HWH and it still did the same thing. THEN I read online a comment from an apartment building owner that had a tenant that was having the same problem. The owner installed a new HWH but the tenant was still experiencing lukewarm water. Upon further investigation, the owner found an apartment size washing machine with a Y adapter on the inlet valve. Apparently, the water was running through the Y adapter before it moved through the water lines and the washer valve was mixing the hot and cold water before moving on. So I turned off the water supply to my washing machine and VIOLA I have all the hot water I need. So, if you experience this problem, just turn the water off at the valve.", "I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it is very easy to overfill and when that happens it sounds like a monster truck. It also took us 2 hours to figure out how to hook up but that could just be the unique situation in our tiny apartment", "...be prepared that you're only going to get 1 pair of jeans and maybe 1 shirt in per load. It's fine handling a weeks worth of socks and underwear or maybe 3-4 t-shirts, but as far as jeans, sweatshirts, really any bulky items, it doesn't work too well. And anything that is super dirty, plan to soak things for a bit, as it being less robust than a full size washing machine it doesn't have the same power when it comes to agitation.", "I live in a 5th wheel. I used to do my laundry at my daughters house. After Covid-19 came that was no longer an option. I never even knew this small washer even existed or I would of bought a long time ago. This washer is compact enough that it doesn\u2019t take up much room and most important it doesn\u2019t use much wattage under 300 watts which is important for a full timer. This washer runs perfectly so don\u2019t hesitate to buy if you have a need for a compact washer.", "I do not know who gave less than 5 stars !!\nThis is absolutely the best washer ever. I think it is even better than my regular size miele washing machine.\nIf you hook it up to your faucet you can control water temperature. I have received it yesterday and already washed all my bath towels ( 3 each wash) cloth diapers( 30 hemp inserts) white load ( 7 adult tshirts, socks underwear and i could fit more)\nNo more going to laundromat!!! This washer will pay off in a month.\nI do not care i will have to wash every other day!\n\nWasher is quiet ( you can realy only hear pump pumping out water during the spin) not much noise. When I close my bathroom door i can hardly hear it.\n\nGuys you will not regret! This is a little magic washer!", "I do not recommend this product if you are a busy person and need a reliable product to ease your lifestyle. This machine is very finicky. The manual says clean out lint trap and drain pump once a month. CHECK THE MACHINE AFTER EVERY USE. Make sure connections are SECURE after EVERY USE. No one tells you this but the drain hose is cheap and you have to make sure it's not too low or too high for the drain pump to actually drain or else the washer continues to fill up and drain without spinning. I also don't recommend using if you are on the top floor of an apartment. I turned my back for one min and the drain hose slipped off the sink and onto the floor dumping out my wash water all over the floor leaking into the apartment below. This machine has cost me $300 including accessories as well as flooding damage I owe my landlord. A VERY EXPENSIVE learning lesson.", "I received my tiny washer and no joke it's small but don't let the size turn you away. I had 2 weeks worth of clothes to wash, i was hesitating to go down to the laundry mat. So i was able to wash everything! of course not in one shot and it took awhile to wash what i had but i did it! The heavy stuff is like the linens (towels, blankets, comforters) this is heavy and you can put maybe two blankets but be careful because it will move the washer a bit. So i'm happy with my choice and i believe you will be too. I hooked it up myself in the bathroom sink, and i'm constantly watching the water doesn't spill over. But it's all good! Now i'm thinking where can i put a dryer....", "The Washer I received from the seller not only arrived a week early but came in perfect condition. I give this washer a perfect 10. One hose to screw in. Press a button and let it do it's work. Perfect for a single person household. Washes just as good as a full size. Spin dry just as good. Holds a pair of jeans few garments and towel easy. Installed it where the old washer was. Thank you guys so much!", "easy to use . No issues so far. Did 4 loads yesterday!", "This is a really good washer. My only complaint is that I cannot get all of the drain water out of the hose after finishing all my washing. When I'm ready to wash a couple weeks later, water always comes out of the drain hose and spills onto the floor. Minor clean-up so this is really not a big problem considering how clean my clothes come out of the washer.", " I purchased this portable washing machine in February, to avoid the price tag on a full size machine. So far it has worked wonders. It works just as well as a full sized machine, just a bit smaller loads. I have a family of five(my wife and I and 3 kids) and we wash on sundays. It\u2019s quiet, only runs your cold water, and doesn\u2019t take too much soap to get clothes clean. We bought the magic chef portable dryer to go with this. And they work well together. We only have to go to the laundromat for the big blankets we use in the winter."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B073ZKS7MD", "title": "Camco Multi-Purpose Shoe Tray with Anti-Slip Pattern \u2013 Perfect for Holding Work Boots, Tools and Pet Accessories; Protects Your Floor from Messes; Also Great for Gardening and Outdoors!

I'm so-so on Tracfone having been a customer for many years. Their customer service is poor but the price is very attractive.

They told me they aren't doing 3G anymore but only when I called and spent over an hour with Tracfone customer service trying to fix my 3G phone.

I honestly don't know what I did without this product prior to finding it. Oh that's right, I had to rely on Depends Adult Diapers, and those were just horrible! I won't go into all the ways on that but am just thrilled I never have to go back to them! Always Discreet is perfect on essentially every level... pretty design, nothing like a \"diaper\" at all.

A few things, you probably want to go up a size. If you deliver vaginally, you'll want room for the ice packs.... trust me. If you have a csection, you'll want the waistline to come up above your incision. My last delivery was csection and I wish I'd had these, they would have provided a lot more comfort. I almost didn't go up a size as I hate things which don't fit just right, but I'm really glad that I listened to other reviewers and did.\n\nThis delivery was vaginal and I'm so grateful that I had them this time. They feel much more secure than what the hospital provides and are much softer on tender areas.\n\nThey aren't at all stylish, they feel like what they are. It is still a step up from your other postpartum options. I will say that they are undetectable under tight jeans, so that's a plus.\n\nI did take one star off for the smell. They stink.

When I put these on I was so excited because I finally felt secure. I felt like I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about anything leaking or bleeding through for once.\nBut I should mention that I cannot say anything to the actual absorption because I put my pads on top of this, because you can just never be too sure. But everything stayed in place no matter how much I moved around so I had a great mentality, regardless of the pain I was going through. Though I can tell you how utterly soft they feel. I won\u2019t lie, I found myself rubbing my hands on the outside of it more than once. They just feel too good.\nFor a size reference, I normally wear an xl in underwear and the large size of these fit me perfectly. Also, I can say that these are not low rises. They are more of a mid rise because they cover a bit of your stomach. I was surprised but I don\u2019t hate it, just more of that really comfortable material to feel.\nThe one downside I can think of is that at the end of the day when coming home from work, it tends to get really itchy. To be fair, I get that feeling with most pads I wear purely because my hair wants to have a field day getting stuck to the fibers of the pad.

I started to think I was going to have to come up with an alternative to tampons, but now I don\u2019t. Heavy flow ladies that need a real tampon, this is it!", "I've been using these for literally years and I happened to notice the review section the other day, so I just felt the need to throw my support behind this product as it's always been an excellent one for me. I've personally not had issues with leaking unless I wait too long to change one, and I have ridiculously heavy periods. I recently started wearing bamboo period underwear (also from Amazon) with them just for added protection for when I'm unable to stop and get to a restroom, and while they weren't really necessary they really help with peace of mind. I don't think they're difficult to use, nor do they pinch (never had that happen to me at least) - not the plastic ones, anyway. I tried to go down that road with cardboard but I find cardboard applicators impossible and really messy.\n\nBefore I used these, I used to have UTIs and yeast infections constantly. Someone asked me if I'd ever tried switching to organic tampons, because regular cotton is grown with a lot of pesticides and other stuff that can irritate sensitive vaginal tissue. I made the switch to organic and the difference was night and day. The few times I've had to use a regular tampon since, I could literally feel it burning my skin. I had probably just become so used to the irritation before that I never even noticed it. I've tried several brands of organic tampons but have always come back to these since finding them. They feel and perform, in my opinion, indistinguishably from regular tampons.", "I ordered these because they were the only ones I could find that had organic cotton as the only ingredient. After finding out my old tampons contain titanium dioxide/pigment white 6, I wanted to switch and I found these. The applicator is a little flimsy and the overall absorbency isn\u2019t great for heavy flow (on my first day using size super, I should\u2019ve gotten super plus), but if changing it more often is the sacrifice I need to make for all natural organic ingredients then so be it.", "Maybe it's the way these are made... just don't protect against leaks or absorb the way they should.

I ended up in moving the organic tampons into the Kotex applicators to insert them! What a mess!\n\nTo the Makers of this brand \u2026 love your product but is not consumer friendly!\nPlease look the length of the applicator of the Super plus Kotex brand .. which would be for an average woman.\n\nThanks!", "This is my go-to choice for organic tampons. I love that it's a plastic applicator for ease of use.", "My first time trying organic tampons. I had hoped for a bit more. They came in plastic packaging. I definitely don't recommend them for days with a heavier flow.", "Smaller box than expected", "We all know Prime shipping is fast, love it came in 2 days. The product looks just like the ad. Absorbency was good, but I also don't have SUPER heavy menstruals, so this is subjective. Ok so,\u203c\ufe0fFor the purpose of the review this will be a little TMI... we are talking about tampons after all.\u203c\ufe0fI'm not a big fan of the compact size. It's definitely shorter than the regular tampon, but that never seemed to bother me with the Tampax pocket radiance or Kotex compact brands. However, I prefer more organic options now. With the applicator being so short, initially it was hard to get it a comfortable distance up and away from the vaginal opening and still push the end to release the tampon seamlessly - it took a good bit of trying. Furthermore, I couldn't laugh or cough too hard afterwards, because anything that'll make those floor muscles contract will push it down and out; and a tampon that sits too low in the canal can be and was uncomfortable. The second tampon insertion was easier, but still lower than I'd like. You can try using the empty applicator or a finger to reposition it higher, but the tampon is so DRY that it's uncomfortable. I don't have issues with dryness, so I know it was the tampon, plus the menses wouldn't allow for vaginal dryness anyway... either way you're lubricated.\n\nI love the Rael Organic brand, but it was a tad more expensive than these; next time I'll pay the extra money.", "I've tried a few other brands of tampons and like Organyc the best. Everyone's millage with these types of products will vary, but as someone who has short but heavy periods I find these very affordable and absorbent (I have only tried the supers). I used to use Seventh Generation (regular and super) and while they worked well and are a much better choice over conventional brands, I did not like they were not 100% organic (the \"sewing thread\" is not).\n\nThe only negative I have is the tampons are individually wrapped in plastic. I hope Organyc considers switching to paper, and even offering a wrapper free version. Also some people may be put off by the plastic applicator, however I have had too much trouble with the cardboard ones (including Seventh Generation's on occasion) leading to wasted product and messy hands. And forget about applicator-free. They do claim the applicator is plant based at least, however I do not know enough about that technology to know if it is greenwashing or not. But so far Organyc seems to be a good choice for me and I will continue using them.\n\n(note: Organyc does make tampons with cardboard applicators as well)", "These are advertised as cardboard applicator; however, They are plastic. I have used organic brand cardboard applicator for years and love them. They have been unavailable on Amazon since Jan 2022. I ordered these and was disappointed when they weren\u2019t as advertised.", "I\u2019m sad for those who have found the applicators difficult and/or painful to use regularly. That\u2019s sucks! I haven\u2019t found that issue with these, at least not consistent enough for it to be a problem. Although the applicator can sometimes pinch and sometimes be annoying.... I haven\u2019t noticed it more than another brand. I have this issue once to a couple of times a month with every brand but it\u2019s not an every insertion problem by any means. As I said, this is something I notice with every brand I\u2019ve used... even Tampax pearl which is prob the smoothest I\u2019ve tried. ANYWAY... the absorbency is great. Seems comparable. I have extremely heavy days to very very light days. I use these Super Plus day one and the first two nights. I\u2019ve had less leaking since adding this size to my monthly routine. I like that they are organic and that the applicator is partially made of plants. I have all sizes in my subscribe and save and I haven\u2019t seen a cheaper price point. Give them a try!", "These tampons are great. I have Endometriosis and that means I have really unpredictable periods. I have tried a lot of different tampons. And the name brand ones have chemical irritants in them, so I switched to organic cotton tampons. I usually use Veeda brand ones, but with the virus, I wanted to see if I could find ones to be delivered to my house. I subscribed to these and I find these to be just as good as the Veeda brand. Due to Endo, I do have to change them more often then someone whom doesn't have endo, but that is normal for me. No tampoms last many hours for me, at least not the first couple days. But these are absorbent enough that I can actually go places and get errands done without thinking that I need to go to the bathroom immediately to change them. If you do not have a condition like endometriosis, these will definitely last longer for you.", "I really liked this product. It worked exactly as it should and had great protection and have not had to worry with leaks.\nI only wish it was more eco friendly by using less plastic, like eliminating the plastic wrapper.", "One of the better options for feminine supplies.", "I've been using these for some time now and generally like them, but my most recent order (specifically the regular) seem to be defective. I've wasted so many because the applicator is not releasing the tampon.", "Rounder tip please.", "It's unfortunate that the only thing offered to purchase is the compact version of these, the original ones with the cardboard applicator were much better quality and more comfortable. The compacts are much wider & not as long, and there is no outside lining on these, it's just cotton, so the fibers easily pull off of the tampon (imagine where they end up.) So, I'll no longer be buying these - with all the changes of the compact version I dont feel that they are comfortable and hygienic.\nAnother note worth mentioning is the awful packing via Amazon. Since I started buying feminine products on amazon, over the past year I've had to return 3 shipments due to being crushed, fallen out of the box, torn, and or waterlogged. The last order I received was shipped in one of those ultra thin amazon bags, needless to day the tampon boxes were crushed.

I often use this size cup for tempera paint with the aforementioned grade levels. When multiple kids are snapping lids on and off of my souffle' cups, and I'm refilling them for the next group's use, the other cups I've bought in the past have collapsed (literally) under the weight of the demands put on them.

We\u2019re a family of ten so the 200 cup sample we received won\u2019t last long. I keep them in the cupboard with our dishes and use them nearly everyday. Our kids tend to use way more condiments than they need and these cups go a long way towards keeping that in check. We use them to give each of the kids a single portion of ketchup, bbq sauce, maple syrup, dressing, and soy sauce. They can always have more if they want it but these cups mean our six year old doesn\u2019t go right to dumping 5oz of syrup on a plate of pancakes. I also use them to dole out candy, one little cup of chocolate or other candy is an appropriate serving for a younger child. I know I buy a bag when we run out since they\u2019ll more than pay for themselves in preventing food waste without the hassle of washing a bunch of little reusable dishes.", "Note: These do not have lids.\nI love having these on hand. I use them for several things that they work well for.\n\nI use them in meal plates for salad dressings, ketchup, tartar sauce, tahini sauce, barbeque sauce, and sour cream. I also find that clean up is easier with kids' meals if I put their ketchup in these on their regular dinner plates.\nWhen packed with salad or burgers, they are clean and can nestle alongside food, then be taken out in case the rest of the food needs reheating. It allows everyone to control their own condiments.\n\nMy son has another use for these and often asks for a sleeve for himself - and that's for resin casting.

The lumbar portion, like 95% of all chairs, is not right for a spine-damaged patient without a modification: I want a completely flat hard surface like a floor, spinal flexion makes my feet/legs numb and burning.

They are a little flimsy but not as flimsy as some other boxes I\u2019ve used. I\u2019m a home baker and make lots of cupcakes and need something durable and easy to put together. They are easy to put together, the only thing I don\u2019t like is the way they close. It has this tab part that\u2019s suppose to hook in and it can tear pretty easy.

I realized though if I trim the \"feet\" of the cupcake insert on all sides it does the trick. It makes it so that it will still hold my cupcakes in place, but will do so without lifting over my cupcakes and making a mess of my frosting. It's not a super sturdy box, so it's best to hold with two hands on the bottom. But if you're just giving a dozen cupcakes here or there these would be good. But if you need to transport a bunch of these boxes at the same time, I wouldn't recommend these. Look for a more sturdy option.", "I purchased these boxes for Mother's Day.

I\u2019ve yet to assemble one of these that did not tear during assembly as the cardboard is extremely thin. Sad I have so many of these, off to recycling they go.", "These cupcake boxes are elegant, sturdy, and easy to use. My only issue is that the insert for holding the cupcakes is a little high, so that it went over top of the cupcake wrappers a few times, messing up the frosting and making the cupcakes hard to get out. I will probably trim the inserts a bit next time.", "It would be very helpful to have box assembly instructions included. Spent 20 minutes of trial and error to learn the correct way.", "They hold together well, though the bottom is somewhat flimsy. My main issue with these is the insert. The inserts were so tall that I had to trim each one in order to keep the cupcakes in place and keep the frosting from getting messed up. This was a last second issue I did not need or want when packaging an order for a wedding. I will not order these again and will look elsewhere.", "These boxes are excellent.

If you have to use non-scented detergents like my family, it\u2019s an absolute necessity.\n\nImportant Information: My entire family has sensitive skin but my sons\u2019 sensitivies are severe enough that I can only use free&clear detergents so my review is based on my experience with a laundry detergent that offers literally no scent.\n\nPROS:\n- Safe for ALL skin types, including extremely sensitive skin and/or eczema\n- Ridiculously easy to use, pour beads into cap and cap into washer\n- Safe for any material you can put in your washer\n- Scent control by adding more or less beads to each load\n- Scent is fresh but not overwhelming to the senses\n- Freshens the entire laundry room as a side perk\n- Fresh smelling for up to 6 weeks (I can verify 3 weeks and counting so far from personal experience)\n\nCONS:\n- Honestly, there really aren\u2019t any...it can seem expensive but it\u2019s not for what it gives you, especially if you can\u2019t use scented detergents\n- If you are sensitive to smells like I am, just choose a scent you are familiar with and can handle and start adding more and more beads to test tolerance with each load\n\nSo, to my actual experience with this god send. It\u2019s great that I know no one is being exposed to any excess chemicals but these detergents \u2014 and if you use them you absolutely know what I\u2019m talking about \u2014 do NOT leave your clothes smelling \u201cfresh out of the washer\u201d.

I tried spraying the clean clothes with Fabric Refresher before and after the dryer but this also faded and smelled forced. I don\u2019t have time to research essentials oils and what nots with 2 kids and, quite frankly, it shouldn\u2019t be that difficult to get good smelling laundry. If all of that wasn\u2019t enough, I have chronic migraines and I have to be exceptionally careful with scents because too much of even a good one can lead to a very bad day for me.\n\nSo, I saw ads and promos for this type of thing before but honestly didn\u2019t think that it could work or would work, was worried about whether it would irritate my kids\u2019 skin, and if it was safe for everything or if I was gonna have to add another task to my pre-laundry summit, and finally if I was going to be playing Russian Roulette loaded with migraines. However, after one particularly horrifying potty training mishap, I was so frustrated By the fact I couldn\u2019t get my son\u2019s blanket smelling clean, I broke down and bought it. BEST DECISION I HAVE EVER MADE.\n\nAfter getting it, I was super excited to try it (see Pros above). The first time I tried it, I used half of a cap full because I wanted to check how strong the scent was (and I knew I was gonna wash that bedding a second time anyway). After the washer cycle was done, my entire laundry room smelled amazing and so did the blanket. It smelled fresh and clean and it wasn\u2019t an overwhelming scent. I got nervous about how it would last after the dryer but the smell held and it continued to last throughout the entire week. I\u2019ve used it in every single load since and it\u2019s amazing the difference \u2014 I don\u2019t dread laundry, I don\u2019t worry that clean clothes don\u2019t smell clean, and the scents last for weeks (found that out after washing winter blankets to prep for the upcoming season - 3 weeks in storage tub and counting) with added bonus of an awesome smelling laundry room to boot. I\u2019ve used it on towels, dress shirts, bedding, jackets, and t shirts ofnjust about every machine washable material I can conceive of and it does not cause any damage what so ever.\n\nThis product is awesome and I\u2019m so happy I finally tried it.

They kind of had the feel of similar material of like windbreaker track pants almost. I was planning on returning them but my fianc\u00e9 told me just wear them a day or two to give them shot. Boy was I glad I listened to her! These are by far the best Dockers I\u2019ve ever owned! These pants are very durable, breathable and comfortable! Very nice looking pants to be used for business casual or to dress to impress for that big interview! Absolutely love the security pocket on the right side above the normal pocket that you can zip shut for those important items you don\u2019t want to loose. Also I really like the design of the normal pockets too because they are more flatly lined or shaped for a lack of words to describe better. Just keeps your things securely in pockets compared to older designs. Overall very happy with these pants, have bought quite a few pairs since these!", "I can do anything in these - go to the office (assuming it's a more casual day); hit up the bars, or go hiking. I have an athletic build, and they are slim fit - if you have thighs and glutes, they will show your thighs and glutes. I walk to work every day, about 2 miles - and they are the exact type of pants I wanted. Something stretchy, fitted, and durable to handle a lot of movement (and something that will dry fast on hot days). People complaining they're too tight don't seem to grasp the definition of slim-fit. No noticeable shrinkage for the grey pair, perhaps a slight reduction in length on the green ones (I own four pairs - 2 greys, one green, one tan). I wish they'd release more 32x32 for the other colors - I bought the tan ones in 32x34 and I'll probably get them hemmed.", "Here's what you need to know, gents:\nFeatures:\n+Very comfortable, especially in hot weather, due to polyester material.

You're informed ahead of time, so don't complain about the pants looking girly like the other reviewer.\nCons:\n-Back pockets are overlapped so it's hard to get your wallet in and out. Hard to keep my pocket knife clipped. I moved my pocket knife to the front pocket.\n-It has that \"hiking pants\" look, especially in the British Khaki color. The other colors look more \"normal\".\n\nPhotos are of size 32\" x 29\".", "Good slim fit. Got the 30x30. Not too tight on thighs and legs. Hips and waist could use a little wiggle room.

After doing some research I settled on Softbums Hpods to use as disposable inserts. Even though their website it up and I ordered from them, I never received my items so I was stuck trying to find another disposable insert. Pampers used to have some (exclusively at Target) but discontinued them. Hybrid systems are a great alternative to putting more waste in landfills and Pampers suggested using Charlie Banana inserts, so I relented and bought them. (I've been using Honest diapers normally).\n\nFirst off, I'm not sure why inserts are more expensive than an entire diaper, which has more material, adhesive tabs, etc. These are even more expensive than an Honest diaper, and these inserts are made in China to boot. I used them several times but I was not impressed with the absorbency. When I would change my boy it felt like the moisture was very close to the surface and against his skin, instead of getting wicked away like in normal diapers. They were ALWAYS saturated too, even though I checked and changed more frequently, because I didn't have that blue line on the exterior telling me he was wet. The quilting on the pad isn't very deep, and I wonder if that is the problem...?\n\nThe good news is the size seems to fit my Flip covers perfectly.\n\nReally wanted to like these, and perhaps doubled up they might work, but that would be really expensive and kind of defeat the purpose.", "I was using a different, more natural insert until it was unavailable for a long period of time. That's when I discovered Charlie Banana. It's a nice alternative to what I was using. Though it's a little long, it still gets the job done without traces of those pesky little gel breads stuck to my baby after him wearing it all night. I won't go near Sposie for that reason. This is a good fix.", "These Charlie Banana diaper inserts are a good thing to have when nighttime diapers are not absorbent enough by themselves. By combining these with his regular diapers, baby now has a night of great absorption, tranquility and well-being while we get more sleep (hopefully).\nThe shape of these inserts is long, almost gigantic, but they are quite absorbent and cover the entire back and front of my baby. They can be used in conjunction with cloth or disposable diapers, I use them for both and they work well in both cases. The insert pads are soft and flexible, and allow for the actual diaper to last a while longer. I think they are convenient for overnight and also for long trips in the car, since I can't be checking baby that often. Convenient and useful, I am satisfied with Charlie Banana diaper inserts.", "I kind of enjoyed having these as a hybrid option between a disposable and cloth. I started out using prefolds and covers when my baby was born but when I went back to work cloth was just to hard. These were nice for allowing me to use all my cloth diaper covers which I really love because they are so cute. I also find that cloth diaper covers with either hybrid inserts or cloth contain blowouts much better so that\u2019s a big plus. The one downside to these is I don\u2019t feel like you are saving much material from an eco standpoint. These inserts are not much less material than a full disposable diaper. I would recommend for someone that has and enjoys using cloth diaper covers but can\u2019t fully commit to the cloth for whatever reason.", "The packaging oddly talks about the qualities of the actual diapers, which is not what this product is. It also says something silly like \"contains a low percentage of super absorbent material\".....I think that is a typo. The good is that it is pretty absorbent, and it contains the mess on something that can be tossed in the trash as opposed to fighting with the actual liner of the diaper to get the mess off. The bad is it does have an odor even if it claims there is no perfume. It also breaks down pretty quickly, like with a lot of urine, so little bits stick to your baby. However, it is probably good that it breaks down quickly since that is the point of using cloth diapers, you are conscientious of the environment, therefore it's good to know it will break down quickly. I definitely recommend these at least for when your baby is in the \"messy\" diaper stage.", "Summary: When it comes to diapers, there are either cloth (reusable), or disposable. Then liners came along, and that added to the available solutions. These disposable inserts appear to be the next iteration of an age old problem.\n\nObservations: I'm on the fence whether this is a viable solution. A few reviews mention this as a \"travel option\" where you could have these, and dispose of them while traveling. While this sounds like a possible solution, why not just opt for disposable diapers, and not have to integrate a 3rd solution.\n\nPros: Smaller than a full disposable, so that it can fit inside a cloth diaper.\n\nCons: Cost, at $16 for 32, that's $0.50/each, which is just about the same cost as a full disposable diaper.\n\nConclusion: At $16, rating this 4-stars, but highly recommend thinking through this alternative solution.", "These are convenient for some use, but they kind of defeat the purpose of a cloth diaper. It's probably easier to just disposables in a pinch when needed. But if the option is a must, these are handy. However, with the CB brand, they have to slide all the way into the pocket, which has a fabric overlay on the whole inside. These are thick and bulky.", "These are great for travel. We don\u2019t use them all the time, otherwise we might as well get a disposable. These are great for when you think you need a little extra protection on the go. The size is decently long. If you look at the picture I posted you will see the length compared to my hand. They seem to do well this far. No leaks! They aren\u2019t too thick, and stay in place until you decide it\u2019s time for them to come off.", "Review for: Charlie Banana Baby Disposable Diaper Inserts for Babies and Toddlers, Works with Most Cloth Diapers, Unscented, 32-Pack\n\nI like a lot of things about these inserts. They are great for those times when we are traveling because you can toss them rather than have to rinse them out and save til you can wash them. They fit into the diapers covers well and they are absorbent. They are unscented.\n\nWhat I don\u2019t like about them is what happens with a really messy diaper. Like the cloth diapers, they are narrow and so don\u2019t catch everything so well. Then you have pretty much the same mess to clean up as with a cloth insert. With an older toddler, these work better because it is easier to predict the next messy diaper.", "I've been having a hard time with the traditional reusable inserts in my baby's cloth diapers because they just seem huge and bulky, which makes it hard for him to hobble around. However, these are fantastic! They're so convenient to toss away when they're soiled, but also nice because we are still helping the environment by using a reusable shell. They fit perfectly and are absorbent enough to even be with him overnight. They're not big and bulky but still help keep everything where it needs to be. I'll definitely be purchasing more!!", "My 4 years old son is during his potty training period. Usually he use cloth diapers. I know he poops every morning after breakfast. And he does't has mess pooper like tiny baby anymore. So I try to use disposable insert at that time, then I don't need to wash dirty cloth diaper with pooper. It is soft but not thick. Good for solid pooper or one time pee.", "These are great for when you\u2019re on the go or traveling while still trying to cloth diaper and have as little environmental impact as possible. These work great with a simple cover. They\u2019re very soft and don\u2019t have a smell, are great for sensitive skin. They can be manipulated for smaller size diapers and layered for heavy wetters. Easy to use and dispose of. Do miss that they don\u2019t have stickies to keep in place, but honestly the ones that do stick usually don\u2019t stay put and it\u2019s less biodegradable so I actually prefer these. Will order again.", "We have a tiny tot that pees like a racehorse at night. Most diapers work during the day, some more absorbent, some less but none keep the little one dry overnight. These pads are super thick and long, I wasn't sure they would work on a size 2 diaper BUT, voila, they were amazing. Yes, they're long and have to be tucked down some but I recommend only for sleeping or maybe a plane or car ride where it's too difficult to change a baby. Clothes and sheets were dry, that's worth everything. Sure beats wrapping a size 3 over the size 2!! Efficient, absorbent, somewhat comfortable, easy to use, and disposable. Recommended", "These inserts are genius to work with the Charlie Banana diapers when on the go and you don't want to carry around dirty diapers! Absorbent and easy to insert. I like that they are a little bit more narrow than other brand inserts which means they are easier to insert and more comfortable on my 8 mo old. Since my baby is relatively young these have worked well for us and we haven't experienced any leaks when diapers are changed regularly. The inserts are soft, not too bulky and work.", "These Charlie Banana disposable diaper inserts look like giant pads for cloth diapers. It basically has the same features of winged absorbency and is sized to cover the entire front to back of the diaper. It fits perfectly into the Charlie Banana fabric diaper. I\u2019m assuming this is meant to be an accessory and not a regular use product. If anyone wanted to use disposables, it would make more sense to just use disposable diapers, since almost all brands are cheaper for an entire disposable diaper than this insert, without the trouble that comes with dealing with washing diapers. This is ideal for set ups where you and baby are already used to clothing diapers and need extra reinforcement for the road/travel/or laundry days.", "Super easy to clean up poopy diapers if you are using reusable diapers.", "For a mom who uses both cloth diapers and disposables (for night time and traveling) I thought I would love this product, the best of both worlds in a sense. Sadly I disagree with myself now, it\u2019s all the hassle (I love cloth BTW) of cloth (washing the shells) and the added trash from the disposable inserts.\nDo they work, yes technically, they catch pee but don\u2019t hold as much as a disposable diaper would. They also kept all the poop contained at least for my toddler they did.\nAs a price comparison the disposables I use cost .20 a piece and these are .50 a piece, so you pay more for these and they don\u2019t work nearly as well as a disposable. Only 1 scenario I could see these actual being efficient, you cloth diaper more than one child and those children wear different size disposables and you use these inserts so sparingly that your afraid you wouldn\u2019t use a package of diapers in that time frame (these adjust by just folding them down so they fit all sizes).", "Use these with our granddaughter in her cloth diapers. They fit into most of them. Don't cover quite everything and like others say ... not ideal if you have a messy pooper. Mind as well just use a disposable. Does make cleanup just a little easier. Don't use them all the time Use them mostly when traveling and they are nice. Work as well as other brands we use. Not perfect but not bad. No real complaints and no regrets.", "I store a few of these in my diaper bag for on the go and travel.

The applicator is still considered plastic but it is made with some environmentally friendly ingredients and process to make it break down easier/better without having to be that rough and uncomfortable cardboard. It glide in nice and smooth. Which I love because I have seen how much feminine products cause waste. This does not scarifice comfort for the environment or vise versa.

L donates period products to communities in need with every purchase and also supports non profits to make period products and education more accessible. Seventh generation donates also, 43 cents per pack up to 1 million packs. Which is cool.

If you want to feel connected to the road, the CS5 Ultra Touring does just that with the patented STABILEDGE technology. STABILEDGE technology can be found on the edge of the tread elements.

The asymmetric tread design of the CS5 Ultra Touring is designed to deliver a crisp steering response, controlled handling around curves and all-season road gripping capabilities. The specially designed 3D Micro-Gauge sipes stabilize the tread elements by interlocking them together to maximize surface contact.

These tires are great for some spirited driving better than the goodyear eagle sport tires which were cracked on the side. Grip and responsiveness is definitly noticable even in rainy weather.\n\nMy only irritations are with the tires both in the condition that they arrived and how they actually look like.\n\nAppearance: (note the picture on top shows the 'inside' tire view which has the raised lettering in the sidewall, the outside view which you will see from the car is almost entirely smooth solid color)\nDont let the pictures fool you, you will almost barely see any lettering or sidewall 'design' on the tires. It looks like a solid color rubber tube basically like the innertubes of a bike tire. I get that function is more important than looks but jeeze the display pictures are almost clickbait .. Now I am a little concerned on how long the sidewall will last before it cracks considering tires with ribbed design sidewalls and lettering last longer than almost perfectly smooth sidewalls.\n\nDelivery/condition:\nTires came from fedex because theres no way usps is going to carry these lol.

The scuffing I could get past since obviously they are going to be rubbing/tumble around during transportation but wow these were scuffed bad, havent had a chance to clean yet since its been non stop rain last few days since install but Im hoping it comes off or at least blends in. The gouging/wear on the tread was another story. Before anyone assumes I got these from a random 3rd party seller, I did not, it was direct from amazon warehouse listed under their name in NEW condition. Oem tire sticker came off ridiculously easy almost like it was just applied with dirt already under it and no residue which was a first in my experience. The only benefit of the doubt I am giving the tires is the white manufacturer lettering on the tread itself which I doubt someone would go through the hassle of trying to reproduce so I am going to trust it is indeed new. Also if you look closely at the stack of tires pictures, they all have really bad seams from the molding(?) process as if it was cheaply reproduced.

Quieter than the Pirelli P7 (I always thought they were noisy). Holds the road nicely. Lots of construction in Chicago expressways with uneven roads in the middle of paving.

I was about to go with Michelin's but at a quote of over $800 that just wasn't happening. I decided to try these Cooper tires. I'm amazed at the difference!! It's like having my ears plugged as I drove its insanely quiet! They have large sipes (grooves) to cut through rain and they dampen bumps better than I've ever seen before. They turn my Corolla into a Lexus. I did bump up a size from 215 to 225 so that probably helped but for now on I'll just use Cooper tires. These were are $25 less per tire than the Generals.

These tires are a win-win for me.\n\nGreat wet grip. No road noise and great ride. And in reference to some other reviews that I have read....all 4 of my new Cooper tires say Made in USA.\n\nWhen getting the tires mounted - there is an inside and outside.

I decided to go with the Cooper tires due to lower cost point, and guaranteed American craftsmanship. I installed them July 29th, and I was sold after just my first drive. These tires are 100% quieter that the stock Firestones. They grip the road, and you don't feel like you have to oversteer around corners. I never lose traction on any kind of takeoff, and the torque-steering issue these Jeeps have has been negated.

All four tubes are packaged by Colgate in a box - this is good for shipping. My five years kid like this paste, only variation I would want is a variety of flavors.", "Nothing to dislike about this product.", "Perfect toothpaste for kids or anyone that has a sensitivity to mint flavored toothpaste. Doesn't leave residue and rinses clean.", "This is a gel-like liquid that is the BEST toothpaste alternative for toddlers and young kids, especially when they are just transitioning from using only water on their toothbrush. I have used it exclusively for over 6 years with my three kids, and my 6 and 8 year old still use it.\n\nI love that because it\u2019s a gel-like liquid, much thinner than typical toothpaste, it doesn\u2019t gunk up their toothbrushes. It also doesn\u2019t trigger any texture issues with them like regular toothpaste would.\n\nThe watermelon flavor is also a huge plus because my kids don\u2019t like peppermint flavor. It\u2019s very hard to find a traditional toothpaste that isn\u2019t mint or another flavor that\u2019s weird/gross to them. We will use this as long as we need to!\n\nSome cons:\n\u2014The lid tends to break off after awhile and this is annoying. I wish they\u2019d improve the bottle.\n\u2014Because it\u2019s liquid, if it\u2019s stored sideways and the lid comes open, it will leak and make a huge mess. But it\u2019s pretty hard to store upright because it\u2019s so skinny.

Finished in vintage black with a slightly distressed touch, the country feel of the hall tree with storage bench looks great even beyond your entryway.

The vintage black color is a very close color to my \"espresso\" kitchen cabinets, which i love. The item is fairly easy to put together. I was surprised, of course, to find out that the back panel is not wood like the rest of the hall tree. It's that thin cardboard-type-material that you tack on with small nails. It looks really good once it's on, though. The construction otherwise is good, and it supports good weight if you want to sit on it to tie your shoes. I don't remember what the listing puts the weight limit at, but it can support a grown man approx 250 lbs with no sign of squeaking or buckling.\n\nThe overall look of this item is very good. I'm glad I purchased this, because it fits perfectly into the space intended.", "This hall stand was exactly what I wanted. It fits well into the narrow space I have in my hallway when most other benches are too wide. The back is cardboard but the seams are not visible due to the placement of the wood slats. Assembly was easy - I did it myself while watching a football game, so took about 3 quarters to complete (given my frequent stopping to watch). The shoe cubbies are a bit short so it can be hard to fit more than one pair of shoes per cubby but I still love this unit.", "We purchased this to put at our beach condo that we also use as a rental property. We placed in near the doorway so guests would hopefully place their shoes when they enter and it looks very welcoming there. I added the flip flop decals to hint for placing shoes in the cubbies and they look cute too with our other decor. There are also hooks to hang beach towels. My husband assembled it and it was very easy. All the screws and parts fit! It is sturdy and looks as the site described. Very pleased with this bench!", "Put your power tool belts on! 4 stars only because it\u2019s so affordable and ultimately cute, but just be prepared for a challenge! It is NOT easy to put together. I read the reviews of other people saying that and I shrugged it off, thinking to myself that I could totally handle it because of how many pieces of IKEA furniture I have under my belt and that the reviewers before me must be fussy wimps. Oh boy - big surprise! This is like leveling up in difficulty from a little street fight with IKEA to a minor boss battle (that maybe you didn\u2019t fully upgrade for yet). Sure, I got it done, so it\u2019s not \u201dimpossible\u201d, but man did I want to give up. I put it together myself, but definitely needed the help of a power tool to do it (screwing it all together by hand would be an ordeal). And heads up! There are no pre-drilled holes to attach the top and bottom pieces so I drilled holes for the first time in my life! It\u2019s kind of together now, but pretty wobbly, because one of the screws just wouldn\u2019t tighten and I ended up stripping it so bad that I couldn\u2019t get it in any further or out again.", "The product is as described but for some reason I expected it to be larger. The height only came a little above my light switch and looks scrawny (see pic). I was going to attach a light weight mirror to it but that just won\u2019t work.\n\nOther details.\nThis is delivered in two boxes.\nBox 1: A shoe bench as it\u2019s own separate piece of furniture.\nBox 2: The top hall tree piece.\nEach of these pieces are easy to assemble individually, but gets tricky and requires two people to attach them together. M The top piece is also not that sturdy so comes w a system to attach it to the wall to secure it.\nIt worked out that it was two pieces for me because I can use the bench without the top. Please make this decision first because once you attach\u00e9 the hall tree it will mess up the smooth surface of the bench. You have to manually screw through the top of the bench to attach the two pieces together. In my pic it is just sitting on top.\n\nFor sitting the approved weight limit is only 250 lbs.\n\nFor hanging items on hooks it is only approved for a total of 5 lbs for all 3 hooks! And 0 lbs for the very top of you wanted to use it to display any small items like a vase or frame.\n\nI like that the lower shelve are adjustable which allows you to use for whatever storage you want other then just for shoes. I added baskets to mine or might even make one a bed/cubby for my Chihuahua.\n\nThe back panel is just cardboard so you can decide if you want to attach or leave it open.", "Works for what we needed, just a little smaller than we thought it would be", "Easy to assemble - just follow the pictures and do steps in order.\nThey didn't have black in stock so I spray painted it when it was done. Added a cushion and will get some baskets for the shelves and it will work out perfectly.", "SO I've had this for about a month before writing the review. I absolutely LOVE this Hall Tree! It has the primitive look which was what I was going for! It is very stable. A little difficult to put together but Love the end product. WOuld highly suggest this to others.", "Extremely cheap. Damaged upon delivery but still usable so keep it due to unwanted aggervation to return. Looks nice just don't sit on or move it around.", "Assembly took some time, but it looks great. Color is nice as well. The back of this bench is not as sturdy though it holds the weight on the hooks pretty good (like bags, and jackets etc) you just need to keep it against the wall and not move it. Overall happy with it.", "I love it ,just that we need almost 1 hours to intalled ..", "Assembly for the most part wasn't hard, just time consuming. That is, until the last step. The last step requires you to attach the shoe organizer base to the coat hanger top. However the only guiding holes here are underneath part of the shoe base, there is nothing in the bottom of the top nor the top of the base to guide you in lining up these screws and it is EXTREMELY difficult to attach them correctly. Despite us spending over an hour on this one singular step desperately trying to get the screws to go in we ended up damaging part of the top because the screws weren't aligning. Now it wobbles when you push on the top. We are going to get Gorilla Glue to connect these parts more securely because otherwise it's not secure at all, and then we'll have to use some decor items to cover up the damages from that screw. So, that part was disappointing. I'm happy to have a wall tree, but I'd have rather spent a bit more and gotten the product built for me and delivered that way. No more flat-pack furniture for me. After this piece we have sworn to never buy another piece of flat pack furniture.", "We are very happy with the pieces in this collection we have bought. I am so glad we got it. It looks lovely and like the rest of the pieces was well made and easy to set up. Although it may be somewhat time consuming to put furniture together we were impressed with the instructions and the quality of both the furniture and the engineering of the parts and how they fit together. Keeping in mind this is pressed board and the price I paid; this piece and all the furniture I bought exceeded expectations. My partner was able to put this together efficiently and in good time. The hall tree being the piece of least quality is still a good buy and sturdy enough to hold our adult weights.", "Great value for the money and for the most part very easy to assemble. My only complaint is that the bench was made to stand alone so the the attachment to the upper unit is not very sturdy. It was difficult to attach due to no predrilled holes. It seems a little wobble but once against the wall sturdies up a bit.

I have to say I was pretty disappointed almost immediately. Out of the package. It is a nice looking 8 ounce bottle, a good quality sprayer and the packaging looks lovely as well.\n\nUnfortunately, when I started using the product, there was not much of a smell. The lavender smell was quite weak. And for all of the claims and reviews, I have to say I was disappointed. I tried it as directed for a few days, and I have to say you could smell, the item immediately after you sprayed it, but it was gone pretty quickly after that. I was not looking to cover up any strong horrific odors, there is no smoking in my home, I was not being unrealistic and trying to cover up dirty litter boxes, or unneutered male cats , etc. just trying to achieve regular housing freshness without the overwhelming smell of other products on the market.\n\nSomething that smells a little more natural, a little more power, a little more palatable people with sensitivities,\n\nSadly, this product worked immediately, but within the hour it's like I never sprayed it at all. Pretty much it's like water with a few drops of lavender smell in it.\n\nAnd I pulled out my bottle of high-quality lavender essential oil, and I added a few drops to the bottle, which greatly increased the smell, and the quality of the product, but in the end, I could've done this myself with water, a spray bottle, and my own lavender EO\n\nBecause of the packaging, and the initial nice fragrance, I will give this item 3 stars.\n\nHi, tried the item, before I diluted it with my own EO on a travel tote bag, it just smelled like it had been in the airports, on the plane, etc. so I was looking for some natural freshness, I've pretty much saturated the bags, and I put it outside to dry overnight, and the next day it smelled nicely, but it smelled mostly of the fresh air and the sunshine, the lavender smell was completely gone, I don't know if I achieved this affect because the bag was wet and allowed to dry in natural sunlight and fresh air. I do give some credit to the product. But there was still a little bit of the underlying airport/airplane smell as well. In the end, I just put it inside the washing machine and took care of that issue.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad product.

The C8 features comprehensive support of major 4K high dynamic range formats including premium Dolby Vision, as well as HDR10 and HLG.", "reviews": ["This TV is a monster of a TV. Even at 77\" i need to be about 12 inches away from the screen in order to start to discern any pixels. What that means is from any viewing distance greater than 12 inches, everything is crystal clear. That is not to say anything bad, that is to say that 4K is going to be the tech for a while, since even with 77\" 4k is more than enough pixels for viewing, its even difficult to tell if things are 4K or 2K. So when they start coming out with 8K, that's a perfect time to swoop in and buy a 4K.\n\nI did use a calibration disk to set a few of the SDR settings. You are not supposed to change the HDR settings so there is not much that i could do there. You can see my review of Spears and Munsil UHD HDR benchmark calibration disk. The SDR of the TV needed a few minor adjustments, but nothing too crazy. I have noticed that a few of my older games are particularly dark. Set your game mode with increased brightness to account for older gaming content. Do yourself a favor and make sure that the brightness and contrast are set using calibration patterns to make sure you get the true blacks OLED has to offer. I have wept openly at stores where the OLED was not properly calibrated and the blacks were gray. Such a waste of technology to make an OLED no better than LED, do not make that mistake. Calibrate! I have had it for about a month now and have noticed no problems with the panel or pixels. It does detect the HDR vs SDR signal and switch automatically, but it does not automatically switch between game and expert mode within the SDR and HDR modes there are options for both.\n\nThe speakers are surprisingly full sounding for a TV, i typically use my Klipsch RP8000F tower speakers and sound system and pass all my sound through my receiver, but i did use the TV speakers for some visual demo material before setting up the full HDMI chain. I did end up turning off ARC on the TV and use the Xbox for all smart functions, but i do not know if the problem originated with the TV or my Onkyo TX-RZ820.\n\nI was looking forward to being able to cast my screen from my device to the TV, but have been completely unable to do so. The screen share ap on the TV does not allow devices to connect. I might be an isolated case, but it would not allow any devices (phones or computers) to connect over screen share (could only share through HDMI). This is why i give 3 stars to smart features.\n\nThe TV paired easily with my Xbox One X for power control (when setting up devices such as TV with Xbox make sure you type in the model number so you get the option to turn on/off rather than just toggle). I do not use a universal remote. The TV remote app for android makes it so that i don't really need to use the LG remote and it turns on with my Xbox, i imagine setting up a universal remote would be just as easy.\n\nIt goes without saying since it is OLED, but i will say it for those who may not know: perfect blacks are beautiful. Not just dark, or can't really tell, but true black. It is important to get the true movie experience to view in as dark of a room as possible. Now this isn't to say that you need a dark room like you would for a projector (ie with projector if the room isn't dark you can't see it), the dark room is wonderful because it allows those dark spots to be truly black without reflecting light from the room, no light pollution! I use this TV all day for watching TV shows in a fully lit room without any problems, it does not struggle for brightness. The TV is bright enough to be viewed in a daylight room, but it looks mostly like other TVs with all the light pollution in a room. Turn off the lights and draw the curtains for an ultimate cinematic experience. Pair this TV with a quality home audio system (towers, discrete ATMOS, and receiver, not a sound bar) and you'll have yourself a \"better than IMAX\" experience in you own living room. Or just use the TV and you'll have at least have better picture than any, yes any, movie theater. I have watched many movies now and with each one i am floored at the quality of the image. Crystal clear, bright, accurate colors, every hair on the head is clear, complete and perfect black. Only thing that can be difficult is when watching movies with bright flashes during dark scenes (like Wonder Woman fighting Ares) is it goes from ultra dark to ultra bright. It makes it like you are really there in the fight, but it can be quite blinding. I do not lose any of the detail in the dark, the blacks and the dark grays blend naturally and still allow for the clarity as it is in real life. The only issue is that if you have a bad source, such as online streaming (which is compressed, even if its still \"4K\") the blacks get crushed. This is not a fault of the TV, but we simply do not have the technology to stream true 4K HDR, and it shows on this TV because it is so good at recreating the signal it is given, it cannot add information stripped away by users who won't buy the disks!", " I've been considering an OLED purchase for years - and now that 4k content is readily available, I finally decided it was time to upgrade. I went with the LG OLED because in every professional rating/test proves LG OLED panels perform above and beyond the competition. I upgraded from a 55\" Panasonic Plasma to the 65\" LG C8. Those of you who are true videophiles know that plasma was a fantastic technology that got a bad rap. Plasma had tremendous, deep blacks, with a great picture. My plasma was a 2012 model, however, and was not 4k capable. I said I'd wait until 4k content was widely available before upgrading. Well, Amazon Prime Video, Netflix, and my Xfinity Cable all offer 4k content - so it was time!\n\nStraight out of the box, you\u2019ll want to disable the \u201csoap opera\u201d settings (TruMotion). For the life of me, I don\u2019t know why TV manufactures are still using this technology. It looks terrible. However, once this feature is disabled, and the rest of the picture tuning is completed, you\u2019ll want to cry because you never knew a TV picture could look so incredible. Seriously, I knew OLED to be awesome, but I did not know it could possibly be THIS awesome. The picture is simply stunning. Goosebumps-stunning.\n\nI keep the OLED panel light set around 25-30 most of the time. At first, it may seem dim, but after a day or two of watching TV, it becomes very natural. The super-bright OLED is not good for your eyes, and it is not good at accurately recreating a picture. In my setup, with dark navy walls behind the TV, when the lights are out, you can't differentiate the wall from the TV - the blacks are simply that \"black\". The content appears to come straight out of the wall. The crisp, natural look is impossible to describe here - just know that you can't find a better picture anywhere. I just can\u2019t get over how amazing the picture looks.\n\nOther findings:\n\n- The Smart features are amazing. I can turn the TV on and off by voice with my Google Home setup. I believe it works the same with Alexa. The TV features a plethora of apps through WebOS (including several you can download for free). It is incredibly easy to cast content from phones, computers, etc.\n- The remote is also awesome - it works like a mouse - so even the built-in web browser is very, very easy to use. I can visit/use any website with ease through the TV. Navigating through menus is also very easy. The remote took a little getting used to, but after using it for a short period of time, it began to feel very natural.\n- I've only heard the built-in speakers a few times since I use a full 5.1 channel home theater setup. They are robust, to say the least, but they can never replicate a full home theater setup.\n\nNot \u201cnegatives\u201d per se, but, considerations:\n- Mounting the TV on the wall was perhaps the most nerve-racking experience of my life. This is a $3,000 TV, yet, the upper 75% of the TV is nearly as thin as a paper, and just about as flexible. To attach the mounts, I had to lay the TV down on the ground flat. The mounts attached easily \u2013 but lifting the TV off the ground was the worst part, because all the weight and structure is in the base of the TV. You simply cannot lift the TV from the top corners, or you'll risk (literally) shattering the panel. They even include a warning about holding/lifting from the top corners. It took a lot of strength to lift it off the ground using the mount arms/bottom of the TV - but once it was upright, it felt very sturdy.\n- I was equally frustrated by the exceptionally short power cable. It is maybe 36\"? Just enough to reach the ground after mounting it on the wall. I had to run an extension cord just to plug it in. For $3,000, it would've been nice to toss in an extra two or three feet of power cable, right?\n- One warning - if you run the pixel wiper (takes an hour or so), beware that the TV will turn itself ON after it is done. So, don't start the wipe and leave for work or go to bed - you may end up with burn in. (Burn in has not happened to me - I am as OCD as it gets when to making sure it is off when I'm not watching it, and not on the same channel w/ scrolling banners, etc.) OLED burn-in is a real thing, though, so just be careful when watching certain content. Gamers and those who only watch cable news channels should probably consider a different technology.\n\nI did elect to purchase the SquareTrade extended warranty. Considering the expense of this TV, I love having that piece of mind for the next four years, should something go wrong.\n\nAll-in-all, I couldn\u2019t be happier. This is the TV I\u2019ve been dreaming of. If you move forward and purchase, you\u2019ll agree!\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Take with a grain of salt those reviewers who rate this TV badly because of burn-in. The burn-in is almost always caused by lack of awareness and/or carelessness by the reviewer; if the TV is left on a static image/channel for way too long, it\u2019s going to burn in (as any TV can do \u2013 plasma, LED, and OLED). That is not the fault of the manufacture; that is the fault of the user.", "Good:\nThe best picture quality on a TV today\n\nBad:\nAfter one week, the screen developed a bright blue pixel that would not shut off. It was like having a bright blue LED in the image at all times. This is referred to as a \"stuck\" pixel (not a dead or black) pixel and is covered by warranty. I knew I could rely on Amazon's excellent customer support to replace the TV, however I wanted to see what LG would do first. I created a repair ticket on LG's website and was called by a support agent two days later. They promised that someone would call to arrange an onsite inspection within 48 hours. Three days later, no one had called and I checked the Repair Ticket status on LG's website; they had cancelled the repair!\n\nThe online explanation was that it was a \"duplicate ticket\". It was not. I spent hours on the phone with LG and when they looked into the matter, they said that the service company cancelled the repair because a \"technician was not available\". I asked them \"How is that possible? How is it that you unilaterally canceled my repair without a) notifying me and b) rescheduling a repair if a technician is not available?\" They said they did not know.\n\nLG created a second repair ticket. A very nice third-party technician came to my home a few days later. He took pictures of the problem and called LG Technician Support. They asked him to open and take apart this brand new $3,000 TV. Please note that there is nothing repairable in the screen. A stuck pixel is a microscopic transistor that is fused ON and cannot be changed, or repaired in isolation. The technician, to his credit, said that the entire TV should just be replaced, but LG insisted that he order a replacement 65\" OLED panel which would take several weeks to arrive and then take this entire TV apart and replace the panel. I said \"Thank you very much, but please cancel the repair\". LG's support is literally the worst that I have come across and is so bad that I will think twice before buying any other products from them.\n\nAfter the technician left, I called Amazon and they were great. Two days later Amazon dropped off a brand new LG 65\" OLED TV and picked up the defective one, all at no cost vs waiting weeks for LG grinding through a lousy repair process.\n\nMeh: The TV's sound. Poor sound quality and poor dialog intelligibility as is usual from built-in speakers. I expected this before I ordered so I bought an LG SK9Y soundbar together with the TV. The soundbar is really quite good and produces very clear dialog, reasonable mid-range and there is an acceptable separate wireless sub-woofer. Actually better than expected. A soundbar was sufficient for this location's use, but it is definitely not comparable to a proper surround sound system for a home theater type installation.\n\nGood to know / caveats\nThe picture quality as shipped is not what was expected, quite dull. A bit of searching on the internet revealed that the energy savings mode was the culprit. Turning off or lowering the energy savings mode will completely change the quality of the picture from dull and lifeless to bright and vibrant. You should definitely turn it off before any screen calibration attempt. I am not a fan of fluorescent, unrealistically saturated colors and this LG can definitely be set up to give you the best picture quality available today. By way of comparison, we also have three Panasonic Viera Plasma TVs which for me was always the standard to beat in picture quality. This LG OLED is the first TV I have seen that has a better picture than the Panasonic plasma. When the OLED kicks in to HDR mode with the right content, it is like looking through a window rather than watching a screen.\n\nAnother caveat is that LG just announced at CES January 2019 that their new 2019 TVs will have Apple Airplay 2 capability but that it will NOT be available to existing 2018 TV owners. What a horrible thing to hear two weeks after buying a $3,000 TV !! That is just incredibly terrible and alienating as far as customer brand allegiance goes. Sony and others who sell TVs based on LG's OLED panels have already publicly committed to supporting Airplay 2 upgrades for their recent TVs via firmware upgrade.\n\nThe final caveat relates to LG's Privacy and Terms and Conditions. It turns out that you actually can't use certain functions of the TV unless you agree to their EGREGIOUS Privacy policy which virtually forces you to comply with their right to collect information about you and what you watch for data mining and marketing purposes which can include third parties. This just further taints LG as a heavy-handed, old-world mentality company. A customer should feel great when making a purchase of this magnitude. It is made to bring pleasure into one's home, not to have the experience negatively compromised by forced compliance with unwanted Terms and Conditions.", "I'm writing this to help those of you with high quality plasma sets (Pioneer Kuro, hi end Panasonics) who have been waiting to \"upgrade\" to either an OLED or perhaps Samsung QLED. I have 3 Kuro sets, two of them are in the 40 inch range and our main set was the Pro-151FD with a 60 inch screen. They have all been trouble free with gorgeous picture quality. The reviews at the time were universal in calling the Pioneer Kuro the best TV ever made. I never liked LCD images, they seemed excessively bright and contrasty, looking more cartoonish than cinematic. So when the 2018 LG 77 inch OLED (C8PUA) dropped in price I made the plunge. I expected the larger size and great picture quality to be a step up from the plasma. I had been to retail stores but they manipulate the images that you see such that they are not representative of what you'll see at home. I based my decision on reviews mostly; the 2018 LG OLED was \"TV of the year\" for many reviewers so I figured it had to be a good TV. Better than a hi end plasma?\nFirstly, if you bought a high end plasma you appreciate and require quality. You will be stunned at what has happened, at least with LG in regards to manufacturing quality. The 60 inch Kuro weighs 120 pounds and of course there was never a concern with burn in or reliability, both worries with OLED technology. The 77 inch LG OLED weighs 80 pounds. Of course there is the very thin screen, but I don't consider that a plus. It makes the thing very difficult to pick up or hang from the wall because you can only really handle it from the bottom. The LG remote is cheap plastic and gimmicky, compared to the Pioneer (photo) and maybe the owners manual tells it all (photo). Pioneer went to the trouble to detail EVERYTHING you need to know (165 pages, quality glossy paper) whereas LG printed out a pitiful little excuse for a manual on 18 pages of the cheapest paper they could find. It is useless, they actually refer to stabilizing the back of the TV using wire and eye bolts, like a picture frame. Seriously? There is NOTHING about picture settings or dozens of other items so I called LG and said I must have not been sent the actual owners manual. Long story short they will send you a link to download the exact same \"manual\" and a users guide that just sends you to a website where the typos and general nonsense let you know it was composed by a non English speaking person.\nSecondly, a couple facts that should have influenced me more, but I ignored them. 1080 images are very similar in quality to 4K, in fact they are indistinguishable in sets 65 inches and under. I had hoped that by getting a larger screen I would appreciate the greater pixel density, ignoring the fact that the larger the screen size the lower the quality of the image. There are just so many pixels, and the more area they are spread over the less clear will be the image. And most importantly, how much 4K material will you actually watch? Cable broadcasts and streaming services vary from 720 to 1080 with very few exceptions. You really have to buy a 4K DVD player and watch native 4K blu ray DVDs to appreciate any difference in image quality IMO. The \"upscaling\" you hear about is not noticeable, at least in my experience with the Kuro vs the LG OLED. So in my case the 60 inch Kuro has equal or better image quality compared to the 77 inch OLED 99% of the time (I watch a few 4K YouTube videos). I have not spent money on a 4K DVD player as the world seems to be going to streaming.\nThirdly, all of the newer TVs, including the LG OLED, are \"smart\" TVs, meaning that they are monitoring your every watching moment to glean your preferences so that marketing people can customize their advertising just for you. The default setting on this LG OLED was to monitor my viewing and share it with \"others\". I had to search the net to find out how to turn it off. You can of course keep the set off the internet but that eliminates the use of streaming services and automatic software updates. It's the world we live in but in this regards the plasmas are so much better. You can always stream through a myriad of other devices and leave the TV to be a TV and not a spy.\nConclusion: If I were to do it again I'd keep the 60 inch Kuro, pocket the $6500 I spent on the LG, and wait for microLED or some other technology that offers a genuine upgrade. I'd also look harder at Sony as their quality may be better than LG.", "This TV has a wonderful picture and plays videos stored on External USB Hard Drives (preferably the portable type)!\n\nNo \"STAR\" rating for gaming since I don't do games.\n\nWhen I first got this TV very little valid information seemed to be available - most of it outdated. I think the info I internet-found a year ago applied to drives with FAT32 file system, or NTFS initialized with the MBR partition style, which claimed to limit videos to 4 Gb and/or Drives to 2 Tb.\n\nSo here is what I have learned 1 year later. You do not have to have a drive with it's own power supply to hook an External USB drive up to this TV. It has worked well with both Toshiba Canvio Basics 2 Tb and Western Digital Passport Ultra 5 Tb hard drives as follows.\n\nThe following file systems work with this TV for external/portable (USB) hard drives: NTFS (and maybe FAT32 but I haven't tried it). The disk drive will need to have been initialized using the GPT style to have a larger than 2 Tb NTFS partition. (Added Mar. 22, 2021: The drives typically sold today (if not noted to be Apple-formatted) are sold already formatted and partitioned correctly (NTFS/GPT) for storing large videos (> 4GB) for smart TVs - at least those I'm familiar with - and also are accessible with Windows PCs.)\n\n(GPT) NTFS has a maximum disk size of 256 Tb and maximum filesize of 256 Tb (1 large file could fill the disk). So videos stored on a GPT-Initialized NTFS-formatted disk can be larger than 4 Gb and the disk can be larger than 2 Tb. I have a 5 Tb Western Digital My Passport Ultra formatted to NTFS with a single (about) 5 Tb GPT partition that connects and plays videos videos > 20GB fine. I find I have to wait 10 to 20 seconds after turning the TV on for the Passport disk to fully come up (my 2 Tb drives don't have that wait) but it seems to access the drive fine and prepared to accept at least up to 5 Tb of storage.\n\nFile System Compatibility: I converted one Passport drive to ExFAT to use on an Ipad Pro. ExFAT won't work on this TV and neither did APFS Apple's file system format, but Apple requires ExFAT, Fat32, or APFS, and my Windows PC can do NTFS or ExFAT. There is also a FAT file system, but I have not researched it.\n\nSo my TV can talk through drives with my Windows PC, and my Windows PC can talk to my Ipad Pro (which can also play videos on USB drives), but my Ipad Pro cannot talk to my TV - unless they're all speaking Fat32 which Windows 10 currently offers only for maximum 32 Gb drives.\n\nUpdate 2021-03-22 - If you want to get a hard drive for use with this TV I suggest a \"Portable Hard Drive\". These drives have a low enough power consumption that they can be driven by the power provided through a USB cable and do not come with a power converter. Else you'll be buying an \"External Hard Drive\" that requires a power converter that must plugged into a power supply. Other users recommend that a maximum 5TB portable drive can be powered through a USB cable and report troubles with 8TB Portable Drives.", "First, the picture quality is fantastic, the unit looks great, is light weight, and has some great features. I would love to give this set 5 stars but there are things to me that make this tv just better than average. The first is the HDMI ARC. I have the HDMI ARC connected to a new JBL Bar 5.1 soundbar. I have a Roku and Blu-Ray disc player connected to the sound bar. The problem is that sometimes the TV fails to recognize the inputs on the sound bar (Roku won't show up under the list of inputs for the HDMI ARC). Sometimes I will select the Roku input and the tv will go to to the Blu-Ray and turn it on. Very frustrating. I believe part of the problem is how the HDMI ARC standard has been implemented. In a nutshell, I do not believe the problem would exists if I had an LG sound bar connected. Just my opinion. Now to correct this, I was going to abandon using the HDMI ARC and connect the sound bar using the supplied digital optical cable and then connect the Roku and BD directly to the other HDMI ports. My problem is that my TV is already mounted to the wall and I can not pull the protective cap off the optical digital audio output to insert the optical cable. I can reach it, but, LG uses a cap that is flush and not the kind that protrude so you can easily grab and pull out. Needless to say, I have to remove the TV from the wall to change the set up. Another problem is the internal streaming tuner. I get a better connection going through Roku than the internal streaming tuner. I have found this true with every TV I have/had. The Roku tuner is superior to TV internal streaming tuners. In regards to the tv's OTA tuner, I use to feed OTA signals to my old tv using a Tivo receiver. With this set, I have the outside antenna going directly to the LG set. I use to pick up more OTA stations before. I would have to say that the Tivo tuner was better that the LG OTA tuner. LG doesn't seem to believe in documentation. What they do have is not all that helpful. I downloaded the documentation from the LG website. So, if this is the latest and greatest in tv technology I am not impressed. Granted, the picture quality is the best I ever had, I find the \"smart\" features lacking. Some of my older technology out performs what this tv offers (including little plastic protective caps that you can easily be put in and out of optical ports). As it stands , I probably would not buy another LG tv.", "I've been eyeballing this TV for over a year now, but finally caught a break on the price and gave in. Originally, I was torn on which TV to get. For those of you researching OLED vs QLED, there are a lot of videos and reviews that explain in more technical terms which TV will work best for your needs. I don't game on my TV and just watch movies/4K content, so it was an easy pick for me.\n\nThe picture quality on this 65 inch C8 model is amazing! If you have seen one of these models in store, I don't need to explain that the picture is crisp and clear. Default settings for picture and audio are good, but everyone should adjust to their needs (brightness, contrast, sound, etc). I ended up turning off the TruMotion (which makes it look fake) and enabling all of the Dolby features since i paired this TV with a 4K Apple TV and LG soundbar. The three together support Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision, so when 4K movies/content show up, they are beautiful! Also a nice feature is that when i turn on/off the TV, the sound bar and Apple TV also turn on/off.\n\nLG's TV features are also quick and functional. I've never had an LG TV before, but it is fairly easy and intuitive to learn. They have a pointer built into the remote that helps you select options like a mouse on your computer. The menu overlays are not bulky or cumbersome and you can adjust settings during a movie or show. This includes changing the picture mode (cinema, standard) or just picture settings. Also, LG has its own browser and apps built in for major companies like Netflix, Amazon, etc. Again, I have the Apple TV with the same features so I don't use them on the TV itself. Coming from a 55 inch Vizio, this TV wins hands down in terms of responsiveness, features, picture quality and reputation. One word to the wise, the 65inch is very heavy. You will need two people to set this up without bending, breaking or dropping the TV.\n\nLastly and my only \"con\" is not with the TV, but the shipping service used. My particular deal was not a prime offer, so it was shipped using a company called Pilot. It took 2.5 weeks for the TV to arrive with constant delivery date changes and having to take time off of work to receive it. I even called the company to see if needed to come home from work to accept it and the guy told me it will be there between 9-5. By far my worst delivery experience (not awful though), just keep in mind which company is shipping when you buy. If I had a choice, I would never use Pilot as they are slow as molasses and my TV sat in a warehouse for over a week until they could deliver it! Anyways, enjoy this TV it is worth it!", "VERY pricey, but WELL worth the money if you can afford it. Twelve years ago when Consumer Reports said Panasonic's Viera plasma TV had the best picture of any TV they ever reviewed, I immediately bought one, a 58-inch model. They were right and it's still a great TV, but not so big anymore. I yearned for an 80-inch screen. So I went back to Consumer Reports and found this TV is their highest rated TV today. Unfortunately, LG's largest screen in this model is \"only\" 77 inches. But Consumer Reports was right before, so I sprung for this expensive toy.\n\nThey were right again. This picture blows away my old plasma, which still has an astounding picture. Deepest blacks and most vivid colors I have ever seen on a TV. And the SIZE...need I really say anything about size? This thing is a MONSTER! My sectional sits 12 feet away. It's an immersive experience, especially with surround sound. And the technology itself is nothing less than IMPRESSIVE! Seriously, the screen is no wider than a thick piece of glass and looks just like a thick piece of glass. I held an old lead pencil up to it and the TV screen was no thicker than the pencil!\n\nBut as much as I love this TV, I must say, the internal owner manual (the ONLY owner manual) is really, really bad! Plugged in out of the box, the contrast was far too dark and color saturation far too intense. After much frustration with the stupid \"manual\" which tells you what different functions control (but not how to ADJUST those controls!), I gave up and spent half a day experimenting. It took me half a day to find picture controls despite the fact that I'm fairly computer savvy and often go right into unknown programs and make them work by intuition. But this TV's controls are not intuitive. They are stupid and unexplained. And don't get me started on the idiotic \"smart remote\" with the floating cursor you can't get rid of.\n\nBut still...once you figure out how to adjust your TV and pair your satellite or cable remote to operate your TV (so you don't have to deal with the dumb floating cursor that relentlessly keeps coming back on when you use the TV remote), this TV's picture cannot be beaten. You have to pay dearly for the latest and best technology, like I did 12 years ago, and like I did today. But if you can afford it, you cannot go wrong with this beautiful, wonderful adult toy. After 3 days, I'm still agape in front of my new TV watching and re-watching stuff I hadn't seen in years, just because EVERYTHING looks so GREAT on this TV...naw...this ain't a TV. It's an EXPERIENCE!", "First off , the picture is great . I did a little tweaking of my own to get it where i liked it. However, when fast action happens in a darker scene on the TV it can pixelate or judder to the point where you can't ignore it. My 60inch Plasma TV handles motion better. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.\nSo my Ideal TV would be a cross between the picture on the OLED and the motion handling of my Plasma.\nIn reading reviews before buying this TV I learned that LG made all the OLED screens for their competitors . And that Sony had the same screen as my LG but reviewers said it had a better motion software and did less pixelating.\nI did not get to compare side by side but its something you might want to look into.\nI have Netflix and Amazon Prime that I use for streaming so when LG ask me to jump through some hoops to use their smart apps I passed. So I can't rate the Smart features.\nI had heard of complaints that OLED TVS don't get bright enough. This TV does not have that problem . However glare could be a problem during daylight hours in a well light room.\nThe TV screen is just a piece of glass so it can be a little scary getting it out of the box and putting the stand on. Once that was done and the TV was put in place I was able relax but it is truly scary thin.\nOne more thing. I read where people are concerned about burn in. I know I won't have that problem because I don't keep it on one channel or leave it on when not in the room. I don't think the average user will have that problem with this TV.\nOverall , I like the TV . Since I got a great deal on it, I am able to overlook some of its short comings. If I had paid full price I might think different.", "I did a lot of research before buying a TV, and picked this one to replace my aging 1080p set. (I should note that my old TV cost something like $6,000, so it was extremely nice, but it was also 1080p and more than 10 years old.)\n\nThis LG model has worked beautifully. With some minor picture adjustments (look it up\u2014basically turn off the motion smoothing and the rest of it is great right out of the box), it looked fantastic and has performed well from day 1. I also appreciated its ability to pass audio back to my receiver over HDMI, which works reliably even when changing inputs. This means I don't have to touch the receiver when I change inputs, which I used to have to do. Fewer remotes? Total win.\n\nThe HDR features work great attached to an Apple TV 4K, and I have been blown away by the picture quality. Especially when playing back older content (I still watch a lot of standard definition video, on DVDs and stuff), the set looks terrific and the viewing angle for all content is kind of amazing\u2014you can sit off the side and not see any color/brightness shift. This makes it the ideal set for a viewing party.\n\nIf you're ever worried about OLED burn-in, check out the built-in pixel refresher. Basically it does a one-hour-ish cleaning cycle after you activate it (which turns the TV off, and the TV must remain off until it's done\u2014or you have to do it over again). I use subtitles on almost all programming (so hard black/white in the same bottom region of the screen) and have not seen any burn-in in months of heavy use. I ran the refresher once just to see what it would do. I couldn't tell the difference, but it...felt nice to have that option I guess?\n\nI don't use the smart features at all, so I can't comment on them. I can say the WebOS interface seems fine for getting at the settings and stuff.\n\nThe one negative I can say about this is the red pointer that shows up when you use the remote. My cat thinks it's a laser toy and runs straight for the TV, trying to catch the red dot. So...yeah, just be careful about that one. We try to turn the set on and off using a different remote, and only use the actual TV's remote when we absolutely have to, because that cat is a monster.", "I've had my TV for 3 days and have been awed by the picture. Last night's NFL game looked like it was being played in my living room! That's the good news.\n\nThe bad news is that LG documentation is really, really bad. I write technical documents for a living and the LG stuff is useless. Equally bad is the ALEXA configuration/connection/support. I have had ALEXA for some time. All of my lights (Philips Hue) are configured as is my SONOS system. Both were easily recognized once I enabled the corresponding ALEXA skill. They both have excellent stand alone iPhon/iPad apps as well.\n\nThere are 3 LG ThinQ skills. The LG ALEXA instructions leave it up to you to pick. There are also 2 LG apps that you need to decide between. If you figure these things out, you are informed that any existing LG user ID/password, that you may have in association with other LG products, will not work and that you need to create a new one via the LG SmartThinQ phone app. Even if you do this bit you may well be out of luck. I spent 45 minutes on the phone with Level 1 LG support and another 20 with Level 2. After an hour on the phone the blamed it on Amazon and told me to call them. I did, and spend another 30 minutes on the phone with Amazon support. It still doesn't work. So if you're buying this TV to work with ALEXA, be afraid, be very afraid.\n\nAnd now on to the \"Magic\" remote. The magic ends if you have a SONOS sound bar connected via optical cable. If you do have a SONOS sound bar connected via optical cable the Magic remote does not work. You cannot control the volume on the TV with the Tragic Remote. I suppose that it's understandable that LG would omit support for SONOS as they only have 14% of the domestic sound bar market.\n\nSo while I am thrilled with the picture quality of the TV, I am hugely disappointed in the performance, documentation and support for all of the other advertised features of this expensive TV.", "I am comparing this t.v. to my 10 year old Panasonic plasma 720p. This t.v. is a very good t.v. I've received complements regarding it. However, time marches on and we now have 4K available. I can see detail like never before and that includes SD videos being up scaled. The color and brightness are more than adequate.I would say breathtaking.\n\nThe reason for the 1/2 star \"hit\" is due to a couple of things. First and foremost is the reflection. It's an irritating distraction that you have to overlook. I don't have a bright room at all but light coming from the windows, for example, is very noticeable. In a dark room I don't see how you could want for a better t.v. viewing experience. There are a couple of other factors, like \"Am I supposed to get a manual?\". I didn't get any detailed manual with mine. The remote takes a little getting used to which you will find yourself reaching for all the time. You have to change the picture according to the dynamics used when it was filmed. One movie might look excellent in Cinema, another in Standard.\n\nAll in all I'm glad I got it because the quality of the video is greatly improved.", "I have had this TV for more than 2 yrs now. No issues so far good sound and pic quality. are A+, very handsome look. Recommend.", "I have a 2017 LG OLED 55\" and love the picture quality. It is in a mostly dark room so the colors on last years model really popped where I placed it and calibrated it. the negative thing I did not like was that sometimes you could see pixelation. The amazon video app load screen is the perfect example. it's not a big deal at all. The reason why I'm saying this is because the 2018 model doesn't have that issue. The picture is even better on the 2018. I can't believe it was possible to make a great screen even better. I have my new one on the wall and in a room that gets a moderate amount of sunlight. in the day time it does look a little dim. I will say that all the comparison videos of LG OLED vs Samsung's top of the line QLED is accurate about the LG OLED brightness. this TV is NOT for bright rooms. I would probably say that a moderately bright room will challenge this TV's brightness. I have to close the blinds to cut out the sun light and my TV is AMAZING! I don't think it's a big deal to get up and close blinds if I want a great picture but I do want to warn you that the reviews on the web about this TV's brightness is very accurate.\n\nFrom a gaming perspective this feels like the same TV as last years. the picture quality is the same and even in my moderately bright room I can play video games without having to close my blinds. It's only movies that are the issue. playing games on my Xbox there are no issues with brightness playing any FPS or Overwatch. I think Sea of Thieves may be a little tough to see in a bright room but I don't play that game.\n\nMore to come... this is my first month review", "The TV is as advertise. The picture is spectacular and just as OLED supposed to be. This is really not the TV that I wanted to buy and it was not because I didn't like OLED it was only because of the burning issues that plaquing this technologic and I wanted to get the Samsung QLED F9 because of that burning problem and the samsung been more futured proof but the Samsung was at a price that only rich people can buy at more than $3000 smackers and I decided to go with this OLED IG C8 and I bought it for just over $2.100. I took the chance because I believe that I'm a careful enough person to avoid burning and I guess we gonna have to wait and see if my gamble will paid off in the long run. The seller was very nice and the only problem I had was with AM trucking the delivery company that Digital Supplies use is a little in responsible I didn't have an elevators where I live but it was only a 3rd floor and this lacy creeps didn't wanted to go that short distance so I needed help from a neighbor with the TV.", "I just got the TV and got a great deal on Amazon Prime lightning deal after my old Samsung LCD showed vertical lines on the screen. Compared to the old Samsung LCD TV this replaced the OLED picture is amazing.\nSome things I miss from the Samsung: No component in, no analog audio out. I bought a digital to audio converter and connected it to the digital audio out. It works great with my receiver.\nThe sound in standard mode is a few decibels lower than my old TVs. I am still experimenting with the sound settings to get the optimal sound.\nBuyer beware: UPS had a problem with the delivery. I got an email from Amazon that the TV was damaged. UPS said there was no damage-just the box was too heavy for 1 person to deliver. Instead of helping resolve the delivery issue, Amazon help desk attempted to recall the delivery ! Amazon customer service needs a lot of improvement. They still do not know the TV was delivered! Jeff Bezos please note: SERVICE is missing from your customer service.", "I have owned the LG C8 55\" OLED for over a week and I have owned the LG C7 55\" OLED for several months and the differences in performance will only be noticeable if you know what to look for. The much hyped Alpha 9 does genuinely increase performance in certain areas but is it enough? The C8 colors are a little more brighter in HDR formats and the displayed images show some improvement. The C8 displays the best contrasts I have ever seen. The colors really pop, especially in dark or night scenes. It is also easier/faster to navigate between apps on the C8 than on the C7. Thanks to black frame insertion, motion interpolation is better on the C8. The C8 allows motion interpolation control in \"Game\" mode (Motion Pro), which is also an improvement over the C7. As far as image retention on the C8, it has not a problem for me. There is a \"pixel refresher\" and a new \"Logo Luminescence Adjustment\" feature to control IR on the C8 but I have never had to use it.\n\nOverall, the C8 is a better OLED TV, however, it feels like a tweaked C7 given that most of the features like pixel orientation, HDMI inputs, input lag, WiFi, apps, etc. all run about the same. I would recommend the C8 over the C7 if performance improvement is important to the consumer, although you may want to wait a few months until the price goes down.", "Watching 4K programming on this TV is nothing short of jaw dropping. When it comes to watching normal high definition (1080p) programming, it\u2019s about average. My eight-year-old plasma TV had a better normal high definition picture. However, I bought this TV to watch 4K programming on Netflix and Amazon fire TV and it\u2019s absolutely stunning. I keep saying to myself \u201cI can\u2019t believe what I\u2019m seeing!\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to Alexa integration, it\u2019s extremely limited. Alexa will turn off the TV but won\u2019t turn it on. As long you\u2019re saying \u201cask LG\u201d before every command. Changing channels is very hit or miss. Sometimes it will do it sometimes it won\u2019t. Actually most of the time it won\u2019t. Alexa will tell you to use the TVs remote to change the channel. But sometimes in the process of doing that it will actually change the channel. But for the most part, Alexa is useless for doing anything but turning off the TV.\n\nSo the bottom line is, if you want to watch 4K programming on a regular basis get this TV it can\u2019t be beat. If you plan to mostly watch normal 1080 P programming Stick with what you\u2019ve got or try and find a plasma TV. They\u2019re still the best for normal HD.", "The TV arrived quickly but I had some concerns when the delivery person wheeled it in to my house upside down. I asked him to let me open it to check it but he said no and grumbled when I asked him to turn it upright. I don't know if the choice of delivery is up to the seller or Amazon but I was pretty displeased with the person who showed up.\n\n10 minutes later he was gone and I turned the TV on to discover a highly visible black line across the entire screen right on the setup screen. The glass wasn't cracked or damaged at all so I'm guessing it was either a manufacturing error or some kind of internal damage. I tried using some of the software features to try to \"refresh\" the LEDs but that didn't solve anything. I then used a magnifying glass and the LEDs weren't even on.\n\nOtherwise, the TV itself was gorgeous and I look forward to replacing it ASAP. The picture was incredible. The UI took a bit to get used to, especially with the motion controller, but I will probably end up replacing the remote for one with a keyboard. It connected to my network and updated quickly. There are several layers of requests to capture and record your smart function usage. Adding apps and signing in to N****x, Y*****e, and Amazon Prime was intuitive. After about an hour of testing functions and different sources and inputs to see if the problem hopefully self-corrected (it didn't) it was simple to factory reset and remove all of my accounts.\n\nThe box it came in was very sturdy and the styrofoam was easy to puzzle back together if you took everything out carefully. In retrospect, I was glad I was so careful, because I hadn't planned on having to deal with returns.\n\nThe hardest part was the return because I didn't get an option to have it picked up and had to wait several days to borrow a vehicle large enough to take the TV to the UPS store. It's been 5 days and so far the return hasn't been processed even though the tracking number confirmed it was shipped and received the very next morning. Again I'm not sure if this is a problem with Amazon or the seller.", "Tl;dr Amazing picture once it is calibrated, but be sure to run audio to a receiver.\n\nOut of the box the brights are blinding and the \"soap opera effect\" is nauseating, but those are easily addressed with some quick customizations under the Picture settings. Several sites have detailed walkthroughs and then you can adjust further from there.\n\nOnce calibrated, the display is absolutely stunning.

This is my 3rd kid, and 3rd carseat. This cover is a dream compared to some other ones.\n\n\u2022 Easy to wash.\n\n\u2022 Lightweight\n\n\u2022 Compact\n\n\u2022Extendable handle on stroller\n\nThe Cons:\n\u2022 Stroller not easy to figure out the first time. Hear me out. I used this to take my son to the doctor, I didn\u2019t assemble it, read directions, or even look at a picture... my husband gave me the run down, and I figured it was a stroller - how hard could it be!? That was a mistake.\n\nWhen I unfolded the stroller and attached the adapters to accept the carseat, I had no idea there was a left or right. I put the adapters in, which can go in wrong - fyi, and struggled for several minutes to line up the carseat, with my son in it. Imagine balancing a super heavy plate on two chopsticks! That\u2019s what sliding the carseat in to the adapters is like.\n\nAfter trying and failing so many times to attach the carseat to the stroller, to the point I was almost late to the doctor appointment, I called my husband. He couldn\u2019t figure it out. FINALLY, after several more minutes, a facetime, and running out of ideas I realized the adapters could be inserted backwards, and that was the issue. I popped them out, flipped them around and in 10 second the carseat was attached to the stroller- by that point I was a pro. It\u2019s a miracle I didn\u2019t drop the carseat trying to do this!\n\n\u2022 Carseat removal from the stroller is awkward! Relieved that I had the carseat on the stroller, I hurried to my appointment for the baby. We were taken back to the room and we were asked to leave the stroller in the hallway. I thought no big deal, just use the same handle to remove the carseat from the base and... *click, click, click* the carseat was not coming off of the stroller. The nurse who sees babies and strollers all day, and who is a mom, pointed to the carseat removal handle and said \u201cShouldn\u2019t this remove the carseat from the stroller?\u201d and pointed to the lever on the back of the carseat. You\u2019d think so, but no.\n\nShe made room and I wheeled him into the exam room.\n\nUpon returning to my small suv, I knew I would need to get the carseat off the stroller. Mind you, it\u2019s May in California and it\u2019s hot! It\u2019s COVID so I\u2019m wearing a mask, I\u2019ve struggled with this stroller at every turn. After a peek around, I saw two small levers on the front of the carseat and wouldn\u2019t you know those are the stroller release! Pushing the levers is easy. The awkward part is trying to push the levers and at the same time lift and rotate to remove the carseat. It\u2019s especially annoying if your sweet baby is asleep.\n\n\u2022 The way the stroller folds is prone to tear up the foam handle if it is extended. You have to return the handle flush to the stroller to avoid this before you fold it up.\n\n\u2022 The basinet part of the stroller is a great cat bed. I think we used it once! Babies fall asleep quickly in the car usually, so the likelihood you\u2019re going to transfer a sleeping baby to a basinet is slim to none. Also there is no good way to cover the basinet with a blanket (a baby face mask if you will,) so another reason we didn\u2019t use it.\n\n\u2022The carseat is heavy. Our main living space is upstairs so I have to haul our baby in the carseat up and down stairs. I\u2019ve also had a Chicco, and Graco and the Maxi Cosi carseat is beefy! It feels sturdy and has good safety reviews so we deal with it.\n\n\u2022 Not enough room with adjusting the straps. My son was 21-3/4\u201d when he was born. We\u2019ve had him at the second crotch strap placement (furthest away from the baby,) and tallest back straps since the time he was about 3 months. He\u2019s now 7 months and his shoulders are too wide to fit comfortably in this carseat. We\u2019re searching for a replacement.\n\nEssentially, this is an expensive mistake. I have purchased a decent umbrella stroller since buying this travel system and my son likes it, it\u2019s easier to use, and folds smaller. Every kid is different, but my son likes to sit up.\n\nI REALLY wanted to like this whole set up, but I feel more like I put up with it. I would do things differently if I could go back and try again.", "I cannot thank them enough. A crazy neighbor took two of our wheels in retaliation for complaining about the noise. When I told the company, they shipped us the wheels with no questions asked. For free! I could not believe a large company would be so understanding and helpful.\n\nAs for the excellent stroller, it is extremely easy to use. The frame is light and it is easy to adjust. Our baby has grown fast and we have already had to move the straps, but this was so easy to figure out. The stroller also balances well and lends itself well to moving our daughter from the car to her stroller in less than a few seconds. I would recommend anyone to purchase this again.", "I have been reading a lot of mixed reviews over this stroller all over the web. So I was really worried when I received my stroller today. But It was very easy to assemble, I hardly read the instructions because it was that easy. But that\u2019s if you\u2019re good in building things and I am. The negative reviews I read were about the cupholder and about how hot the baby may get because of the material of the car seat . I do agree, that the cupholder does look cheap, and it keeps falling off. The other thing is the cloth of the car seat I do see why people have said that the baby gets hot. It\u2019s not summer here so I\u2019m not sure how my baby is going to feel about the material when it\u2019s hot outside. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be an issue though . The stroller is on the wider side at the bottom, it\u2019s a lot of room for storage but I wish it was a little bit more narrow for me. I\u2019ve also read that the stroller looks cheap but it doesn\u2019t look cheap or feel cheap. The only thing that feels cheap is the cupholder. I\u2019ve also read that you need Two people to fold the stroller and put the car seat and take it off. But I did it all myself so I\u2019m not sure what these people are doing wrong. It\u2019s easy and I could assure you you only need one person to do the job. Besides that overall the stroller is and looks really good. I will add more to my review once I use it but so far so good", "The only reason why i am giving this travel system a 4-star review is due to 2-reasons. 1. When trying to place the car seat into the stroller, it\u2019s a pain. You have to align it correctly or you can drop the car seat. Removing it is also a challenge. 2. The base of the car seat seems flimsy. With my first child, i purchased a Chicco Bravo and LOVED it! This time, not going to lie, i went off of the looks. Slightly regret it but i chose the aesthetics over the safety of my child. I will continue to use this travel system, in hopes that it will sway me different in time.\n\nDecember 2020 UPDATE:\n\nMy son is now a 1 year old. I want to give this travel system a 1-star. The foam handle is falling apart and we barely used it.(COVID-19 has restricted us from full potential) I\u2019ve been on the edge of just spending the extra $200-$400 for Chicco since this one felt so cheap. WASTE OF MONEY.", "We have a newborn girl, and were invited to test the Maxi-Cosi Zelia Modular Travel System. When the unit arrived at our home, in spite of the box being a little crushed in the corner, everything was fine on the inside. I unpacked all of the pieces and this system took only 4 minutes to assemble. For me,and the older car I installed the base in, clicking in the secure straps actually took longer because I have difficulty snapping these in. Once assembled, my wife, who is about 4'-11\", immediately appreciated how light this system was, especially with folding up and placing the stroller in the back of our car. This system probably weighs 10 lbs less than the Britax system we were recycling that we purchased 5 yrs. ago. Due to the lightness, we immediately questioned the quality, however after using the system for the past 3 weeks, and putting it to the test on long walks through the park, the mall, and the grocery store, we give it 4 out of 5 stars. We plan to do a follow up to this review in about 6 months after we've used it longer. One other note, our daughter seemed to be quite comfortable in the car seat, it is a rather plush and softly cushioned interior. We haven't had any spills in the bassinet on stroller nor in the carseat, but we do question how easily spills can be cleaned from the fabric.... more later.", "I got the most use out of the infant seat, I didn\u2019t really use the stroller much. The few times I used the stroller was when my baby was new- within the first month. Because I can lay the bassinet flat and strap her in that way which worked best since she couldn\u2019t support herself. I am disappointed in the infant seat though. I have only machine washed it one time and I pilled right away after that.", "I\u2019m very disappointed in the product. I have 5 kids including my 2 month old baby. Never had a problem with a car seat with my other kids. Man but the car seat it\u2019s so uncomfortable, the other day we went shopping and put my baby in the car seat. Which I always have trouble putting him in a comfortable spot where he doesn\u2019t slide down. So all of a sudden he started to choke on his own saliva which scared us so much that we that he had something on his throat. But it was caused by the car seat the way is made. It has a big hole where a baby needs to lay down and an angle where that doesn\u2019t happen. But unfortunately this car seat is bad I paid a lot of money for a thing that made my baby choke on his own saliva. Note I didn\u2019t have this problem with my other kids. I would like my refund back and i would like for the seller to pay for shipping. For what it\u2019s product made us go through and still is. I need the refund so I can buy him another stroller and car seat. By the way the stroller goes in one direction when you want to go the other. In general everything is bad. The only part I like that is very compact but other than that it is bad manufactured. I would really appreciate my refund back.", "We bought this for our fourth child. Its been long time since we have had a baby in house so it almost feels like we are first time parents again. She only weighs 6 pounds and we are able to adjust the carseat to fit her comfortably without having to add any thing to it.. Its extremely lightweight. Stylish have gotten many compliments on it. Easy to swap from bassinet to carseat. Stroller folds easily. It's easy to push just glides on floor. The only thing I would change on it is to be able to leave bassinet in place and have ability to snap on carseat without having to remove bassinet.", "I purchased this product and tested it as a member of My-Take. I found this travel system to be super easy to assemble and was able to assemble it within 15 minutes, by myself and without any tools.\n\nAll the pieces were lightweight, yet they are very durable. My favorite aspects of this system was the ease to stroll, the wheels rotate well, the handlebar is easy to adjust, and it has a smooth ride.\n\nI did love that you can adjust it from a carriage, to a sit-up stroller, and pop the car seat in as well. However, the car seat requires an additional 2 \u201clegs\u201d before attaching into the stroller, which i found difficult to remember to bring along.\nOther than that I found it was easy to transport and my little enjoyed strolling around in it.\n\nThe car seat had a super soft material and provided additional supports for baby, especially when they are new and are still gaining head control. I felt super comfortable placing my little in this car seat as it felt very safe.\n\nOverall, I feel this travel system met majority of my needs for me and the babes.", "Love our Maxi Cosi ! Some reviews mention it being hard to turn, we've never experienced such a thing and have been using it for 2 months now with our baby girl who was born in January. Easy to transition the carseat from the car to base and vice versa. The space at the bottom is definitely good for moms who like to pack a few things with them, we have a booking diaper bag (greatest thing) which connects to the stroller handles and leaves the whole bottom free for us to put things we're bringing from home to the car such as grocery bags, detergent coats etc.", "All around I really like this system. I think it looks good in person like the stock photo and it feels sturdy. It has several functions. Like you can lock the front wheels if you don\u2019t want it to move sideways on you while you convert it. It was relatively easy to put together. I didn\u2019t even look at the instructions until after I put it together. But I will say that my system was missing a part. The bumper bar and it\u2019s kind of a pain to get a new one. You can call or text and I\u2019ve called and texted and haven\u2019t heard back yet. I still have it a 5 star because I like it a lot overall.", "this is my first time having a baby & i kid you not, taking him places whether it be in his car seat or in the stroller. everything is so easy and everything hooks so easily. it makes your life go by so much better!! taking your baby anywhere is a lot in general, the carseat/stroller shouldn\u2019t be another hassle also!! i would buy another if i had to", "Love the color and the versatility. Also bassinets and all the different options to use it. The only critique point I have is how to fold it. I used to have a stroller that you could fold single handedly. This one requires you some serious engineering skills. And baby has to wait in car for that. Also, it's a bit bulky in the back so sometimes you get caught in things while driving it because it's a bit bulky. However, it's super easy to drive and high quality. One problem is that the bassinet always wiggles back and forth and it doesn't fit snug in the frame. I read in other reviews that this is the case", "The stroller system looks very nice. It has god quality; however, it is not the most comfortable. The car seat is very very very hot. My baby cryies all the time in the car do to the heat in the back. Evem with the car air conditioning or the central AC of every place in florida. The basket space between the baby basket or the car seat is too narrow. getting your contents in and out of the storage basket is very very uncomfortable. Also, there is only one cup holder which does not allow you to hang anything along the holding bar. You either need two cup holders or something that can help you hold your belongings. Some features are not well thoufh off completely. If you have the car seat in the stroller you need to press both bottons along the sides of the stroller and pull up at the same time to realease the car seat from the stroller. Also, the car seat carrier bar has a button on each side which need to be press at the same time in order to move the bar. Very hard thing to do. The baby basket has a button on each side which need to be pressed at the same time in order to change the basket position from seating to flat sleeping. It is almost impossible for one person to do with the baby in the baby basket. To swich between the baby basket and the car seat you have to place in and out two pieces that need to be detached and carried around to have the availability to swich gears. The weels are very nice, the run very softly.", "First off - I was given the opportunity to test this stroller via a campaign with My-Take. Upon testing this stroller, I found it to be pretty awesome. I like the versatile design, comfortable padding and color (I'm into neutrals). I love the extra large sun canopy - very useful when walking into the sun. The ability to have baby face me or even lay down completely for naps was very nice. It's also great that it comes with the Mico 30 carseat which was very comfortable to carry and easy to install in my car. It was very easy to assemble and it's very easy to fold. The only thing I would say it is missing is a tray at the handle for parents. It does have a cup holder, which is nice, but I would like a small tray to put my phone or keys to make them accessible. That being said, I would still recommend this to anyone looking for a quality travel system with some great features.", "Very easy to fold the chair away and open it but tricky to remove and install the car seat to buggy alone. The wheels tend to catch on small twigs or stones so it can be tricky to manoeuvre but the car seat is great and easy to wash and adjust. The cup holder is the only part of the design I really dislike, it doesn\u2019t clip on sturdily and is easy to lose. Overall quite satisfied with purchase, good value and would definitely buy again, some design tweets would make it solid 5 star.", "Best infant carseat we have ever had. After 3 kids and 7 grandchildren we have had a lot! Plush, comfortable and doesn't make baby sweat like all the others. Isn't super heavy either. We love all the functions of the stroller too. Easy to maneuver. Even grandparent operable! \ud83d\ude06", "It is not easy to maneuver this item. The wheels get stock when you turning around corners. Sometimes , we even had to leave the stroller behind and just use the car seat itself.In the short little time that we've used it, my baby's back is always full of sweat. I don't know how we're going to use this during the summer. Unfortunately, I'm 12 days past my return period.", "I am so happy with this stroller and car seat. I had done a lot of research before getting one, and I am definitely grateful I did. The only problem I see with it is that it is a bit wider than most strollers, and only has one cup holder off to the side. I ended up buying a bag that hooks on to the stroller for my cellphone and other items to be stored in while walking. Otherwise the quality is great, it is a beautiful stroller, easy to take the car seat in and out of holder, and rides smoothly. I am very pleased overall with this product!", "This is a nice looking stroller and car seat combo that is also lightweight. However, the when the car seat and base are installed in my Acura MDX, it hangs significantly over the seat. The last car seat we had did not do this. So I believe the maxi cosi company didn't think about the length of this seat very well when it was designed. Some manufacturers allow 20% of an overhang off of the seat the base is connected too, however that issue needs to be researched and each car evaluated. This was a disappointment."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079ZCMN15", "title": "Cooper Evolution Tour All-Season 175/65R14 82T Tire", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/910TE5NGO5L._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "2,794 ratings", "description": "The Cooper Evolution Tour All-Season Tire is an all-season tire that allows you to tackle the seasons with confidence and gives you the smooth and comfortable ride you depend on.

A lot smoother ride and no noise. Traction in the rain has been great! Hopefully they last for their stated mileage. Will update.\n\nThe installation process through Amazon also went well.", "Worth buying again", "I used to be caught up in always getting a high speed rated tire thinking it was a 'better' tire. Recently a mechanic set me straight and said the rating can be viewed more for comfort than speed, because who drives 130 miles all the time? or even 110.\nThe T rated tires do have a softer wall than the H, and that's a good thing if you're looking for comfort, at the expense of a bit more feel. I think H rated is not bad either.\nSpecific to this tire, it's rated ok in terms of wear (600 or so), and at least the tire shop where I went to have these installed seem to think Cooper is a good brand.\nAnyways if I could get Bridg/Cont even closer to $100 I might have considered, but as it is, this is the best choice.\nConsider the alternative like the W rated Nokian, which are solid tires from Russia, or the Viva line from GY/Walmart. Even those are pricier than these, and after reading the bad reviews for the Viva, I decided to give these a try.\nRambling on... these are fairly quiet, but I thought they would be softer. They are softer than H tires, but just a tad.\nI got these for my daily commute on a Camry - stick shift that I just bought.", "In my Toyota RV4 2017. 131.000 mile\nGood delivery service; I arrive on time. I have 3 years with Cooper Evolution tires, I want to change the front ones; The back ones are still like new.", "Originally had bridgestone ko2's on a mazda cx-3. The ko2s are an aggressive offroad all terrain tire with ultra thick sidewall and make SO much noise. Ordered these because it was the cheapest but also had the best ratings for rain/snow compared to more pricier grand touring tires. There are NOT grand touring but standard touring tires. Tirerack will give you all the information you need but for my usage of highway and light snow use these tires were perfect and ride much more comfortably than the ko2's for obvious reasons.\n\nOne important thing worth mentioning is that these tires arrive EXTREMELY SCUFFED. They almost look used. Im not sure who is at fault here whether its the warehouse or UPS but these tires were scuffed around on all 4 ordered. Packaging was non existent. No ties or plastic or cardboard or anything just a packing sticker attached on the tread. I mean I know im not getting a perfectly packaged item here and the scuff is only cosmetic but dang.. some look pretty bad. Thankfully they werent directional so I had the shop install the lesser scuffed side on the outside face of the rim.\n\nI might try actually ordering through tirerack next time even if its a bit more because they have yet to deliver a scuffed tire to me and at least come with a 2 yr road hazard protection where these do not.\n\nJust to reiterate the scuffs were cosmetic only lightly on the surface, no sidewall damage was evident but unfortunatly tire scuffs cannot be taken off so have to live with awkward looking tires until replacement times comes around. Also worth noting that places online say to use armorall on it to 'make the scuff go away' this is false and only temporary. These tireshine products are all temporary and also damage the rubber because they use certain petroleum ingredients which degrade the rubber faster so definitely do not try to use that to remedy this as there is no way to do so.", "Quality tire at a good price!", "I needed a set of inexpensive tires and chose the Cooper Evolution Tour All-Season 215/60R16 95T Tire.

Recently a mechanic set me straight and said the rating can be viewed more for comfort than speed, because who drives 130 miles all the time? or even 110.\nThe T rated tires do have a softer wall than the H, and that's a good thing if you're looking for comfort, at the expense of a bit more feel. I think H rated is not bad either.\nSpecific to this tire, it's rated ok in terms of wear (600 or so), and at least the tire shop where I went to have these installed seem to think Cooper is a good brand.\nAnyways if I could get Bridg/Cont even closer to $100 I might have considered, but as it is, this is the best choice.\nConsider the alternative like the W rated Nokian, which are solid tires from Russia, or the Viva line from GY/Walmart. Even those are pricier than these, and after reading the bad reviews for the Viva, I decided to give these a try.\nRambling on... these are fairly quiet, but I thought they would be softer. They are softer than H tires, but just a tad.\nI got these for my daily commute on a Camry - stick shift that I just bought.", "In my Toyota RV4 2017. 131.000 mile\nGood delivery service; I arrive on time.

The ko2s are an aggressive offroad all terrain tire with ultra thick sidewall and make SO much noise. Ordered these because it was the cheapest but also had the best ratings for rain/snow compared to more pricier grand touring tires. There are NOT grand touring but standard touring tires. Tirerack will give you all the information you need but for my usage of highway and light snow use these tires were perfect and ride much more comfortably than the ko2's for obvious reasons.\n\nOne important thing worth mentioning is that these tires arrive EXTREMELY SCUFFED. They almost look used. Im not sure who is at fault here whether its the warehouse or UPS but these tires were scuffed around on all 4 ordered. Packaging was non existent. No ties or plastic or cardboard or anything just a packing sticker attached on the tread. I mean I know im not getting a perfectly packaged item here and the scuff is only cosmetic but dang.. some look pretty bad. Thankfully they werent directional so I had the shop install the lesser scuffed side on the outside face of the rim.\n\nI might try actually ordering through tirerack next time even if its a bit more because they have yet to deliver a scuffed tire to me and at least come with a 2 yr road hazard protection where these do not.\n\nJust to reiterate the scuffs were cosmetic only lightly on the surface, no sidewall damage was evident but unfortunatly tire scuffs cannot be taken off so have to live with awkward looking tires until replacement times comes around. Also worth noting that places online say to use armorall on it to 'make the scuff go away' this is false and only temporary. These tireshine products are all temporary and also damage the rubber because they use certain petroleum ingredients which degrade the rubber faster so definitely do not try to use that to remedy this as there is no way to do so.", "Quality tire at a good price!", "I needed a set of inexpensive tires and chose the Cooper Evolution Tour All-Season 215/60R16 95T Tire.

It does require a bit of strength to fold some of the sections, but nothing my skinny arms can\u2019t handle. Even though the handle is wood, it is comfortable. The cane remains quiet and does not slip unless on ice, of course. I do have one complaint but because this is such a superior cane, I couldn\u2019t even subtract a star for it. I do not like that the sleeve for holding the folded sections together comes separately. It is inconvenient to have to search through one\u2019s purse to find it - and that\u2019s even if one remembers to bring it along. :). This cane is so very elegant and unobtrusive.

The Cooper Discoverer True North is ideal for daily commuters who drive on plowed and treated roads, and deal with slush and black ice throughout the winter months. The Discoverer True North tire is Severe Weather Rated which is the 3 Peak Mountain Snowflake (3PMS) certified. This means the Discoverer True North meets the required performance criteria in snow testing to be considered severe snow service-rated. The Snow Groove Technology traps snow in the tread, enhancing grip through snow on snow traction. The noise dampening structures in the tread reduces noise generated from tire and road interaction.

That it smells nice was a plus, as let's face it: a lot of dandruff shampoos tend to smell terrible even when they try not to.\n\nDoes this help with dandruff or other scalp type issues? Well... yes and no. Obviously it's not going to replace actual dandruff shampoo. The charcoal is only a powder and as far as I know it's not activated, so it's not really meant as a replacement. However while I didn't notice any big differences, I did notice that it did seem to help my scalp a little - I think that this is the clarifying content in action, but I believe that the charcoal helped some. It worked well with the mint conditioner I tend to use, so my scalp felt nice and a little tingly afterwards. It doesn't really change the world for me as far as shampoos go, but it works well enough with my dyed hair and scalp.\n\nThe price for this isn't bad (even on Amazon, which is typically more expensive than my local store), so honestly this is something that I'll probably purchase on my own in the future as long as the boyfriend likes it.", "This seems to work the same as a clarifying shampoo. My hair has the same super clean feeling as when a use a clarifying. The one thing I did notice is that my hair felt sort of dry and raggedy after I rinsed it out, more so than with a typical clarifying shampoo, but it was fine after I used conditioner. I don't see any specific benefits or changes in my hair, but it's not bad if you just want/need a good cleaning now and then. I will use it the same as any clarifying shampoo. Wish it was sulfate free. Typically I get my stuff from salons and make sure to get sulfate free. I will keep this one in mind in the future for when I run out of my good stuff or need something quick when salons are closed etc. Overall it's not bad though. I mean, it does what it should - provide a good thorough clean.", "Charcoal, of course, has been used in filtering systems for eons due to its porous structure that traps impurities. Recently it seems to be the new fad to use it in a variety of products including toothpaste to help clean and whiten teeth. There is every reason to believe that it's inclusion in shampoo will be effective in doing the same to your hair and scalp which might be especially appealing to someone who works in dirty environments, heavily polluted cities or who works out heavily or uses topical hair products that might tend to accumulate over time. To me it seemed to be very effective doing a deep cleaning of my hair and scalp and I especially found the scent to be incredibly appealing.

We moved into an apartment to be closer to our family at the start of ongoing pandemic and I could not take all of my machines but sent them on to other users. I purchased the Brother SE 1900 as a way to accommodate working in a much smaller space and was very surprised at how easy, quiet and beautiful it sews. And it has over 8.3 inches of space to the right of the needle and excellent lighting.\n\nI did not think I would really like using a combination machine but I love it!!! It is very easy to switch between embroidery and sewing. The color touch screen is fantastic! I can see everything without a problem. The alphabet fonts on the Sewing side come out fairly large and crisp, and the Embroidery functions are very quiet and give beautiful stitch outs.\n\nThis machine does come with a knee lift and several feet. It does not come with an extension table for sewing; however, Brother sells an extension table that fits this model perfectly, SAWT4 Wide Table, 19 inches by 11 inches. This table is listed in the online catalog for Brother Accessories for the SE 1900 and the Brother Innovis 2750D.\n\nSince I also quilt, I purchased a generic Alpha Sew walking foot that is the same model as the Brother Branded SA140. Only this model of walking foot will work on the SE 1900. Other models cut too close to the needle and you could easily throw your timing off.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing other feet I would look at the Brother Accessories catalog first to get the precise parts number for that item. This will help you find either the correct Brother Brand or Generic Brand. If you look for a presser foot with a Brother dealer it will be easier if you have the Brother parts number. Otherwise, dealers will tell you rather curtly that they don't sell parts for the online Brother machines. (Ask me how I know this!).\n\nOne last FYI- this sewing and embroidery model comes with a bobbin case that is designed to take 60 weight bobbin thread for the Embroidery Functions, and it comes with a spool of 60 weight thread. The Brother embroidery only machines are designed to be used with 90 weight thread and have a different bobbin case for only embroidery. I still use my 90 weight bobbin thread without any problem for most of my embroidery and would probably use the 60 weight thread depending on how dense the design was.\n\nThere are very few folks on YouTube who have done tutorials on this machine. However, tutorials for the Brother PE 800 will certainly help you with mastering the embroidery functions. The user manual is very good and as well as the on screen help functions.

I bought it specifically for embroidery and it took me one or two days to figure out that I needed to put the \u201cQ\u201d foot on. Once I finally figured it out, I managed to stitch out one design that I had digitized. The outline didn\u2019t quite line up with some parts of the design so I went back on my computer and fixes it. The second time running the design, a small spring fell out while embroidering. The machine still was running fine and there seemed to be no problem with the embroidery function so I kept running the machine. I contacted customer support through brother and they were quick to respond and very helpful. I told them the issue and they will be contacting me on Monday since it\u2019s not a quick fix.

The auto treading works \"most\" of the time, but not always.\nThe threading issue, is a pain with all the moves & loops ya have to go through, especially when embroidering!! Multi color changes is a pain in the butt winding the thread around so many times even if ya get used to it.\nWould have been nice it they included more than one 5x7 hoop with this pricey of a machine! Including a 4x4, and a hat hoop would have been do'able for Brother without much dent in the profits.\nI really like the speed & quietness of this machine, it's \"Very Quiet\", more like a purr...\nA direct connection with a USB cable would be great for this machine rather than having to download to a flash-drive making it another step to deal with.\nLot's of stitching patterns built in, most of which you'll never use but it's a nice offering.\nEven with the few...very few faults it has I'm happy we went with the SE1900 thus far, it's a solid smooth running, fast & quiet machine that gets the job done!\n\n***UPDATE***\n\nWe wanted to use a smaller hoop for less waste & smaller embroidery. Ordered a 4x4 hoop off here from Brother SA443 that was advertised for this machine. When it arrived we tried to attach it, but it failed to lock on and was difficult to fit into the arm's pegs. Contacted Brother prior to returning and they verified it was the right hoop perhaps just a bad one.\nI tried a return & replace and when the 2nd one arrived it locked right in! We were very happy for a few moments. After attempting to try a simple design the material bunched down the grates and was eaten.\nMy wife said something just didn't feel right about the hoop riding so low but we re-hooped fabric for another try.\nThe cloth was eaten again and had to be cut out!!! After inspecting it, the hoop was definitely riding on the arm causing the backing & fabric to be too low. Comparing the 5x7 hoop it came with versus the 4x4 made by Brother I saw the metal attachments are different The 5x7 has an \"L\" shaped bracket raising it off the embroidery machines arm, and the 4x4's doesn't, it's just a straight piece of metal to lock it on (if it fits).\n\nIt's sad, this is a nice machine and would seem to be a simple fix for Brother to do.\nHad I known this I would not have purchased this machine!!\nI certainly can not recommend the SE1900 now.", "I loved the machine. Easy to use and excellent quality.", "The machine is impressive! I have been embroidering for just a few months but I researched the hobby for about a year.

I decided to dive in and the first se1900 purchased from The Brother Store had a malfunction, Brother replaced it with a new one right away! This machine functions perfectly. 5x7 is a good hoop size but I bought the 4 pack of hoops from another vendor with a 5x12 hoop and combine embroidery files. It is easy to transfer .PES files via usb. I use Brother pe-design 10 bought at discount from a competitors website. Installed on a embroidery only/no internet pc and was good to sew! Unless you just want to buy designs or hunt free ones, you will need to find a good digitizing software. Free software is out there if you are savvy but nothing with auto digitize or photostitch like the paid versions. The auto threader is better than my Baby Lock bl40's and makes changing thread easy and hasn't failed me. The \"New Brothread\" 60 weight Brother colors are reliable and inexpensive, you don't need top of the line overpriced thread. Switching to sewing mode is simple and the se1900 has more options than I will ever use but it's nice to know they are there. Soooooo much support is available online for this model. I just refer to the manual and watch videos whenever I have a question. The touch screen is easy to see and user friendly but the tutorial videos helped prepare me. Amazon was the best price I could find and it pays to watch for fluctuation. The price changes sometimes daily. I bought when it was low. Its not real heavy and I just use the plastic bag it was wrapped in as a dust cover. The shipping box took a beating but the machine wasn't touched at all, really good packaging. I'm not spoiled by high end, bells and whistles yet but this is a good start to finance a multi needle machine in the future. The sky is the limit when paired with my ScanNCut. I'm just pumped to finally have a creative outlet.....thanks.", "Play Video\n For the money this is a good machine.

I always have it up because When I finish embroidery project I don\u2019t have to convert it to straight sewing. I just walk over to this machine and sew. I mainly purchased this machine for the weight. My other machines are just too heavy to cart two classes or quilt groups. The machine is mostly manual. It has a Needle threader that is manually pushed But at least it Threads the machine. These old eyes can\u2019t do it easily. The lift is also manual which I have a hard time getting used to but it\u2019s not a big deal. In some ways it\u2019s hard to go from electronic machine to a manual machine but I mostly use this for straight stitching and it\u2019s not bad. The machine embroidery side of it works more electronically, just have to lift the foot manually. All and all I\u2019m happy with this machine. I wanted a baby lock but they were so expensive that I decided on this.", "Play Video\n Everything about this machine is amazing. I couldn\u2019t be more happier. I started using the machine right away and I have created so many projects l already. I\u2019m so happy I bought it. Doesn\u2019t give me any problems at all. Took me some time to learn it\u2019s features and I\u2019m still learning. But over all I\u2019m supper happy with everything from sewing to embroidery from this machine.", "Love the touch screen, needle threader, thread cutter. Wonderful machine.", " I have wanted to start embroidering for some time now. This was the perfect starter (single needle) machine.", "I have only had the machine for 1 week. Will update if necessary-\nPROS - Very intuitive to use. The layout is well thought out and it is easy to follow the instruction and begin embroidering/sewing within a few minutes. I look forward to spending more time learning how to use it. There is a bit of a learning curve. I already broke 2 needles, but that is part of the process. Even when you have to rethread the bobbin or after breaking a needle, the machine gets you right back to where you left off and the embroidery does not show at all where the problem occurred. I am happy to have discovered that while in the learning process.\nCON -\nOne of the top complaints on the BROTHER facebook pages is that the USB drive/port takes a LOT of work to figure out. I wish a compatible USB flash drive came with the machine so that so much time was not wasted trying to figure out how to make it work. (So far, I have gotten a virgin drive, reformatted to a FAT 32 - which does not come on a MAC- uploaded only individual PES format files -not in a folder- and after ALL of this, it still will not read the USB drive. The next step -according to their directions- is to get a different flash drive, but it makes no mention of the specs for that flash drive, I am reluctant to spend $$ on something that may or may not work.) For the amount of money that is charged for that machine, I wish the manufacturer would also include a compatible flash drive.", "It\u2019s so sweet! Sews like a dream, ! I was able to even quilt on this machine. The arm is a little longer than normal machines and so it gave me a little more space for the quilt. I did try the embroidery feature, and you have to be careful with the bobbin case and the type of thread you use in the bobbin case. Especially when doing embroidery. It\u2019s very touchy. I actually chipped one with a needle. Be sure to buy needles in bulk, because of the speed in the amount of time you\u2019re going to be working with it the needles will get hot and will warp. Give yourself grace and practice on a lot of things before you do your main project. The needle threader is awesome!", "Very nice sewing machine only disappointed\nThat it didnt come with a case cover for the price", "Before I write my frustrations I would like to mention the machine itself %100 works and is definitely almost like new. I'm very happy with my purchase since I got it a lil cheaper than retail price. I upgraded from an SE600 and so far I'm loving this machine!! If I were you I'd buy this new though.\n\nThat being said, to the previous owner of the machine: what is wrong with you?????? Who treats a 1k machine this way? Upon receiving it, everything came in poorly packaged (Thanks amazon) and small pieces were flying everywhere inside. The lever on the side that threads the needle automatically was in pieces and I had to open the front part to reassemble it. I'm not entirely sure how that even happened but thankfully the threader still works! On the side where the ruler painted on the machine is a mysterious stain that feels terrible to the touch and is impossible to completely clean off. There are also several accessories missing, along with some of the more important stuff I need like the embroidery foot, needles and the knee lifter. Luckily, the embroidery portion of the machine came in brand new and untouched. My annoyance was mostly on the way the machine was treated honestly. Im just glad it isnt broken. Shame on you previous owner smfh.", "It will be years before I run out of features to explore on this incredible sewing and embroidery machine. The 5x7 embroidery area is more than adequate for embroidering logos onto clothing and everything else you can squeeze under the presser foot. With a repositionable hoop, you can do 5x12 wide imagery. The sewing ability of the machine is at least as impressive as the embroidery functionality.

This rug is soft and comfortable. We did put a felt rug pad so it is cushy too. My dogs immediately laid on it - approved before I even trimmed the rug pad. The pattern does get a little lost - It shows in photos but not really in person but it still looks nice. Hubby said it looks like a toasted marshmallow.", "Overall impression: I like/love it. Obviously, I ordered 4 of them in total. You can't beat the price and overall the rug looks really nice. It's a pain to flatten and to get all the folds and kinks out, but if you work it enough, it'll happen. I'd recommend giving this rug a shot if you're thinking about it.\n\nPro's:\n- The price is nearly unbeatable, especially for the size. I ordered (2) 8x10's and (2) 6x9's and to get a quality 8x10 rug for under $100 is nearly unheard of.\n- Nice image quality. From a distance, the rug looks great. Beautiful pattern giving it a nice, worn-vintage look.\n- Arrived quickly. Every rug I ordered said it would take four business days and it always took two. Bonus!\n- Low odor. Not bothersome, but aired out quickly enough.\n\nCons:\n- A pain to flatten out. 3/4 carpets came with FOLDS in them, which is kind of a pain to work out. Lots of \"kneading out\" and use of weights and other heavy objects, but eventually it does the trick.\n- Up close, the design looks very \"pixilated.\" You can probably see from a few of my close-up shots. This doesn't really bother me because even though I'm a stickler for details, I'm not going to be staring at my rug up-close, but it might bother some people.\n- One of my rugs came with what looked like bird poop on it. I noticed some other reviewers mentioned this too, so at least I'm not going crazy. It's disappointing but returnable, so not a huge issue but quite inconvenient to have to send something so big back.\n\nOther note: I drove myself crazy looking at images of the rugs trying to get a sense of true color. This rug has a sort of \"light/dark effect\" depending on which way you are looking at the rug (photo example #2 and #3). From one direction the rug has a lighter, softer gray coloring but if you walk to the other side and look at it, it's a darker, charcoal-ish gray look, so quite literally- the rug looks lighter or darker depending on how you look at it. This might be helpful to know before you buy.\n\nHope this helps someone!", "\"So this is love...hmm-mm\" \ud83e\udd70\nThis is my second rug from this seller and wow am I in love.

I tried to skip a day to see if I noticed a difference and I definitely noticed a difference.\n\nI am not a huge fan of taking pills, so the fact that I can take these in the form of a gummy is much more appealing. I definitely would recommend these to a friend or acquaintance.", "This has a very good flavor that even children will love! We I have noticed that just the 5mg is plenty.

Fair warning if you use these and then stay up on your phone or computer it won't work. You need to turn off all light and relax.", "Love how well these work! Easy deep sleep pretty quickly after eating.", "After my first few doses, I was ready to throw these gummies in the medicine cabinet and never pull them out again, but I'm glad I stuck with them. Although they would help me fall asleep relatively quickly, they weren't helping me stay asleep - however, after consistently taking them every night at around the same time, I began to see better results. As others have pointed out, they taste pretty good and are an excellent alternative for people that don't like taking pills. The only drawback is that I prefer to do my whole pre-bed routine (brush my teeth, walk the dog, etc.) before taking melatonin so that I can get in bed and read or watch a show while it kicks in - unless you want to go to sleep with little gummy bits stuck in your teeth, that's not an option. All in all, I like these enough to buy again, but I might try another brand to compare.", "I absolutely love this brand! I\u2019ve tried so many and where they might get me to sleep fast, I\u2019ve had the weirdest dreams or the taste is disgusting. Vitafive has it all in my books.

I tried 2 gummies 3 nights in a row, and had stressful dreams and woke up sweaty. I then tried just 1 gummy for 2 more nights with the same results. Typically I would just stop taking and move on, however I was inclined to leave a review (my first ever) after my friend had the exact same response to these gummies. She is someone who regularly takes melatonin, and she did not know I had these symptoms when I gave her the bag I purchased. That said, it could just be that this was a weird batch or both of us are having a bad reaction to the melatonin. However, this was strange enough that I wanted to make potential consumers aware of our reactions however. I am giving the product 3 starts because of the taste, texture, eco-friendly packaging, and ease of shipment. I took of 2 stars because of our reaction.

This package fits easily in any nightstand drawer and seals up nicely for that stay fresh taste. These work well, taste good and are a real win. It's nice to be able to eat one or two, or three depending on the transition I am going through from prescription sleep aids. My doctor said it could require more melatonin per person depending on past sleep-aid prescriptions and also the amount of energy drinks or coffee I drink so I am finding that right balance.

It was a present for my daughter and she loved it!", "The Brother SQ9185 is a good, reasonably-priced beginner's sewing machine, but for someone looking for a solid, overall machine with staying power, this is not your best choice.\n\nI have a Janome 6600, a solid, heavy, quality machine that costs 10x this one, as well as a Janome Jem Platinum 760 which is about 3x the cost of this Brother. I wanted to test out the Brother because the large number of decorative stitches that differ from my other platforms. I also wanted a machine that I could take to classes without worrying about mishaps. After testing this machine out, I think I'll continue to take the Janome Jem with me. The Brother is okay, but I would wonder if issues were from the machine or the technique I was trying.\n\nThat being said, here's the good:\n+ Good value for the price. This machine comes loaded with tons of stitches and features, including an extension table to give you a larger sewing platform.\n+ Tons of accessories. It comes with a number of feet, including a free motion quilting / darning foot, \u00bc\" quilt piecing foot, a quilting walking foot, zig-zag, buttonhole, overcasting, monogramming, zipper, blind stitch and button fitting foot. It also comes with basic accessories--needles, bobbins, cleaning brush, seam ripper, tiny screwdriver, spool caps in various sizes, and extra spool pin.\n+ Great features. Needle threader, needle down, reverse, slow speed buttons.\n+ 130 Decorative Stitches. Nice stitches. The Monogram is ONLY in CAPS.\n+ Free Arm. The Janome 6600 doesn't have one--it is primarily a quilting machine. It's the ONLY detractor of this machine. I need a free-arm when I'm making bags. Otherwise, I love my Janome.\n\nThe not so good:\n- Feels flimsy, cheap. It's all plastic. You can feel it. It's really lightweight, which makes it vibrate as you sew.\n- Loud. Really loud when you're sewing.\n- Tension issues. Right off the bat, I had bobbin tension issues. See my photograph.\n- Confusing operation. It was driving me crazy, trying to figure out how to adjust the needle left or center. Then I realized that it isn't an adjustment--it's a STITCH setting. Huh? Yes, I could take it out of the box and stitch straight. But the controls are not readily intuitive, and the instruction manual is HORRIBLE. Just figuring out what the three stitch settings (Utility, Monogram, Mirror Image) had me flipping back and forth throughout the book. I still haven't determined how to use the mirror image stuff.\n- \u00bc\" Foot. It's a visual guide instead of an actual ledge to direct the fabric. What's the use of a \u00bc\" foot if you don't have a fabric guide?\n\nAfter using this machine on a few seams, plus trying out about half the stitches, I'd probably use this for decorative stitching and keep it as a back-up machine. Or give it as a gift to a beginner. If it had been heavier weight / more substantial, I probably would have given it 4 stars. It's okay, but not great.", "Full disclosure - this review comes from my better half, as I am quite likely to injure myself when operating something as complex as a sewing machine . . .\n\nI have been sewing since I was a child, mostly for the home and kids' costumes. I've never owned a high-end machine, and my current machine is a wonderful mid-range workhorse, but I've been wanting a budget machine since two of my kids have become interested in sewing. This machine exceeds what I would have expected at this price point.\n\nObservations: All of the usual tools and attachments come with this machine, as well as a small quilting table attachment. This machine threads slightly differently than what I'm used to, as does the needle threader. Both are easy to master though, and the bobbin operates just like other machines I'm used to. Having read a few comments about how you need to refer to the manual to learn how to thread it, I agree but don't see this as a negative. Sewing machines have several moving parts and this is to be expected in my opinion. It took me about 5 minutes to get these steps down, and about 10 minutes to teach it to one of my kids. I also spent about 10 minutes with the manual learning about the digital commands and what the buttons do that I'm unfamiliar with. I was then able to give the machine a spin.\n\nPros:\n- The digital command is convenient and makes for quick stitch pattern change\n- There are lots of interesting and fun stitches\n- The machine is operable without a foot pedal. I've never owned a machine with this option and I fell in love with it immediately. While testing some of the interesting stitches I was able focus on turning the fabric and not worry about the speed. There are only 3 speeds without the foot pedal so the foot pedal is important when you need more precise control over your speed, but I can see sewing without it more than with it.\n- Another thought about sewing without the foot pedal - teaching my daughter to sew on this machine was very easy using the slow speed and no pedal so she could focus on the fabric.\n- When you stop stitching the machine automatically ends with the needle in the fabric, making fabric rotation easy.\n- The machine won't let you start sewing with the presser foot in the up position.\n- The included quilting table is a very useful medium size for most projects.\n- Tension was perfect out of the box and I didn't need to make any adjustments when I started test sewing.\n\nCons:\n- When sewing without the foot pedal and you want to stop stitching you have to hit an \"off\" button that is placed poorly, on the down-slope of toward the bottom of the front of the machine.\n- The machine is very lightweight compared to my daily machine. This makes me worry that it won't be able to handle heavy-duty sewing like layers of denim, or maybe won't last as long as my current machine. I'm not taking any stars off for this because I can't imagine finding a machine for less than $200 that can truly handle heavy-duty sewing.\n\nI can see using this machine a lot and am very impressed with the kind of performance it gives at this price point. And considering that Brother produces consistently top-quality machines I think this machine would be an excellent choice for anyone new to sewing or looking for an affordable machine for occasional use.", "It's a good back up machine. Or a good learning machine. Once you are ready to take off the training wheels you will want something more substantial. Out of the box it was pretty straight forward. The million stitches look like they could be a lot of fun but I had trouble with the tension and had to adjust it. Work slowly and steady and it will do the job. Lightweight and pretty straight forward, adjusting it for my needs had me going to the book more than once.", "If you are, as they say, a person \"of a certain age\", or the child of one or,if family history was in your interest, the grandchild of one; and that person came from one of the more \"old country\" areas of Europe, and they settled in the New York area, the odds are extremely high that you (or your parent/grandparent) was or knew a tailor.\n\nAnd that tailor worked on a sewing machine (maybe a Singer, but more likely a Necchi) that was the approximate size of a wardrobe lying on it's side, and it was operated by foot pedals, only much later replaced by electricity. And that tailor scrimped and saved to, dream of dreams, be able to buy his (they WERE mostly male) own machine to operate from home and make, if not a fortune, a decent living. But that wasn't easy as any moderately decent machine, say, one that could be used to do two, three, even four different stitches, would run the equivalent of thousands of today's dollars.\n\nAnd,today we have this: one of the lower end machines available (not in quality, but in its severely limited ability to handle ONLY 130; and to be ready to operate in minutes; and to take up less table space than some laptops; and to be so easy to use that a reasonably adept preteen could use it (I speak from experience) and that casts the equivalent of 1/10th of the older machines\n\nI mean... c'mon!", "We've always been a sewing family, from my 80 year old mother to the rest of us, everyone can use the old pedestal Singer or the Elna SU that we got back in 1975 or so and which we still refer to as the \"new\" sewing machine. Jump forward almost half a century and the world of sewing machines has changed quite a bit. No more swapping out mechanical cams to change stitch design, and we now have electronically rather than mechanically actuated gearing. First step, then, was to figure out what we didn't know, since you can put any 1960s era sewing machine in front of any of us and we're off and running. This took some reading of the instruction manual (well illustrated and described) and some test fabric and thread.\n\nAfter a few weeks, we've grown quite comfortable with the Brother. It's lightweight and easy to move around, which makes it easy to place where the sun is shining on our work if desired. But it's sturdy and holds position well despite its light weight. The built-in LED lighting is a real upgrade for us as well. Overall the sewing process works quite well, and the Brother easily handles a variety of fabrics without difficulty. Several of us were very impressed by the ability to set the needle so that it will stop in the down or up position as desired. Working on shirt sleeves or pants cuffs is easy thanks to the free arm, and larger areas of fabric are also easy to work with thanks to the extension table.\n\nWe have only one issue that we've noted....first, there's a small screwdriver to loosen and tighten the presser foot holder. This is a little too small and difficult to grasp. We initially were annoyed that we couldn't tell what foot went with what stitch until choosing the stitch, but then we noticed a section of the manual (starting on page 81) describing all of that.\n\nOther than these very minor points, the Brother has served us all well for quite a few weeks now. It has taken a little practice to get used to threading everything - quite different from our Elna and certainly the older Singer - but we've got it down now. I suspect we will still use the Elna as our go-to sewing machine for easy straight stitches on uncomplicated fabric, but for anything more complex, we'll be utilizing the Brother.", "This machine has pros and cons, but in general I like it. Most of the cons are fairly minor. Note that for any large quilting you'll need a long arm machine; this will be ok for a small project, but not for a full sized quilt.\n\nPros:\n-It is has three sewing speeds, which means you can get straight lines done incredibly quickly but easily slow done for tricky corners or curves.\n-You have the option of sewing with a foot pedal or by simply pressing a button that starts and stops the stitching. This is very nice if your ankle gets sore during long projects.\n-The computerized stitching options are easy to use, and there's a wider variety than I personally will likely required.\n-The machine sews smoothly, and I have had no problems once I get it properly threaded.\n\nCons:\n-Bobbin winding is built in such a way that the bobbin cannot be wound more than half full, which means you have to change the bobbin a lot more than necessary.\n-Upper and lower threading are both difficult. Most of the machines I've used are significantly easier to thread. Here you have to slot the thread just right through areas tucked in the machine where you're fingers don't actually fit, so you just have to do it over and over again and hope for the best.\n-Most of the accessories, like the feet and bobbins, are made from pretty cheap, weak plastic, rather than sturdy metal. I don't think they'll last long.\n-To switch from pedal to automatic sewing, you need to turn the machine off and back on again.", "I own a couple of Brother machines \u2013 an older model very similar to this one and a serger. I\u2019ve found them to hold up well over the years. For context, I have self-taught sewing skills and have primarily sewn over the last 20 years or so to make curtains, pillows, basic clothing, alterations, crafts, etc.\n\nOut of the box, this machine is pretty easy to use along with the instruction book. I recommend skipping the quick set up guide that just has images and using the instruction manual which is much easier to follow. This machine threads differently than my other one and I would have never figured it out with the pictures. The full instruction manual is also included in Spanish.\n\nThis is a great value for all of the features and accessories. I love, love the table extension and found it very helpful.\n\nThe embroidery (all caps) is tricky at first. The instructions are decent here but it definitely takes some trial and error. There is an adjustment process available in the settings and while it was helpful in improving the lettering, it took quite a bit of tweaking that I was mostly guessing about.\nThere are sections in the instructions for the different uses for this machine that will get you started but like any machine, it will take a bit to get to know how things will work with different fabrics and just what changes will occur when the settings are changed.\n\nI think this machine is best for someone like me or as a starter machine for someone who wants to put the time into learning to sew and create. I would not necessarily recommend this to someone who\u2019s not comfortable with the computerized aspect. There is a lot of time here consulting the manual and pressing a variety of different buttons to get this set up correctly. If you use particular functions often, these could easily be memorized along with the guides printed on the machine. I have young kids who are very interested in me sewing. While still a ways off, this will be a good machine to teach them on and I feel confident it will hold up for a long time based on my experience with my other Brother machines.\n\nLastly, this does not come with a cover which is a bit disappointing. I suppose I could make one.", "When I bought my first sewing machine, it was a brother, at the time the most highly rated machine on Amazon. I had not used a sewing machine since I was a child and was effect6ively a beginner. The machine had been described as one you could grow into, but as a beginner I had a great deal of trouble setting it up. I have since gotten a very basic Singer, and it is what I use most of hte time. My daughter, however, took a class in high school in which she learned to use a sewing machine and so has much better knowledge and skills than I. She also uses it for much more complicated projects. While I mostly use it to hem my husband's pants, she makes some of her own clothes. She recently decided to move back home after a number of years in Ohio, following college. Because shipping is so expensive to Hawaii she is selling or giving away most of what she owns. she was very glad to hear that there was a sewing machine here as god as the one she is letting go, also a brother. When I got her one I wanted it to be the best for her. She has been very hjappy with it, and I suspect she will love this one. It also enables me to do some things I can not do with my Singer, with 130 stitches, it can do monogramming, button holes in a range of sizes. My latest project is storage for my glass. I am making rolls, like knife rolls to store expensive, precious metal infused glass. With this machine I can label each roll for easy identification, so that when I am working I can quickly find the color I want, and have it safgee and scratch and dust free when it is not in use. My daugfhter wil be back in around a week, and then it is hers, but this is a project I can likely finish before sher comes back, and if I can't I can ask her to do the monogramming for me. This machine offers all the basic stitches and a variety of decvorative stitches, it would be great for many projects, and has already improved one I had started before it arrived. I am not sure I woulkd recommend it for rank beginners, as I was a few years ago, but could be one someone could easily grow into..", "Good little starter machine. It's got a billion stitches which is fun, especially for my kids. We have had problems with the tension. I have had to turn it all the way down to 1 just to get it to work at all, but it works. My least favorite part is threading the machine because one of the doohickeys you have to hook the thread on is hidden way deep inside of the machine and you just have to pray that you can hook it in there. I also have a Bernina which I adore. On my Bernina, the doohickey is much more accessible. If you are going to sew a LOT, this may not be the machine for you. If you just have to hem some curtains or a pair of jeans here and there, this is a great priced machine and I'd say go for it.", "No set up, just take it out and plug it in. It even already had thread on the bobbin! It's very easy to find the controls and follow guide lines on the machine.\n\nThere are tons of accessories! Mine came with a small seam ripper, a quilting hook, many different sewing feet, and much more.\n\nThe instruction manual was confusing because it used terms and names that I didn't know, but luckily that wasn't a problem because they included an instructional DVD with visual instructions. The video was about 20 minutes and explained how to use everything on the machine.\n\nThe sewing machine has tons of different stiches, including embroidery stitching. My favorite thing about the stitching are the letters. Older embroidery machines can take a very long time to stitch letters, but this machine barely takes longer than any other embroidery stitch.\n\nWhen I first started sewing with this machine I noticed something that bothered me a lot... Every minute or so the spool would fly off the spool holder! I was using a medium spool cap to keep the medium sized spool in place, so that shouldn't have been happening. I tried the large spool cap, and that worked! I just wish the medium spool had more resistance.\n\nThe machine seems quality made and very durable for normal use, but it's definitely not 'drop on concrete' proof. The machine is light enough for me to move around, but it's kinda clumsy to carry. It has a handle on the side, but I would imagine you'd get an ache really fast trying to carry it any real distance. There is a case you can buy to protect the machine during transportation, but it isn't included with the machine. I just pack the machine back in the box when I want to bring it somewhere.\n\nThere are a lot of different pieces, and if you lost some of them the machine would be hard to use. The sewing machine feet are very important, because depending on which stitch you choose, a different foot is required.\n\nThis machine has LOTS of features. Even friends who are experienced at sewing didn't know what half the things on the machine were for! It also gets hot after a period of continuous use, but it's perfect for light to medium use. I love it!", "No modern sewing machines hold a candle to older models in that they use a lot more plastic over metal and tend to have more electronics, which can lead to more malfunctions from parts breaking or something going haywire. That being the case, as far as newer sewing machines go, this one seems to work pretty well and hopefully will stand the test of time. Perhaps has more features than I need, but it does the basics well and more if you need it to.", "Had it for a year an I'm officially fed up with it! Auto threader broke 7mos in. It struggles to make a simple face mask.\n\nToday I decided to try the walking foot and make a rag quilt. Guess what? This \"so called\" quilting machine, snagged, sputtered, and flat out refused to sew thru two layers of flannel.\n\nI'm now researching other brands. Life is too short to get frustrated with poorly built, low quality sewing machines.", "Easy to learn even for older sewers. My wife is in her eighties (the younger part) and is not as computer savvy as those decades younger, but enough so for regular computer and tablet use. So, no neophyte, but a previous computerized sewing machine was ridiculously difficult to learn (and for me, and I\u2019ve worked with computers since the 1960s).\n\nBut, she really wanted to try this one for some projects she has going with our daughter-in-law that requires my wife to provide most of the machine labor.\n\nThe key to her being able to use this nearly immediately was the included DVD and the useful manual. She took the time to actually make use of those before experimenting.\n\nBasics: push button on/off; foot pedal. The flat bed attachment has a storage compartment for extra bobbins, needles, etc. This bed slips on and off easily for sleeves and pant legs. There are five different presser feet. The machine is easy to thread and load bobbins.\n\nSupposedly this does 99 different stitches (we didn\u2019t count them) for quilting, applique, zigzag, etc (not going to list them either). It even does letters and numbers.\n\nIn operation, it works smoothly without problems.", "I was long overdue for a sewing machine as mine was nearly 30 years old. For quite some time I had been wanting to replace it with one of these computerized sewing machines but I found the task and price to be a little daunting. When I saw this one, though, it just felt right. The price is very good and while there are a lot of options to the stitches it didn't seem to be overwhelming. I find that it is perfect for a beginner to this 'new' computerized style of sewing machine and was happy to see that it came with an instructions DVD. There are also several videos online that you can watch to help familiarize yourself with all of the functions. This sewing machine comes with all of the needed accessories and there is nothing further you will need to buy other than materials. It is a fairly lightweight machine but I do not feel that it seems cheaply made at all. On the contrary it feels very well made. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a cover but I am going to have my first sewing project with it be making a cover. I would highly recommend this machine and am very happy with it. I can only hope that it stands the test of time but being that it is a Brother machine I believe that it will.", "This is a great machine to get started with. I had another that was just too basic and realized I wanted one that wasn't too complicated but still had more features. This fits the bill. If you are trying to decide on a basic model, keep that in mind because you will soon want more and wish you had spent just a little more to get the extras instead of having to buy a new one or just wishing you had. The monogramming letters are just a basic capital block letter. I was a little disappointed in that but it is fantastic overall. I am not advanced in my sewing as my sister is and I don't need to spend over a grand on a machine as she does. This is just right if you are like me.", "This is the first computerized machine I have ever used. The Brother SQ9185 comes with a comprehensive operating manual, plus a DVD, plus online customer support. It has been very comprehensive to learn about and use (which knowing very little about sewing machines) is extremely valuable. Any question I may have, I know there are many sources to reference which I greatly appreciate....Thank you, Brother!\n\nI am a basic-seamstress who does smaller projects like hemming curtains and making pillow cases. This sewing machine is inspiring me to do my first quilt. It has an extended work-space that will prove to be useful for larger projects (like the quilt).\n\nIt has 130 stitches that are beyond my wildest imagination. I am grateful for the 3 sewing speeds the Brother provides considering there is not a pedal which I have found I was reliant upon.\n\nI am excited to use all the features of this machine and take off creatively a variety of sewing projects.", "After almost 15 years, our Singer died. I do not sew, but my husband does. He also works on computers for a living. A computerized sewing machine?! So, yes, I had to get it. This machine worked through several thick pieces of fabric. He had to replace the needle a few times but it wasn't the machines fault. The auto threader thing works great. As a beginner... like I have never worked on a sewing machine ever... I had an easy time with this. My very 1st project was a strait line on an old t-shirt... I didn't break anything nonetheless. I am very pleased with this machine and personally want to try bigger projects. The user manual is very easy to follow and extremely helpful for a beginner. Just a few quirks but I attribute them to the user and not the machine. My husband tried almost every feature and loves it. Now, we just hope this lasts as long as our Singer did.", "I have not had a new sewing machine in many, many years. My trusted machine saw me through sewing for my children and then my grandchildren. Imagine my surprise at receiving this Brother SQ9185 Computerized Sewing and Quilting machine!! I feel like I am in sewing heaven. Where has this been all my life? It was lightweight right out of the box. Instructions were easy to understand but if they are not for you there is a Helpline number included that will walk you through any problems you have. It has more stitch designs than you can count. The removable arm makes it easy to be flush on the table for intricate quilting. I had some tension issues at first and realized I was using the wrong bobbin for my task. Easy fix! After using my 40 year old machine this one is pure pleasure.

Was a little uncertain about buying furniture here as once it\u2019s built it\u2019s very difficult to take apart and return but I\u2019m really happy with it and like the cord organizer in the middle of the table. Hard to beat for the price. There are many other tables triple and 4x the price. And this one, for me anyway, looks really nice. Not sure what I\u2019d be getting for 4x more money.", "Love this table. Looks as pictured, is sturdy and well constructed, and was easy to assemble.

It is commercial quality and both the laminate and the pressed wood are very thick, dense, and strong.\n\nThe color is mostly accurate to the photo. It's a nice dark mocha/espresso color. You can still see the wood grain (which looks nice) in bright light or if you look closely. It's not black like some of the other \"espresso\" colored furniture. I don't normally like brown or wood colored furniture, but I love the color of this table.\n\nThe table can fit 3 chairs on each end, but it's a little too close for comfort. a 10' table would be more suited to that arrangement.

Not a high end thick laminate, some slight imperfections on the edge banding (small pimples) but for me will only get light use. The price dropped a few times the longer it was in my cart.

I put about 150 miles on them today and I think they are fantastic, if you are thinking about this tire don't think too long the price is great and the tires perform even better.

Had to contact this low tire price company to get my 4th tire and they tried to blame it on fed x , Did they think I wouldn't notice? The tires look great and are exactly what I expected. If I ever get the 4th one I'll put them on my truck. Just don't get it, why would you even send 3.\n\nWow. tiers are on the truck and they are impresive. the agressive tread pattern had me thinking they would be a little loud but I was wrong. Very quiet tire.\nGreat ride, excellent cornering little to no roll over even at a high enough speed to get these tires to make some noise.\nAnd these are some beefy tires. Even with the factory size for the truck They fill up the wheel well really nice, almost an inch wider on the tread then the fierstones I burned through in about 20,000 miles. With a nice design that shows safety on the highway and a sidewall with a molded mud grabber design that makes me want to find somewhere to try to get stuck.\nAll in all, I say, theese could be the some of the best tires out there. And at this price they could blow the rest away.", "I really enjoy these tires. The road noise is virtually nonexistent. I mean I really have to listen to not hear them. My truck needed a front end alignment. So, I of visited Toyota and had them align the front end right after I had these tires installed. The tire installer couldn't believe the price I purchased them for. He couldn't do that good on the price. I've had them on my truck for just over six months now and don't have any complaints. I highly recommend this seller! The tires were new when they arrived with the rubber pieces that wear off after road use, model stickers stuck on the tread and various color markings on the tread of each tire. I would give the seller six stars but I'm limited to five. Cheers!", "These are the tires I have put on my multple Jeeps for over 12 years and the only tire my husband put on bioth his personal and company truck. This are great in the snow and dry roads.", "Nice tires", "I used to like my new tires but now almost 2months after i got them 1 of them is leaking, so now I'm a 60 year old gammy tugging a air compressor around with me to keep adding air to my tire. Now put that picture in your head", "Wry good tread pattern for winter driving expected them to be loud but found them to be quiet .", "Switched from Nokians to Coopers. They perform almost as good as the Nokians on snow/ice covered roads, which is saying a lot, as the Nokians are the best in the world imo. Off-road in the mud, snow, ice, etc. is awesome. So, if you want a winter rated tire to get you up the mountain legally, but still want to rip around the trails, these are your best option.

When I was expecting my first child, I wanted a diaper that was eco-friendly, hypoallergenic, and made without all the crazy chemicals. (While these aren't perfectly eco-friendly) Pampers is a reputable brand, I work in the children's hospital and this is the brand we give to our patients - I was happy to find the Pampers Pure because they contain less ingredients than the regular Pampers.\nI have used this brand from day one for my son, we never had any major problems with leaks, whenever he would leak it was time to size up. There is one issue I have with the diaper as we have sized up over the years (he is in size 5 now) and that is how long the diapers are. These are larger than the regular Pampers, and several other diaper brands I have seen out there. You may be thinking, well larger is better to hold the big messes - and I would agree except that it awkwardly holds in the bowel movements and often times they will get too bottom heavy and start sliding down. Its not a huge deal, we have used this brand for a year and a half and started my daughter in them as well. I am going to experiment a bit and buy the Honest brand for the next month, as I put a trial/sample diaper on my daughter the other day and loved that they fit her around well, and did not ride high on her belly button or create a bulge in the back.", "Diapers can be a widely varied personal preference and also one that involves significant costs over time. Personally, my wife and I have settled on the Pampers Pure lineup because we\u2019ve experienced the best results with them. Other diapers tended to lead to more rashes and whenever we switched back to these, we noticed the rashes disappeared. I\u2019m general, this leads to a happier and healthier child so it has made everyone\u2019s life easier.\n\nWe also noticed that these tended to fit our baby better than the competitors with minimal leaks. There will always be some leak no matter which company you go with.\n\nAs for the chemical odors other people are mentioning, my wife has the smell of a bloodhound and complains at the slightest whiff of something foul. This is not something we have ever experienced and if we did, I\u2019d never hear the end of it. We would also just assume that it might\u2019ve been a bad batch but I think we\u2019d write Amazon or the company out of concern, but most likely to back to using a new box of them anyways because they are so good.", "After much deliberation and 2+ months worth of everyday use here is my review:\n\nThese diapers are incredibly similar, if not the exact same as Pampers Swaddlers. You are only paying extra for the cute designs on the diapers. Yes they are great for sensitive skin, but so are pampers swaddlers\u2014 Keep in mind I can only speak for my personal experience. My son has eczema and has flare ups when his skin does not agree with a product. Before switching to these diapers I exclusively used pampers swaddlers. I cannot say whether if it\u2019s worth it or not to pay more for cute designs because that\u2019s subjective.\n\nThe biggest issue I have now encountered is that leaking is a constant issue now that my LO is constantly on the move. It is most common during the day, but has even happened at night while baby is asleep. So in my experience I\u2019d say the life of these is probably up until your baby begins to be very active. These were great up until then, but I have since switched to a different brand.", "Honest company diapers are supposed to be pretty clean and wonderful for baby's precious bottoms. Sadly, they caused a terrible, full butt, bright red rash. It was terrible and I felt bad for my son. I tried every cream you can think of and nothing worked. Then I switched diapers to the Pampers Pure. Within two days the rash went away. What a relief. I thought maybe the rash was because he was a newborn and pooped frequently so when he was about two months old, I tried some Honest Company diapers I had on hand again. Rash came back after three diaper changes. Huggies didn't get it to go away nor did a German brand (we currently live in Germany). I went on base and bought some Pampers Pure after trying those other brands and it went away again.\n\nGuess my little guy's bottom knows what is best! Thank you Pampers Pure. I will highly recommend them to everyone.", "With all the harmful chemicals and toxins in manufacturing these days, my wife and I looked for organic and safer products.

It's all about the $$$$. We would love to have used other organic brands but at the time of our research we saw many bad reviews for the other organic brands (e.g. leaks).\n\nWhen our baby started sleeping through the night (starting at around 4 months), we used sposie pads in addition to this diaper.

This still happens a little with the Pampers Pure, but not nearly as much. Perhaps other disposable brands would better fit his skinny thighs, but I like that these are reasonably less terrible than the usual diapers. I know there other brands like Honest and Seventh Generation we could buy, but we\u2019re gutting it out with what we have. Between these and the smallest cloth diapers in our stash, our baby should manage to soil himself or us only minimally before he grows into (and even out of) the whole stash. I\u2019ll tell you what, though: I\u2019m going to miss the yellow/blue strip telling you at a glance whether a diaper is wet.", "The diapers themselves are great and I recommend them.. very soft and lightweight while still being very absorbent. This review is about the subscribe and save program through amazon.\n\nThe photo shows what it looked like as soon as I opened it - now I know some people won\u2019t care, but it bothers me that the package was ripped open and diapers were just thrown on top to get the proper count. I get it if pampers doesn\u2019t make a 92 count, but the listing should say this. I buy the pure because my son has a skin condition that seems to be exacerbated by regular diapers, so it just bugged me that the sealed package was torn open and it looked like the diapers thrown in were handled and exposed to who knows what allergens in their warehouse. Now, I used to work for a company with a warehouse where I would do inventory, and I know just how dusty and dirty a warehouse can be.\n\nRegardless, I was willing to look past it and maybe just not use those diapers, but then I realized they sent me size 2 instead of size 3. I know this was just human error, but I decided to immediately cancel the subscribe and save as I really don\u2019t want to risk going through the hassle of having to return next month\u2019s order if the same issue occurs.\n\nConsidering this was my very first delivery through the subscribe and save program, it seems likely this could happen again and is not worth the trouble. Just wanted to give a heads up to any other moms out there who may have little ones with skin conditions/allergies or anyone who, like me, doesn\u2019t have time for returns when I have a 6 month old to care for!\n\nBottom line, I love these diapers and the quality/fit is perfect for my little man, and he seems very comfortable in them, so if you\u2019re considering trying them, I highly recommend the diapers themselves.

My oldest was sensitive to the chlorine used in diapers, and I had to use obscure and hard to find brands. I love that these are Pampers, without the smell. (to me, all Pampers starting at size 2 have the \"Pampers smell\" that i cannot stand). Before, I never bought Pampers because starting at size 2, they irritated my kid's skin, and smelled weird. Now, with Pampers Pure, I feel great about using a quality brand, they don't smell, and they don't irritate my baby's skin. And the patterns are subtle and pretty. They are expensive, but for me they are worth it. Great job, Pampers!", "We love the Pampers PURE collection! We use the diapers and the wipes as well. Love the line that indicates baby is wet.

In the meantime, we have him in Honest size 1 until he grows into the Pampers PURE size 1.", "I\u2019ve always used natural diapers because I hate putting strongly and very artificially scented products on my baby. The problem is that a lot of natural diapers leak more. I switched to these after too many leaky diapers from our previous brand. We have not had any leaks and I love that they are not scented. Also, my daughter has sensitive skin, and we have had no issues with rashes. This is all I use now!", "Yes, diapers are diapers. But these diapers are a little different in that they're absorbent but I also feel like they are better for my baby\u2019s delicate skin than others.\nWe were religiously using swaddlers and while they were great we had a rash every now and then.

We were gifted another brand (Luvs) and have also tried the swaddles but they were no comparison to these. These don\u2019t leak over night either like the other brands.

They are the best and worth the extra money.", "Recomende", "We were Pampers Pure loyalists for the beginning of our daughter's life (PP sizes Newborn-1). They're fragrance free and supremely soft, protecting her delicate, eczema prone skin. However, something odd happened once we hit size 2- the quality didn't seem quite the same and the diaper tabs began pulling off the diapers with a concerning frequency. At ~$0.34 per diaper, we were wasting several dollars a box in unusable diapers. Looking for an alternative that wouldn't sacrifice quality, we settled on Target's Cloud Island brand. At ~$0.23 per diaper, they're a steal compared to Pampers Pure and the quality is comparable if not even a nudge better. No more disappearing tabs, no leaks, no irritation. Pampers Pure were great diapers for us until they weren't, but with the quality and cost savings I've found in Cloud Island, I won't be giving them another chance.", "These work really well. My baby is 2 months and we\u2019ve tried honest and Huggies and they just don\u2019t compare to these. I like that these keep in all the mess. I\u2019ve found that they only leaked on one occasion when we didn\u2019t put the diaper on good enough. I\u2019ve not had accidents since. It also does not leave any fibers on my baby\u2019s skin like some other diapers do.", "Softer than Honest Company, just as absorbent or more. I like the blue wetness indicator line. I wish they were biodegradable and/or cheaper, but you can\u2019t have everything! I am pretty picky about smells/chemicals around my babe, and don\u2019t notice a smell except if I stick my nose right up to the diaper.

It's good to see that Pampers is getting on board with a \"cleaner\" product. However, my sweet little baby has pretty chunky thighs, so these were tight.

These are NOT replacement lights for when your 60w garage light bulb goes out. You can do that if you want, but please understand, this isn't a drop in replacement for your standard garage light.\n\nThis is a HIGH BAY light. For those who don't know what a high-bay is (and there is nothing wrong with not knowing), it is a light that is designed to be hung up VERY HIGH in a WAREHOUSE setting, along with a lot of other similar lights. The idea is that you can hang these VERY BRIGHT, relatively low wattage/power lights in a warehouse and still get good lighting.\n\nSO... if you are putting this in your garage, expect a few caveats. First, it isn't going to be a plug and play install. I do agree with Fuzzbean that some of these come with a standard 120v plug to make it easy, and I agree that I would prefer that this also come with that option, but I cannot see knocking it a star for that.\n\nAlso, these are going to be BRIGHT, uncomfortably bright with lots of glare IF YOU MOUNT THEM LOW. That's why they are called HIGH BAY lights. You gotta expect that with a high bay light.\n\nPlease don't think that I am suggesting you cannot use these in a garage, just the opposite. I am doing that very thing. They are AWESOME for a garage or shop that is lacking in light. I have spent a great deal of time and money trying to get enough light in my under-engineered garage and these high-bay lights do a wonderful job of giving me the light I am wanting and needing without running huge current draws or throwing breakers. You just have to be prepared to do a little wiring and/or screening to dampen the glare.\n\nWhen you consider what this is designed for, the Lithonia Lighting 12L 40K 80CRI WH Jebl Led Economical Round Bay Light, 12, 000 Lumens, 4000K, 80 CRI light is outstanding, The 80 CRI by the way, is a measure of the QUALITY of the light and 80 is not bad for a warehouse setting. The lumens is 12,000 which is insane compared to the typical 300-450 lumens a normal light bulb puts out. The 4,000k is the color temperature which is relatively cool, or blue - compared to the typical incandescent bulb's 2,700 orange light.\n\nSo feel free to hang one of these in your garage or shop, but expect a few differences and small changes you will need to make in order to deal with it. It is well worth it when you are working in the garage late at night and your eyes aren't tired because there is plenty of light to deal with in your shop.", "", "This high bay light can work for numerous situations. While these are more commonly used in warehouses and the like, you can easily get away with using this in a high ceiling garage, or for use in the aquarium. I've currently got a similar one set up for a planted freshwater aquarium. Just be warned, you'll need to either have this elevated pretty high above the aquarium, or use a dimmer switch. If not, you'll fry the plants. This bay light comes with wires to install the dimmer switch, so that is my recommendation when using it for aquariums. For my situation, I installed this one in my garage, so the dimming functionality wasn't a concern.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you'll need to wire it into the system, or install a plug. As it stands, this just comes with wires, that have already been twisted and soldered. Kind of nice, since I didn't have to do any real prep work. This isn't something you can pull out of the box, and plug into an outlet.\n\nIt does get a bit warm, but not so much that it should cause any issues. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how cool it was. I kept climbing up my ladder, to make sure it wasn't going to burn my house down. No concerns after repeated checks.\n\nI think some people may be surprised at the size and heft of this thing. Make sure it's secured properly, no matter the location. This thing is built to last too.\n\nOverall, it provides a very bright and consistent color. It's far better than what I had before, which consisted of a handful of incandescent bulbs.\n\nMy son is especially appreciative, because it's easier for him to park his car now.\n\nSuper happy with this light!", "So this is in a residential shop, truly high-bay in my case. Because it's up high (around 15 feet), I can't comment on a couple things - amount of heat it produces and also the light \"cone\" you might experience when installing it on a lower ceiling such as in a typical residential garage or work room.\n\nOn the plus side it is crazy bright, and perfect for my needs. It replaces a home-grown 4 socket Edison E26 bulb adapter which I'd installed 4 75 Watt-equivalent LED bulbs. The amount of light this Lithonia puts out is not even comparable - the Lithonia \"feels\" like 10 times more bright, but in all reality is about 4 times as bright per the lumen specifications.\n\nIt's working fine in sub-freezing temperatures so far, and is instant on as you'd expect.\n\nI personally prefer the 4000K white light, as the previous bulbs were 3000K or 2700K (i.e. warm white). I dislike anything above 5000K as it just looks distracting and blue or unnatural to my eye. 4000K is a great light spectrum to work by - such as in a shop or garage, in my opinion.\n\nThis is a quality product, well built, heavy, and with what I can only assume is a true commercial-grade LED driver. My personal experience with lots of early and cheaper LED products is that the driver is key. If you have super-cheap driver, there is no way you're getting even 5 years out of a light that will supposedly last 20. I've already had multiple LED lights go back after only a couple years - and it was the driver that failed, not the LEDs themselves. Sometimes you can replace it, most times if you're dealing with off-branded stuff - you can't.\n\nThis is a solid choice for a high-bay circular light, from a brand trusted by many electricians I can tell you that.", "This is working out very well for us in our woodworking shop. Housing is sturdy. The listing pic seems to show a frosted lens cover but the one we got was clear. It's likely just one of those things that can't be seen well in a photo, since it's all white. Just figured I'd mention in case it mattered to anyone.\n\nFor sizes and brightness like this, I don't think there are any user-replaceable LEDs out yet. Even so, this one is rated for a 17 year lifespan (used 8 hrs a day). It also has a 5 year limited warranty, and Lithonia Lighting is a long-term, reliable company.\n\nThis puts out a fantastic amount of light. If you use it on a ceiling that's too low, it's going to be kind of painfully stark. We have it mounted at 22' and it's just perfect.\n\nSince high bay lights used commercially are generally hardwired, this one doesn't have a plug. It's cable is plenty flexible and ready to wire right in. They do have models of other sizes that might be a little more homeowner-friendly, with a plug. Just search the brand name.\n\nI'll update if something hinky pops up, but so far this is just excellent for our needs.\n\nDon't forget to use the Smile.Amazon.com address - It's an Amazon program where many things you buy every day will generate a small donation from Amazon to the charity of your choice.

I have a two car garage with an open ceiling that looks up to the roofing, which peaks about ten feet farther up and is light in color (just pine boards). I have a few areas in the garage that are well lit, but the trouble has been that if you leave those areas, you're in blackness. I therefore set this light facing up to light up the roof, resulting in indirect lighting covering the entire garage. Another option that I considered was to use the built in dimming capability, add the appropriate LED dimmer switch, and face the unit down, dimming it to a reasonable brightness given its proximity to the workspace. I may give this a try in the future, but for now I'm content. The unit works perfectly, lights up the garage as if it's daytime, and appears well made and designed. It has two sets of wires, one the standard white/black/green, and the other a pair of dimming wires. The white/black/green can be connected directly to a plug and then the unit can simply be plugged in, or you can hardwire the entire fixture. The dimming wires need to go separately to the LED dimming control (which is not included in this package).", "I can't say enough about this light. But I will say that I have absolutely been blown away by it. We ordered this light to try because we are re doing our barn/horse stable and wanted to get away from the high energy lights that we currently had in there. We hung this light about 20 feet in the air, and it filled our entire barn with light (about 1500 sq ft). It does seem to warm up and get brighter after being on for a few minutes.\n\nMy boyfriend is an electrical contractor so wiring the light to be used was very easy, and the light came with everything that we needed to install it. the brightest of this light is just amazing. We have brought everyone out to see it (whether they cared to or not). I was skeptical of the price at first, but after seeing this light in action, its well worth it. It will take the place of 5 lights!", "I'm using this bay light to illuminate my workshop bay. It's definitely bright enough. I have the light hanging temporarily from the steel truss approximately 12' from the floor and slightly off-center. Because there are some shadows cast, I may need another unit to provide some fill.\n\nThese bay lights need to be hardwired. There's a separate cable for a 10v dimmer, which I need to research, since I may need to connect two units to one dimmer.\n\nThe light can be hung by its eyebolt or there's an optional mounting bracket. I used the eyebolt and a rope temporarily but that's not to code. Use something fireproof like a cable or chain. Odd that there is no safety cable.\n\nThe construction of this bay light is solid. You won't be disappointed by the quality. I wasn't.", "Die cast Aluminum, tempered glass , simple install. Extremely bright - everything you need in a light. It IS very bright and direct light, suitable for any location with very high ceilings. It also supports a separate dimming control. It mounts from either a threaded rod or the supplied ring.

If you attempt to use this as a workbench light or in a garage with a low ceiling, you will need to add the optional dimmer. It is very bright and designed to disperse the light it gives off over a long distance. However having said that, t makes a great workbench light if positioned properly and equipped with a dimmer. It comes with a pigtail wire so you will have to hard wire or add a plug. Same goes for the dimmer, only a pigtail is provided. As far as the light itself, it's pretty rugged and has a hefty feel to it. You definitely get the impression that this is a well made industrial item. The 4000k light is not too blue not too orange, a comfortable temperature that does not distort colors. A great light if you have the proper application.", "Heavyweight, bright lamp, with a big bolt on the back for hanging it. These are designed to be hung quite high in a warehouse.

It has the option to hook up a dimmer but that's not included. You need to be aware that the light is designed for a high bay area so it's designed to throw the light straight down instead of throwing the light outward. It does a great job of this. The light itself is well constructed. It is easy to install and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.", "I have a shop that is built like a barn. It has 12-foot high ceilings. These lights work really well. I can place them over an area that I want light focused on but also get enough light bleed from them that they add to the overall shop lighting.

I dropped it (see \"klutz\" statement, above) from waist-high. The slide stayed closed and the lid did not even come a little loose when it hit the hard floor.\n* The sliding thingy that covers the drink hole stays put.

I only use it for hot beverages so I'm afraid I can't speak to cold retention. I was concerned with heat loss out the top and there really is none. I always fill it with hot tap water to heat the metal prior to pouring my coffee in and I've learned this is a useful trick with any stainless mug.\n\nIt turns out I do not prefer the always open lid and would have given it 4 stars except that I knew what the lid was before purchasing and some others may not take issue with it. The lid fits very well with a nice seal and no leaking whatsoever (save what may slosh out the mouth hole when you're not extra careful). No strange odor or flavor comes from the lid and the stainless cup is easy to hand wash and sanitize daily, even for this busy mom. Your fingerprints will transfer to the outside because it's real and normal stainless steel.

I use it for both iced and hot beverages like iced teas and coffees, respectfully. Both stayed cold and warm for passed a couple of hours which is perfect for what I need.

First time with Honeywell product and don\u2019t know what took me so long. I hooked a hose up to my sump pump and I don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there. My house is new, only 2 1/2 years old but a dehumidifier is always a great idea. It\u2019s easy to move. I just sprayed my floor and just rolled it where I wanted.

I recommend putting furniture feet protectors under a couple of the wheels so it doesn't roll...eg: an uneven floor or the washer in spin cycle next to the platform.", "The compressor is extremely quiet. On low the fan is hardly noticeable . This unit immediately started pulling water from the air. I have a hose draining it to a sump hole. The water was pouring out like a faucet for the first day. Now it is doing a fast drip. I have the unit set at 40% which means it brings the humidity down to 35% before turning off the compressor. The compressor comes back on at 45% humidity.\n\nOne thing that doesn\u2019t seem right is the fan never stops running. It stays on after the humidity reaches 35% rather than shutting off after 3 minutes as specified in the manual.", "So far, I have to say that we are very impressed with the Honeywell 70 Pint Dehumidifier with the built in pump. A couple of years ago, we learned that we were having humidity problems in our home when conduit condensation literally melted through part of our basement ceiling. After three years with a different brand's loud, ugly model, we started looking for a better solution (aka not buying just anything as an emergency response). During our hunt, a work friend of mine recommended the Honeywell 70 Pint Dehumidifier with the built-in pump. I will be blunt, I didn\u2019t really get why we needed the pump but when my husband (an engineer) saw the product on Amazon, he told me to order it immediately since he thought it would fix all of our problems. Boy was he right!\nTypically, we have a dehumidifier running 24/7 as much as possible during the summer months \u2013 one built-in in the basement and one upstairs. After the ceiling incident, our A/C guy recommended we never let the humidity get above 50% or it would probably happen again. Even with their professionally installed dehumidifier in the basement, our upper floors would typically stay at 60% if we used nothing more, and the upstairs (noisy) one struggled to maintain 47 \u2013 50% humidity in our 2400 square foot home.\nAfter setting up the Honeywell 70 Pint Dehumidifier with the built in pump for a little over a day, we had something happen that baffled us \u2013 the dehumidifier was running with just the fan. We at first thought something was wrong until we looked at the unit and our home thermostat \u2013 our humidity was at 39%! This has literally never happened during the summer since we purchased our house. All of this within a 24 hour period! After a week of running in our home, the air quality in our home is even better, with me not needing some of my allergy medications (I work from home so that's mostly where my allergies trigger). It isn't an exaggeration to say it thoroughly beat our expectations.\nWhat I have to say is another major plus is the built in pump. Not having to constantly worry about emptying the bucket twice a day has been a major relief - the pump just drains through a line into our first floor bathroom sink. I want to say this happened about 3 to 4 times the first day (before it had lowered the upstairs humidity), and has dropped to 2-3 times a day after that. It activates for less than 30 seconds, but I won't lie, the unit is a bit loud for that time. However, compared to hauling and dumping the old one's bucket - and hoping it doesn't spill while moving through the house - it's just so much better. The only \"drawback\" is that I no longer have a bucket of water ready for watering my deck flowers \u2013 darn!\nSetting up the drain line for the pump was the hardest part of the entire setup - quite literally screwing the hose to the back. Empty the box and the parts in the bucket, position, and go (5 minutes or less for everything).\n\nOverall, the Honeywell 70 Pint Dehumidifier with the built in pump might be the best $350 we ever spent on our home and health. It is stylish, performs above our expectations, and runs fairly quiet compared to our old dehumidifier (which is impressive when we moved it to our two story open hallway with echo issues). After turning off our other units, we're saving time and money, AND enjoying peace of mind when we travel, knowing humidity will no longer be an issue in our home!", "Works great, but too noisy for bedroom", "I bought 2 of these I have had them for a month and they work great", "It really sucks the moisture out of our little guest house that is not used very often, so it can smell moldy. This machine really sucked out the smell along with the moisture. A real work horse. I would buy again.", "Arrived quickly. Had it for @ 5 weeks now. Plugged it in, hooked up a standard garden hose and it's been keeping my basement dry since. It's not silent, but not noticeably noisy either. But it is in my basement. I would definitely recommend it for now. Only time will tell if it was a good move. Great so far.", "This is a good investment in a dry basement. Dampness does a number on walls and stuff stored down there. This unit does a great job keeping things dry.", "I have one of these in my bedroom and one in the kitchen. W\nbefore using the dehumidifier in the kitchen I was\n\nI was trying to get\n\nI was trying to paint my kitchen & the humidity was 78% before I used the dehumidifier. it brought it down to 33 in no time. note ~ paint will not dry with the humidity so high.", "This dehumidifier replaced a larger witty the same capacity. Works great, and decently quiet. I wish it could be almost silent, but dehumidification doesn't work that way. I would buy this unit again, no questions. Easy to set up, and easy to use with the included hose.", "The dehumidifier itself seems to work as well as any other modern unit, and it makes less noise, and less objectionable noise, than most.\n\nHowever, it has a nearly fatal flaw: the continuous-drain feature, when used with the included hose, doesn't work at all. The instructions insist that you must use the included hose; if you do, the unit will not drain, and the tank will fill up and shut the machine off within a day.\n\nLike many modern dehumidifiers, this unit uses an internal drainage channel that \"automatically\" routes water to the hose fitting when you remove a stopper. This relies on gravity and the flow of water. It seems that the included \"hose\"\u2014an adapter that transitions from a standard 11.5NH garden hose fitting to a small, rigid plastic tube\u2014has an inner diameter that's too small to reliably drain the unit before condensate flows into the tank. Tilting the unit doesn't reliably fix this problem. Also, the included hose, being very stiff, is difficult to route. It really wants to rise higher than the fitting on the dehumidifier, which would make the problem worse.\n\nThis problem can be overcome by using a standard aftermarket drain hose with an 11.5NH garden-hose fitting, or a length of cut-off garden hose or washing-machine supply hose with the same fitting. The larger diameter of these hoses seems to make the difference.\n\nIt's a shame that manufacturers like Honeywell's ODM design dehumidifiers with these overcomplicated and unreliable drainage mechanisms, in the name of an \"easy to access\" drain port. Worse is insisting that consumers use an included hose that is inferior and inadequate.", "This unit is Consumer Reports top pick. I was hoping for a little less noise since CR rated it fairly quiet but I guess that was relative to other dehumidifiers tested. There is a bit of compressor noise when it is running and as the water catch bin fills the cabinet gets very buzzy as the weight of the water in the bin builds up - it is pretty loud as the bin gets more and more full. This unit is rated at 70 pints per day of dehumidifying and it definitely lives up to that. I don't have any drain nearby so I have to empty the water bid four times a day and while I'm sleeping it fills up and shuts off so it really would be five times a day.\n\nOnly other negative is that it puts out almost 100 degree (F) air so it does warm the area that it is running in a fair amount.\n\nThey make a wi-fi enabled version of this dehumidifier as well if you want a little more tech and remote control ability.", "I\u2019ve only had it for a week so far, this is my second. My first was from another company. I\u2019m running both of them at the same time. This one, seems to be faster for pulling out water. But here\u2019s the problem the tank that holds the water does not come out easily. It is relatively cheap plastic and it doesn\u2019t pull out easily so it almost gets stuck. Keep in mind I have one also I tend to go from a different company that is easy to pull out", "Arrived before estimate. Opened and removed dehumidifier to set up and noticed one\nOf the four wheels was broken off from the bottom. Apparently, someone handling this item slammed the box down hard.\nUsed a zip tie and reattached the wheel.\nSet up was fairly easy. The external drain hose is small and shorter than it should be.\nTurned on and started to dehumidify immediately. Has worked for a week so far with no problems. Went with this brand and model because CR recommended it.\nOnly time will tell if the premium price was justified.", "I bought the Honeywell model TP70WKN humidifier largely because it carries the Honeywell name brand and comes with a 5-year warranty on the compressor. I had hoped for a far better experience. When the compressor is on, which has been almost constantly during the week I\u2019ve owned the unit, the noise measures 73 dBA at three feet. It includes a loud rattling sound and intermittent buzzing that can be heard in most rooms of my home, either through floor vibrations or air transmission through the HVAC system. The source of the rattling noise seems to be around the spacing between the plastic water bucket and the main unit, as well as the component connections inside the bucket itself. The fan noise itself is tolerable, but the compressor has run almost constantly during the week that I\u2019ve owned the unit, so there\u2019s little occasion to hear only the fan, even though the ambient humidity level has never exceeded about 65%.\n\nUsing a permanent drain, which I prefer over allowing the water to collect in the bucket, the extension tubing that comes with the unit is only 3.28 feet (39.4 inches) long, which happens to be several inches too short to reach my basement drain. It is also quite flimsy and subject to curling, which requires that it be tied or taped down to be functional. There are no instructions to indicate that the tubing should be pulled away from the screw-on portion when connecting it to the drain outlet on the back, and then reattached, as opposed to twisting both the tubing and screw-on portion while connecting it to the drain. In addition to a thinner rubber gasket, the screw-on portion contains a thick rubber gasket that seems to have no purpose, since it must be removed before a connection can be made to the back of the unit. Even then, making the connection is difficult because the threads on the tubing do not seem to be a perfect match to the threads on the drain outlet. I was able to rig a connection with an adapter and plastic tubing that I purchased locally, as that seems to be the only way to achieve permanent drainage.\n\nThere\u2019s a larger picture to be understood when it comes to buying portable dehumidifiers. I've owned three Frigidaire dehumidifiers in the past six years, including one unit replaced under warranty. I suspect that the replacement unit was refurbished, as it stopped working after about a year. I\u2019ve junked all three units at my local recycling center because of compressor failures and out of disgust with Frigidaire\u2019s policies for replacement under warranty. Those units were, and still are, reviewed positively online. In my opinion, if Frigidaire units are the best on the market, there\u2019s simply no such thing as a portable dehumidifier that functions well for more than about two years. The manager of my local appliance-repair shop told me that there is essentially no way to fix compressor problems, so these units have to be replaced, typically because of corroded coils that result in lost refrigerant.\n\nI strongly recommend against purchasing this Honeywell dehumidifier, and I personally will never again buy another Honeywell product. It seems better designed as a noise generator than a dehumidifier, and it seems to run constantly. As recommended by Honeywell when I registered the unit, I contacted its customer service department by email for advice on what might be done to address my concerns with the unit, but I did not hear back, so I am returning the unit for a refund. I am not sure what to buy as a replacement, but until a company is able to manufacture a unit that lasts for more than a couple of years, my basement is likely to remain humid. The bottom line: The Honeywell TP70WKN dehumidifier is a terrible choice. Be skeptical of YouTube and other internet video reviews of these units, and good luck finding one that functions well over the long term, as the key is reliability!", "Not happy that it failed but supplier was professional in substituting another.", "The reservoir is a little flimsy and pours clumsily. I pour the water into my rain barrel...or try to...most of it goes in but it pour out of the reservoir in 2 places, so only most goes in the rain barrel. 3 out of 4 times when I remove the reservoir water pours out of the unit into a small depression under where the reservoir is. I have to keep a towel handy to soak up the 1/4 cup of water. Other than that the unit works well. Although it isn't really loud I wish it had a quiet mode.", "This is the latest in a long parade of sub-$300 dehumdifiers for my basement storage area. Last three units were Frigidaire, and Honeywell before that, using direct drain to a floor drain. The sealed units (compressor) have failed within two years despite the storage area being well within square footage and ambient temperature specs for these units.\n\nI've had this latest unit running about three weeks now. It does dehumidify well; it dropped humidity from around 55% to 45% in just a day. We are beginning heating season so ambient humidity is lower now, as a result the unit isn't running full time.\n\nPrevious reviewer mentioned difficulty getting a standard garden hose fitting to connect to the direct drain, but I didn't have any problem with that. The direct drain coupling is permanently mounted to the unit, so be careful connecting drain hose to plastic threads--I don't think the drain fitting can be replaced on this unit. Advantage here to Frigidaire--their units had a screw-in fitting to connect the drain hose, so you could order a new one if the threads get messed up.\n\nMy two biggest issues: This unit is noisy when compressor is running. While there is a slow fan speed, everything seems to kick into overdrive when compressor is on. Since this is in a separate room from our finished basement space, it's not a big issue, but if installing this in a living area, beware.\n\nSecond big issue is the humidistat/humidity guage. I will say the unit has a nice backlit display on the front of the unit so you can see the current humidity reading from across the room. This is in addition to the usual display on the top control panel. However, the guage on mine reads about 7-8% higher than the actual room humidity, as measured by an accurate digital humidity guage. This means I have to keep the setting at 50% or 55% to get near my target humidity of 45%. As a result the actual room humidity is either 43% or 48%. Not a big deal, but no other unit I've had has been off by more than 1 to 2%\n\nOtherwise I'm pleased with the dehumidifier. Remains to be seen if I get more than 2 years out of it.\n\nMy biggest issue with", "Dehumidifier is working as expected.\n\nI don't care for the design pump on this unit. The pump only starts to pump water out of the bucket when the bucket is almost full. I prefer the pump design that never lets the bucket fill with any water.\n\nThe 4 caster wheels are cheap. Honeywell installed the casters before shipping and two of the 4 casters broke in transit. I did not return the unit as I need a dehumidifier. Honeywell should leave the casters off the unit and have the user install them."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DPWNDWR", "title": "Levi's Men's 501 Original Fit Jean Pants, -Two Face, 32W x 29L", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01RmK+J4pJL._AC_.gif", "ratings": "4 ratings", "description": "Levi's Men's 501 Original Fit Jean Pants, -Two Face, 32W x 29L", "reviews": ["Husband is 73 years old. 501\u2019s are his favorite jean.

It sometimes takes a minute for the material to start absorbing. So, if you are cleaning a spill, you will likely be pushing fluid around before you start soaking it up. I usually just drop the cloth on top of fluid and press the cloth until absorption starts. Likewise, when trying to wet the cloth, I have to squeeze it several times in water before the liquid penetrates. It is important to remember that the use of fabric softeners, and some detergents, can affect the cloths\u2019 ability to absorb. I add vinegar instead of detergent and wash them on the \u201chot\u201d setting.\n\nHowever, these are perfect for cleaning. The size is just right.

The trick is to let it sit a few minutes then press into the clothing to soak up stains (don't scrub, just allow the stain to be soaked into cloth).

I am so skeptical and these demos are always \"fixed\" to show the product is better than it really is. This was a decent price lightning deal on Amazon so purchased. I would NOT pay full price. This did remove stains from clothing, and food on counters. As far as clothing, other brands you can buy at Walmart work just as well and are cheaper. In the demo I was advised this would work well on Glass Cooking tops so I used this. I did notice anything spectacular as to it working better. Soft scrub works better. If I compare this to any of the \"orange\" cleaners (even from the dollar tree) I see no difference at all in kitchen cleaning. This product might have some great uses I have not tried I am sure. Goo gone works just as well for sticky stuff and well, glues. This works also, but not sure it really is worth the hype or expense.

The Luvs still did their job overnight to the best of their ability, but there for several days we were waking up to leaks, busted diapers, and wet jammies.

These are fine but not the best, it's whatever for the price.", "I purchased these diapers after searching online for \u201cbest overnight diapers\u201d and seeing them in a list of highly rated leakproof options. After opening the first of two boxes, I was disappointed by a few things I didn\u2019t expect:\n\n\u2022 The back of the diaper is not elasticized, so the diaper has to be closed very tightly to keep the back close to baby\u2019s skin.\n\u2022 The front tabs do not extend to cover the sides, so I ended up having to really pull the Velcro tabs to get a good fit. This meant that on my daughter, the tabs were sitting really snugly on her thighs, and I worried they were cutting into her skin.\n\u2022 The diapers are truly paper thin, although this did not seem to affect absorbency.\n\u2022 The material is rough, unlike other brands which are softer with more cushion.\n\nI was indifferent to the scent, although it\u2019s definitely stronger than one might expect for a product intended for babies. Not entirely sure if this is healthy for a newborn.\n\nIn terms of absorbency, these held up shockingly well. We have had no leaks in the last 3 days of trying them out, and several diapers were very heavy when I changed her, so I think that\u2019s a good indicator of how much they absorbed.\n\nMy first issue with these diapers is that they really are too rough for my one month old, especially considering how snugly I need to close them since there\u2019s no elastic back and the front tabs are so short. I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s comfortable to have a tight, papery diaper on her delicate skin.\n\nThe dealbreaker here was that the flat back that totally fails to keep her poop inside (which is after all the actual point of a diaper). The first (and last) time she pooped in one, it went all the way up her back and into her shirt. I\u2019m now using these diapers strictly during the day, and only when I am pretty sure she won\u2019t be pooping again. For the poop issue alone, I would not use these overnight, which was why I bought them in the first place. Despite the low price, I\u2019ll be sticking with Huggies for the fit or Pampers for the softness.\n\nAs an aside, I question whether or not the 5-star reviews on this item are legit. When I sorted for the most recent 5-stars reviews, they were all just a few lines long and incredibly vague. I\u2019m just not convinced such a mediocre item could have so many satisfied customers.", "They are a good value. I will say they are not very good for overnight diapers. They do tend to leak if you do not change the diapers overnight. And when they get too full it\u2019s almost like the diapers start to dissolve and get these white balls.

They fit nicely around her thighs. Easy to pull tabs. They do pull off to readjust the band. Luvs are the most inexpensive brands. I didn't buy them because they weren't as soft and they didn't have the wet indicator line. I was so happy to see the indicator on the front and back. My only complaint is I wish they were as soft as Huggies or pampers. If you are on a budget, these are great diaper. I recommend these and will continue to buy.", "Love them!", "I'm using Luvs for both my kids, ages 2 1/2 and 9 months. As far as quality goes, they're acceptable to very good, depending on when I use them. They're perfectly fine for changing every 2-3 hours during the day, and I have never had issues with rashes. I've had issues with overnight leaks with every single diaper I've tried, including the ones specifically marked as \"overnight,\" and these are no different--occasionally one or both of the kids will wake up with some leakage.\n\nThe recommended weights for size 3 and up, however, seem way off to me. I had to switch Kid #1 to size 5 when he hit about 19 pounds (the recommended size is 27+ lbs). Kid #2 moved to size 5 at 17 lbs. Neither of them are big babies or toddlers--one is on the smaller side, the other right in the middle of the BMI chart.

That ended when loves were cheaper and worked almost just as good. With child #2 & #3 it was loves all the way. Now that my daughter is having my new grandbaby girl loves continues to be the go to diaper.\n\nThe cost vs usability is unbeatable. These are cost effective diapers and work almost as well as the high $ brands. The difference in cost in my opinion is not worth the leak protetion, durability or ease of use. Loves has great protection they will last with your kids running around playing until changing is needed. Over night protection is just as good as well.\n\nDont waste your hard earned, tight budget money for diapers that are way over priced when loves are just as effective. These will always be my family's #1 choice based on cost and effectiveness.\n3 generations and growing with loves diapers catching all the crap along the way.", "Good diapers can\u2019t complain for the price although pull ups are better for potty training.

My basic opinion is \u201cgood enough\u201d and \u201cgood value\u201d.\nThey are sort of on par with many store brands sold in various places.\nI still think pampers and huggies are technically a better diaper In build, but for your money these are a much better value. (They pee on them and you throw them away after all).\nThese are my go to if I don\u2019t see anything else for a deal or on a good sale.\nAnd I guess as the commercial says- I have multiple kids in diapers which accounts for my slightly blas\u00e9 attitude towards brand loyalty in diapers.

There is no way in hell I am taking this thing to a dry cleaner every time it needs a wash. I attempted to wash it at my house on the gentle cycle based on a suggestion I saw when reading the reviews.. And I almost broke my machine. The reason why this bedskirt is so plush is because it has a delicate fluffy inner filling which is why they want you to dry clean only. Also because of the filling, when it\u2019s wet it becomes very heavy. I went to pull it out of my machine to see an error message on the screen and it was absolutely soaking wet. I was as you can imagine, I was very upset and afraid that I ruined it. I ended up throwing it into a garbage bag and bringing it to the local laundry matt to re-wash in a bigger and more powerful machine.. And an error message came up on that one too ! \ud83d\ude02 but I was still able to complete my wash. I was standing there cringing as I watched this washing machine fling my beautiful bedskirt around so violently but I just remained hopeful. When I took it out, I was happy to discover that it had been spun almost completely dry. I anxiously felt around to see if the inside was totally balled up and wrecked, but it wasn\u2019t ! The inner filling was A-ok. I then transferred it to the drier and let it dry for about 12 minutes and it was good to go. When I got home and put it back on my bed I was so relieved that I didn\u2019t wreck it. My bedskirt survived and it looks just the same as before.

It comes with a natural looking slightly crepe like wrinkle. Came nicely packaged and very fast. I was over the moon when I opened it up and I also had no idea it came with matching pillow cases. The skirt is very long -prob more than an actual bed skirt but it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. It\u2019s great for higher beds like some I\u2019ve had that have a taller frame or the temperpedic mattresses that are sort of thicker than normal.

It is subtly feminine and romantic without being cutesy or cheesey or childish. No fussy frills and ruffles mess.\n\n\u2022 I fits my bed perfectly, and the drop ruffle (single only, not multiple/frilly) is the perfect length. My mattress is 12\" thick and my bed frame is about 13\" high, so there is a nice pooling of material on the floor.\n\n\u2022 The material is very soft and at first I was concerned the coverlet would be too sheer (I have sheets in varying shades of blue and patterns) but the top is much thicker than the sides, and the dark blue sheet is not noticeable on the sides or top.\n\n\u2022 There are some threads here and there, but overall the construction is good. I feel confident this will last awhile.\n\n\u2022 The only concern I have is keeping the white white. I was looking at a different coverlet when shopping for something like this and that was described as \"delicate material/dry clean only\" which was a pass for me.

I am using it on an adjustable base which is not good for a dust ruffle. Great alternative to cover up the bedframe when made up. Very lightweight and virtually wrinkle-free.

Has stitches in the top to help keep the batting in place, see photo. Not going to have it dry cleaned as that would cost more than the spread. But also wanted it clean to put on my bed. I got the king size, and the skirt lays just at the floor, which is nice. Washed it on gentle, and dried on low. Did good in the washer and dryer.", "I am very happy with this lovely bedspread.

Well, I was surprised, pleasantly, how it came out. Not too wrinkled & did not need any ironing. Looks shabby chic with a little wrinkling (naturally looks like that) and washed up nice. Washed on delicate, cold water & dryed on low. The bedspread has a little fill in it too. Very cozy & soft!! I bought queen size for a full size bed because I wanted the sides to come all the way down so I would/nt need a bed skirt. Looks beautiful in my guest bedroom!", "So much bang for your buck! Going to buy in every color and style \ud83e\udee3 The softness is unreal!!! I never want to get out of bed.

I had a comforter and bed skirt on the bed, but the bottom of the mattress always showed a little. This bedspread with the 30\" drop ruffle is absolutely perfect. It not only covers the entire bed, but it also reaches the floor on all three sides as you can see. The pillow shams fit king-sized pillows, and the result is gorgeous! I would highly recommend and might actually get two more in queen-size for my spare room beds. Fast shipping, too.", "Love, love this bed cover. Fits perfectly for a queen size bed. Always looks great!!!", "It is light weight, I use it on my QUEEN bed, it came very wrinkled but it is improving. Very soft . I am happy with my purchase.", "Such a beautiful light weight bedspread/comforter. The material is supposed to have some wrinkles. It is a bedspread that acts like a comforter. I live in Florida, so it is the perfect weight. For cooler months, I can place a blanket underneath for added warmth. Such a classic and elegant style. I have an elevated queen sized rice bed. I ordered king size to ensure it would touch the floor. This is one of the best purchases I have ever made. I even ordered one for my mother.

We tried Pampers, Huggies, Luvs, and so many more, but this brand is the only one that doesn't cause the chemical burn. That's not to say that all other diapers are crap, because I believe it all depends on the child and how their own little bodies react to the different types of materials in diapers. Other than that, I love the leg bands are really nice and secure, keeping her messes inside! And the prints are just precious! I wish more diaper manufacturers would do different prints, we especially love the cheetah print!", "Have tried several different diapers & variations within brands, Honest Company is definitely my husband and I favorite.\n\nWe were constantly dealing with blowouts and I was becoming frustrated having to wash poop out of her clothes several times a day.

Especially compared to Hello Bello.\nFeel nice and thick, a little thicker than Pampers Pure.\nSuper cute to look at.\nTabs stick down securely on waist\nLeg room is nice\nHaven't had any issues with blowouts\n\nCon- they are pricey. But with Amazon's diaper discount (from their registry offer) and/or the subscribe & save it puts them at around the same price as Pampers Pure.\nNo wetness indicator. I've seen in commercials that they were maybe adding it? But we haven't received any with it. That isn't a big deal to me but definitely worth mentioning.\n\nSize information:\nThey do run a little smaller than Pampers. My lo is 7.5 months old around 22lbs and we were wearing a size 3 in Pampers Pure. When we bought these in size 3, they were right on the edge of being snug. The waist fit fine but around her legs were getting a little tight. Now maybe if she wasn't starting to move around as much, trying to crawl ect it might have been OK but next time I got a size 4 and they fit great with plenty of wiggle room. The size chart says both sizes will fit & they do. But the 4 is more suitable if your lo is becoming more active. Or if your lo is like mine & she's got some thick thighs lol.\n\nDefinitely recommend especially for breastfeeding moms where baby's poo tends to have so much variety.

After every nap leaked. My husband was sitting on the couch with our son on his lap and all of a sudden he started yelling I\u2019m being peed on (diaper was on and dry fresh one and it leaked out the side). They leak out the sides and the back when sleeping. For how expensive these are I should not have daily leaks. My son is 21 lbs and I ordered size 4 so I\u2019m in the right size for him. The tie die ones weren\u2019t as back as the cactus ones. The cactus print is the worst one of all. Very upset with the product.\nOne diaper (yes it only happened on one it\u2019s weird) my son got a rash from. And not from the diaper absorbent part from on the sides of his butt like where the tabs go around to attach.

I order a specific print and get a different printed one that isn\u2019t the updated honest diapers. The updated diapers fit differently to the old ones (would have to size up) and the diaper itself is textured differently.

With adjustable shelving and cord management feature, this console will make a useful piece to your home.", "reviews": ["Bought this unit to replace an old Ikea cabinet that didn't have as much shelf space. I'm not sure if the other reviews on this product come from a time when the price was much, much lower, or the build quality was much, much higher, but honestly the $300 Ikea cabinet we had was better than this thing.\n\nFor starters\u2014the unit is not 28\" tall. It's just over 26\". We actually counted on that, because 26\" was the height we wanted. Other websites like Overstock and Wayfair had identical cabinets with different names with the correct height listed, so we chanced it.\n\nWe obviously knew we weren't getting a $2k media console for ~$450+tax, but we at least assumed we'd be getting something of some kind of quality, whether it was ease-of-build, sturdiness, or something that looked nice at a distance, or at least up close. We got none of those.\n\nThe unit was packaged well, every piece was intact with no structural damage, even after getting tossed around by Amazon. Still, the finish on the top of the unit had some gnarly gashes on it right out of the box. The bottom shelf (the one that would never be visible to anyone) was pristine. It seems dumb now, but at the time but we paid about $120 extra for the darker brown finish than what we would have paid for the lighter brown finish.\n\nAs far as building the thing, nothing fit exactly. Other reviews are right, the directions are really not clear on what's the front or rear of each piece. Having read all those warnings, we scrutinized each piece before putting it into place, it was like a \"spot the difference between these two pictures\" exercise, with us looking for the tiniest speck on the instructions that represented an asymmetry to indicate a proper orientation. We managed to make it through without having to deconstruct and flip any pieces, but there were absolutely some moments were we had something in place and flipped it after noticing the instructions had ONE tiny hole represented where ours didn't.\n\nAll of the cheap metal needed to be bent into place, exposing gaps elsewhere. Tightening stuff and actually putting it together went pretty smoothly, until we got to the rear panels. It was impossible to get proper leverage on any of the screws due to bad threading, cheap screws and poor design. The doors were a nightmare, see the tips I wrote below.\n\nThe magnets designed to hold the doors closed are the cheapest craft store parts I've ever come across, and the screws to hold them in place are too wide for the holes they're meant for. They barely have enough strength to hold the doors shut.\n\nOne of the metal cage doors had handle holes drilled a few mm off, which is not just an annoying thing to look at\u2014you can't fully close the door with it off center like that, and there's nothing you can do to fix it, besides order a replacement part, which...see below.\n\nThis build wasn't impossible like a lot of the reviews say, but there are a few tips for putting it together that I wish I'd had:\n-Look CLOSELY at the directions. The details on what makes the front of a part the front are extremely subtle, but they are depicted in the illustrations. It's usually something as small as a little dot on one side of the piece in the picture, which represents a hole that is super easy to miss in real life.\n-The rear panels can be flipped upside down if desired. This is particularly useful if you're going to be running cables from something in an upper or lower shelf. It's extremely silly that there aren't two ports per panel, because you essentially lose the ability to run cables to one shelf in the outer left or right with just a single port.\n-For the phillips head screws, use the largest driver head you can find. We thought it could be done with simply a phillips driver that fit securely, but the resistance offered by the poorly drilled holes made it impossible to tighten them. Until I switched to a larger bit, it was impossible to turn the screws in the holes, and even after getting a better tool, it required much, much more elbow-grease than I've ever had to exert when putting together something with pre-drilled holes. Maybe a powerful drill would have been better, but with the rear panels, there was no way to tighten the screws with that amount of resistance at that angle, regardless of what tool you use.\n\nThe only reason it wasn't returned immediately was because repacking this thing would have been a nightmare, and it would feel terrible if it was one of those situations where Amazon says \"ok we'll refund you, just throw it out.\"\n\nI contacted the manufacturer over five days ago about all of the above, and was instructed to file a part replacement request. Which I did, but then heard nothing back. I'm not even sure what parts I would request replacements for? Obviously the door with the incorrectly drilled holes, but are the rest of the screw holes supposed to be this poorly drilled? Are there different screws that should have come with this thing? Is there a better fitting door magnet? Would they replace the top of the unit that came with all those finish issues? Do I need new metal frame pieces because of how crooked the doors are no matter how many adjustments I make?\n\nI would have rather paid 2-3x the amount we paid for this unit for something of actual quality. For the price, you can absolutely find something better, and if you're looking for a product this bad you can definitely find something equivalent for less money.\n\nIf there was a simple way to return this piece of trash, I would have done it. Skip this thing and buy something with a price that matches its quality.", "For the money, it\u2019s not bad. No trouble putting this together by myself. Over all it serves its purpose well. It\u2019s a good match with other furniture we have but it\u2019s not solid wood. The finish is a photograph of a wood pattern. That means a slight scratch or rub will really show. I would not recommend this if you have toddlers and want to keep this piece in good shape. If you\u2019re careful, it will last as long as you want it too.", "So I have a mixed review, but read on. First and foremost, I very much appreciated how carefully each part was stickered so that it was easy to know which part was which....each solid piece is labeled clearly and the screws come in their own labeled bag...so well done there.\n\nThe first few steps are SUPER EASY, and I thought \"well this is going really great\" until I got to the step where you attached the metal panels to the back of the piece. You have to contort your body to screw these tiny black metal screws into the black metal frame in an inside piece which makes the whole thing really dark and hard to see. It is an extremely difficult step, and I found that the holes in the metal frame were not well drilled. So after several minutes of frustration, cursing, contemplating my humanity and almost losing a relationship, I got out the power drill with a Philips head attachment and just forced them in - that worked.\n\nThe last major step, attaching the doors, was fairly easy but it definitely takes two people - one to hold the doors and one to attach them.\n\nOverall, very happy with this piece and very pleased with the labeling and directions, but that one step is a killer. So be prepared with copious amounts of alcohol, a flashlight, and a drill.", "In love with this furniture, it gives my house a better look", "Ok....you ever hear the saying \"start with the end in mind\"? You may as well start from the end of the manual and work yourself forward...Just when i though i was almost done building it i realized that the instructions/pics left something out that required me to disassemble the unit almost entirely in order to flip shelves over and swap sides. I had to do this twice so what should have probably taken an hour to built took twice as long.\n\nThat being said I (grudgingly due to the aforementioned issues) absolutely love this console for my game room. It fits all my consoles and some peripherals and it keeps everything looking tidy. The height was perfect for what i needed (less than 33\" high and more than 25\") and also goes well with the room. Only thing i wish they had was another opening for cables on the bottom of the back panel and not just the one on the top since the middle shelves split the area in each cubbie. Other than that it's a great console and worth the money for the quality alone.", "I wanted something different for my living room that would more so hid the stuff on the shelves.

It feels high quality but when I removed one of the underside stickers, it actually removed the color/wood texture, so that kinda gives you an idea of what kind of wood you're working with.\nThe size is perfect, it's actually counter height and all of the holes were drilled where they should go.\n\nWord to the wise though, pay extremely close attention to the instructions as they are just diagrams with no words, and just numbered labels. Every label matters and every hole has a purpose and going back to undo one of the first steps will infuriate you with how many screws you have to unscrew.\n\nOtherwise, it's great. Highly recommend, glad I found something that fit my space perfectly so I can start making coffee in my office.\n\nIf I really wanted to, I could replace the MDF with actual wood but that'll likely never happen unless the wood starts to peel and chip. I'll update this review if/when that ever happens.", "Product is well made and cosmetically appealing. Fitment of panels and pieces was good.

Where #9 meets #8, the hole was too small and we had to use a drill to widen it and then source a longer screw we had to make it work. So that's where the extra time went else it probably would've taken an hr and a half.\n\nSeems like a solid piece - we are using it to hold garden supplies so not as an actual bar/liquor cart and it works for us since it has wheels and we can still see everything, but it's now stored together.", "Seems to be holding up very well.

This most fit what I was looking for albeit a bit smaller than I wanted. The shelf on this cart is not designed to be height adjusted. I had to lower it 3.5\u201d for my ice machine to fit. To do this I had to cut down the metal \u201cL\u201d piece in the middle. This was no big deal. Ibises my Dremel tool with a grinding bit and it cut very easily. I cut off the two shelf brackets on the left side. To support the left side, I installed wooden support legs at the needed higher. I cut these legs to mirror the width and depth of the metal. The metal backing comes in two pieces, left and right. I simply left off the left panel so my ice machine could ventilate and it over hangs just a little (wouldn\u2019t have fit with the metal backing). I have some more ideas for this but overall very happy with that way it turned out so far.", "First I must say I was pretty impressed overall with the quality of this cabinet considering it's MDF. I feel like this was extremely easy to put together but I'm not a stranger to puting furniture together. If you're not someone who puts furniture together often this might be challenging for you. My only con is I found a lot of similar products on Amazon for significantly cheaper. At the end of the day this is still an MDF cabinet and not real wood so I feel like it could have been a little cheaper. Regardless I love the smaller cabinet and I have full intention of buying the 60-in cabinet as well. Please note the lights in my photo are not included and I added those myself after the fact.

The only thing that bugs me is the power button is right next to the volume so i keep turning off the phone when i try to change the volume. I've had this phone for over a month and love eveything else about it. The fingerprint scanner works great! My friend try to use it and couldn't get in with the fingerprint scanner and i use an 8 digit passcode also. The battery life is good, with heavy use i charge it every 2 or 3 days, but with low use, once a week. I can watch 2 movies on it and still have 54% battery left. The sound is good but i always use earbuds anyways, but they are not needed. I don't make a lot of phone calls per month so i can get the lowest monthly plan which is about $15 a month for me. The data isn't much and dosn't last long so i just use my home wifi and i turn off the data on the phone. I also like the FM radio, it works great. I like that you can move the phone and the time, date and battery life shows up on screen and if you shake the phone fast, the flashlight turns on and it's ez to turn off. The cameras work as expected and the storage space is good enough for me. I've added a few games, a police scanner (you need wifi for the scanner) and some survival manuals that work without wifi for when i go camping. The phone has ads when you first get it but they can be turned off through the notifications and you can control which app run in the background to save battery life. The phone comes with a great weather app that has helped me through a few storms and it has a live radar, but the notification buged me a bit to much so i turned them off for now. So if you buy it, i hope you enjoy it as much as i do.", "I agree with almost all users and unbiased cell phone expert evaluators that this is one of the best value-for-price phones available. (It's probably short on RAM and processor speed for gaming, but I don't do that.) Browsing is very good; some streaming videos may occasionally look muddy in busy scenes. Great phone features overall. If 16 Gigs of internal storage scares you, be aware that this phone permits you to designate a micro SD card as internal storage; I added a 128 Gig SD card and the phone now thinks it has 144 Gigs of internal storage. (Do an internet search on how to do this.) Important notes: this phone is a Moto e5 XT1920DL. Make sure any case you buy for it is exactly for that model, not for any other Moto e5 model (but note that Moto G6 Play phone cases are perfect for this phone, too.) The battery is not accessible/changeable, but everybody agrees that it's got very good endurance. (Even so, I occasionally hibernate background apps, using a battery saver app, to avoid wasting power on apps I'm not using at the moment. They can always be loaded instantaneously when you actually want them.) Also, this Tracfone uses Verizon as its carrier (although they never readily reveal which carrier goes with which of their phones). You may have a hard time activating this phone on Straight Talk, even if you're already using Straight Talk with another phone, if you don't enter Verizon as the carrier. All in all, this is a very good smart phone at a very low cost; high-end users who want their cell phone to perform like a desktop PC or Apple won't be satisfied, I think.", "This is a good phone considering the price. It's bigger than I thought it would be and has a nice amount of weight to it too. I got a USB cord and a plug-in piece.

So I just use the back of my earring and stick it in there to get it to pop out.\n\nWhen I first started up the phone I had to update it twice (the first update was a 20 minute wait time and the second was about a 7-10 minute wait time). This phone also came with a bunch of apps that I would have never used and it let me 'uninstall them' which most phones don't let you do (which is crappy because that's what eats up a lot of space that you can use.)\n\nI wish this phone had speakers though instead of the sound coming out of the part where you put your ear. The sound is loud when you watch a movie or whatever but I feel it could be louder you know.\n\nAnd it's kind of hard to find a case (you have to search 'Moto e5 TracFone case' or You can try 'Moto e5 5.7 case') and there is not much options to choose from either.

On the negative side, the fingerprint reader is inconsistent at accessing the phone.

The spot lights make it so you can point the beams in two directions. The structure itself is high quality, which you can see and feel, and the lighting output is incredible; I totally understand the price point this is set at and am actually surprised it isn\u2019t more expensive. I was able to set one light beam towards the basement stairs to light the stairwell and landing up for safety and to lead the kids and their sitter to the stairs in the event of a power outage due to a strong storm where seeking shelter is necessary, which happens here often. The other beam is set toward the door to the most interior basement room, where we\u2019ve instructed the kids and their sitter to seek shelter.\n\nAfter seeing just how well it lights the exact path I need them to take to safety, the existence of this lighting structure in our home has given my husband and I peace of mind in knowing, even when the wide range flashlights aren\u2019t left plugged in and lose their charge, the kids won\u2019t be trying to file down the steep basement stairs and around the basement via pinpoint phone light, but can instead run where they need to be with a clear pathway. It will also help our two elderly dogs down the stairs if necessary for the same reasons .", "I have used these LED emergency lights for a while now, they work as advertised. Easy to install, lights are bright and adjustable, fixture looks nice and updated. The cost is a bit high but you can tell by the build quality they are very high-quality, also the feel and the look of this unit is very premium, it will easily live for years without the need of a replacement. I had one LED unit that lasted about 2 years. I'm sure the battery life on this one will outperform the old one, because It has a lithium battery which provides 4 hour of continuous lighting and can support remote head capability.\n\nBrightness wise, they are very bright, they produce 1,100 in a spot pattern, so you can point it to the entrance of your house so thieves won't even think about it, even if the electricity was out.\n\nInstallation was easy, there is a quick connect for the power attached to the mounting bracket for the wires. While this makes wiring easier, it can be difficult to get the connection right. Cut all that plastic clip junk off the mounting bracket, plug the connector into the unit and nut the wires as you put it up. That way you know the connection is made it is way less of a headache.\n\nOverall, this LED emergency lights is an excellent quality, very bright and work as intended, highly recommended", "The old church building on my property has very old emergency lighting system above the doors that we don't even use anymore because they are so expensive- they were made in the late 80's and suck up as much electricity as they can so new emergency lighting was a great find. These will stay lit up for up to 4 hours when you lose electricity- which is often here because trees are always falling on lines in my area. This was easy to install since we already had the wiring and everything was in place, it only took about 15-20 minutes. That evening I killed the electricity and sure enough it stayed nice & bright! I love it! The best part is the cost efficiency.. this light is about 1/10 the cost of my previous lights so this means that I can use it regularly and not have to keep it unhooked like my last ones (I have 2 since it's a commercial building) were. Anyone can use these and you DO NOT have to use them in a commercial building- they can be used in your home/garage/basement/shed/barn/etc.. they are BRIGHT and I mean BRIGHT so be careful about placement so you don't end up lighting up an area too brightly in the night time. This product is worth every penny and will pay for itself in saved electricity and candles. Great 5 star product!", "The saying \"you get what you pay for\" applies here. This is solid, high-quality emergency light. You need to have to wire it directly to an already installed electrical box; it is not possible to plug this into an outlet like a lamp. That said, it is not difficult to install. Instructions are helpful. This provides a lot of light - a total of 1100 lumens - and the three LED lamps are positioned so as to be able to illuminate your space in different directions. This is useful if you have several spots, like some stairs, or a potential hazard, you want to make sure is visible if you lose power. These types of lights used to really suck energy, but with the LED lights and newer tech, this one is very energy efficient. as well as exceeding the code for emergency lighting. In fact, it can be installed from 7.5 feet high to 30 feet high, which obviously goes into the commercial realm. The battery, which provides 4 hr additional run time, is lithium phosphate. There are a lot of cheap look-alike knock-offs of this kind of light, and the price reflects that. If you want a light that you can depend upon to work reliably and well into the future, this is worth the investment.", "We were in need of a new emergency light for the church sanctuary where I pastor and this works perfectly.\n- At first I was taken back by the price but once I started looking at the specs and how long this lasts, I was confident it was a better long term investment than the cheaper models.\n- It is WAY brighter than the other lights that we have used. That is reassuring in the event we have a black out that we can see our way outta the building without issues.\n- The install was straight forward for anyone that has ever changed out a light switch or plug outlet, you should have not trouble installing this\n- It came with everything needed to do the install except tools of course\n- The build quality is what you'd expect from a higher $ emergency light", "We don't have power outages that often, but when we do, we are always scrabbling for some kind of light. This unit is perfect for lighting the way when the power goes out. I mounted the unit in the basement at the base of the stairs, seems a good area to light up. Don't need to be tripping up the stairs in the dark. I've done it before.\n\nThey do seem to work as they are suppose to. I can't say they stay on as long as they are suppose to, but I'll be testing that and update this review if anything changes.\n\nInstall was pretty easy. Comes with instructions that are very detailed with all kinds of diagrams to help you get the unit installed correctly and how to test it.\n\nLove how the lights swivel so much. You could mount this on the wall or on the ceiling.\n\nOverall a great emergency light. Sure it will be very useful for our next power outage.", "This is one bright light! I live in a secluded area and we often have power outages. This unit is very well constructed, and it was easy to install with wiring that was already there. If you have any basic knowledge of wiring and have done your own projects before with previously installed wiring you shouldn\u2019t have any issues. I had it done in less than a half an hour. These lights are very bright and you can adjust them where you want them. I did a test and they held for four hours before I finally decided to put the electricity back on. I feel for the quality of the light that you get, it\u2019s a very good value. It\u2019s also very energy efficient. And if you\u2019ve ever had these types of lighting\u2018s before you\u2019ll know that the older type of these lights can be very wasteful and costly.", "This fixture is more than 4 times the cost of ones that I typically install.\nHowever this one is much brighter.

Places with black painted ceilings, chairs, or other obstacles will do much better with this level of light.\nComes with wire nuts and screws for the backside mounting plate. Says typical lifespan is 10 years. It is usually the battery that goes first. Hopefully will last that long. 5 stars.", "We live in an area where the power goes out more often than our kids! That being said this was installed in a hallway. Just to test it after it was charged we killed the power, it literally lit up the entire hall, dining room and part of the kitchen!

My husband did not change the baby for the 6 hours I was gone because of how well the diaper absorbs. By the second day I noticed a rash on her private so I told him to ensure he uses the diaper rash cream and that he should change her more often. By day 3 the rash had gotten way worst and we even had an argument because I accused him of not taking care of her. I eventually stopped training and decided I would take her of baby myself. No amount of OTC or prescribed cream worked. My baby would close her legs so tight whenever I had to do a diaper change because of how painful it was for her. About 2 weeks later I had to switch diaper brand and used gentian violet on my baby's private and that's when I finally got rid of the nasty yeast rash. This is 5 weeks later and baby now has scars all over her vajayjay that looks like she got a cut down there. I feel so bad for her and for accusing my husband of not taking care of baby.

Now there are pro and cons with these diapers. The pro is that her diaper rash has disappeared, the designs and really cute and there\u2019s no scent along with no leakage issue. The cons is there\u2019s no leak indicator and these diapers do not hold a blowout. I\u2019ve actually had to clean more blowouts with these diapers than I have with buggies and pampers put together.

If I had to choose one for feel it would be the Pampers Pure- but the fit wasn\u2019t as good and would leak poop up the back. These have fathers at the back and fit much better. They get pretty heavy when wet- the material turns to a sort of gel inside- but they keep her really dry and she has zero diaper rash. I have not noticed any chemical smell and we have been using them for about 4 months.", "Ugh, I was so excited to get these for a great deal and enjoy the cute patterns\u2026 until they actually got here.

They only have 3 characters elmo,cookie monster, and oscar. These are good to help him feel wet when he starts to pie and you can see the wetness if they dont have pants on. They will not absorb an entire pee (they are not pullups or cloth diapers) but they will keep the poo off the floor and give you a little more time to get to the potty than regular underwear. Easy to handwash. They shrink a little after the first wash in the machine. They come off pretty easily. My son can pull them down and off and he isnt 2 yet. I got 2 packs so he can make lots of messes and then i just handwash them if i dont have a full load for the washer.

The pair that doesn\u2019t fit is so loose it falls right off. It seems to be stretched out/ bad elastic even though it appears brand new like the others. It is labeled as 3T like the others so it was not a wrong size in the pack... just a production issue. It was still worth it for us even at 6/7. I really appreciate the breath ability of cotton and the extra layers to help catch accidents. When my son wears these underwear and pants, we usually don\u2019t get pee on the floor! He likes the Elmo theme as well.", "Nice training pants with padded protection!", "They were large at first but it will be child dependent. I have twin boys and one is bigger than the other and fit differently even on them. They do shrink a little which I knew in advance from a previous purchase. They are thicker than normal undies which helps with the training but they aren\u2019t leak proof. I\u2019ve tried the plastic ones but that makes the boys sweat so much and more uncomfortable to wear and even worse to change/clean. I got both my boys trained with these and they loved the designs. Again I don\u2019t think they help you train other than they are thicker you still have to train your kids but these are a good transition from diapers.", "I love how thick the undies are. I love the saturation of the colors. I love how long the pad is for when they do have a oops. It fits well on my daughter she is a bit small so the undies are big which I do not mind. I did get the got the 2T so that being said, it fits her pretty well for big underwear (she\u2019s a size 5 in diapers and 18 months in pants and 23 pounds, very skinny and short girl).

It's good because they're not as smug as a pull-up, which I think helped him differentiate not to get these soaking wet like he would a pull up. Yes we went through all 7 pairs in one day, but he got so much better with potty training that, by the last pair, he barely got them wet at all. They are not very absorbent, so again, even his small accident at the end of the day he felt, but that's good because he knew he had peed and was able to get to the bathroom and finish.

I used a tool on the Crucial website to scan my system to confirm what drives would work on my system/motherboard. I already knew I had an M.2 port, but I wasn't sure if i could go from SATA to PCIe. The tool gave me a list of what would work and I just copied the part # and search for it on Amazon.\n\n2. Along with the SSD, I also bought an enclosure/adapter to put the new Crucial drive in to write the clone to from the boot drive (C:). After a bit a looking around I was sure to buy one for PCIe and not SATA, they are not interchangeable.\n\n3. To clone my boot drive (C:) to this new Crucial drive, I used a free version of Marcium Reflect. I just google it and watch some YouTube videos to learn how to use this particular software. I have used cloning software before, but each one is a little different, so I just wanted to make sure I had all my ducks in a row.\n\n4. Once the clone was done. I popped the back cover off my laptop and swapped out my old SATA M.2 SSD with this new Crucial PCIe M.2 drive. The only difference between this and swapping RAM is that there is a retaining screw on the M.2 port.\n\n5. When I tried to reboot my machine I for an error from my BIOS saying there was no BOOT DRIVE CONFIGURATION.\n\n6. I rebooted the computer again and pressed F2 while booting to enter the BIOS (this will vary based on PC manf.)\n\n7. I went to BOOT MANAGER and added a path to the new drive. Having never had to do this, I just look at the path of the old drive and use the same path on the new drive.\n\n8. Rebooted and windows loaded with no problems.\n\n9. Ran a speed test using the free software CrystalDiskMark. The results are the first pic with the top speed of 1523.22. While this was a major improvement over my SATA, I still thought there was some more speed out there. After a little research I found that Crucial has propitiatory software Storage Executive that will optimize the drive.\n\n10. Once I had Storage Executive installed, I opened it up and was underwhelmed. The option in the software that speeds thing up is called Momentum Cache. I soon realized the software did't recognize that I had a Crucial brand SSD mounted to the motherboard. So I had to do some more research and found that I had to change the BOIS from RAID to AHCI.\n\n11. I google RAID to AHCI and read a couple of posts, super easy. While doing my research on why it wan't being recognized, I found a post on Crucial's website that made it sound complicated ---- WRONG, it was easy.\n\n12. Once I changed from RAID to AHCI, I rebooted the machine again. I let it run through all it's startup processes then ran CrystalDiskMark again and got the results in the second pic wit the top speed of 5231.59.\n\nI hope this helps some folks out there.", "First off, Both Dell and Crucial state that this drive is incompatible with my laptop. Having done a little online research (anecdotal comments that large NVME drives worked fine in some folks' systems), I decided to go ahead and give it a try.\n\nThe drive was installed, recognized by the system, and configured as the boot drive without any issues. Rather than cloning the former boot drive, I opted for a clean install of Win 10. During the whole process I encountered no problems with the OS install or configuration.\n\nFor those concerned about heat related throttling issues, it's too soon for me to say whether there are any or not. Having just installed this, I haven't really ran any apps that are data transfer intensive. I can tell you that I initially installed the drive without any heat shield, and during the software install and configuration, temps reached as high as 44 C. After completing the OS/Software setup and configuration, I did install a third party heat shield/sink (mainly because Dell does so on their OEM configurations with NVME drives). I can't tell if it's made a difference yet, but the hottest operating temps since installed has only been about 32C.\n\nIn regards to performance, the new drive is operating as well as I had hoped it would. Without Using Crucial's \"Momentum Cache\" function in their Storage Executive SSD MGMT software, I obtained sequential Read/\nWrites of 1800/1700 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark. This was not unexpected, as many other 5570 owners reported that they got similar results from their 1TB+ Samsung 970 EVO's which should have operated at 3500/3200 MB/s Read/Write Speeds. The issue is a BIOS limitation that has apparently hard coded the NVME Power Settings to a lower state. This lower state limits the performance of many higher end SSD's to roughly half of their potential. This was a purchasing consideration for me, as I didn't feel it was worth it to pay an additional $70 for a higher end Drive that I wouldn't be able to utilize anywhere near its full potential. The Crucial P-1 may not be reaching 2000 MB/s reads, but I'm not complaining as it's only a couple hundred MB/s below its Max Potential.\n\nHaving said that, things change quite a bit when you enable Crucial's \"Momentum Cache\" Function in the Storage Executive software. After enabling it, I got consistent Sequential Reads/Writes of aprox. 6000/6000 MB/s. Your results may vary depending on your BIOS features, Processor, and amount of RAM installed.\n\nAll and all a great value.\n\nA Quick Update: It's been over 6 months since I installed this drive, and it is still running great. I haven't noticed any heat throttling issues, and my laptop has been running very stable.", "I wasn't expecting much from this drive, I already had a Samsung 860 Evo SATA SSD in my laptop, however the 500GB capacity was getting a bit tight. I opted for the 1TB model on Prime Day for a steal at $80. It arrived next day, and the installation was cake (if you can insert a stick of RAM, you can install an M.2 drive.\n\nAfter getting everything installed, cloned, and the boot order modified, the drive was performing about the same as my old SATA SSD on first boot. After installing the requisite Corsair Storage Executive software and making a few tweaks there, the SSD started to really wake up. I can boot to the login screen on my laptop in about 2 seconds after POST. After login, everything is ready to go. Chrome launches instantly, Steam updates in a matter of seconds, and everything is near instant.\n\nThe drive is rated at about 2000MB/s read and 1700MB/s write. Imagine my surprise when Crystal Disk Mark put up an ABSOLUTELY BLAZING 4150+MB/s READ AND WRITE. I was questioning whether or not I was sent the drive I ordered. I reran the test a few more times, and similar numbers came up every time. My 970 Evo NVMe drive in my desktop puts up closer to 3200MB/s, which is still very extremely fast compared to anything on the SATA bus (SATA SSDs normally have about a 550MB/s cap).\n\nGames launch as you would expect for a drive of this speed. Tomb Raider I (1996) and Tomb Raider II (1997), even with DOSbox emulation, are fast and fluid. The 1050 in my laptop doesn't break a sweat on those. The Talos Principle, with everything cranked to the max, only blinks the load screen for a moment before you're in. I don't even remember what the load screens looks like in Portal 2. The recent Tomb Raider games (2013+) load so fast, you can't read the load screen tips, normally only reading the first few words before you're back in the action.\n\nI will say the Samsung software is a little bit better in terms of overall UI and function (Corsair does not offer a self-contained firmware update, you must download the firmware separately and point the software to the downloaded file), however you're not spending any time in there anyway once the Over Provisioning cache is set up and a few other performance related check boxes.\n\nSo your options right now are the following:\n\u2022 Spend twice as much for a Samsung SSD and get slower speeds\n\u2022 Spend less than $100, get 1TB of space, and blow away other, more expensive drives by at least 25%\n\nThis drive will not disappoint!", "I installed this 1TB SSD in my late 2013 MacBook Pro. The write speed increased from 630MB/s to 1230 MB/s and the read speed from 670MB/s to 1450MB/s (Blackmagic and Aja speed tests average). I used the Sintech NGFF M.2 nVME adaptor.\n\nI didn't have any problems with the SSD or the adaptor but had a lot of trouble during the install: The screw that holds the original SSD was so tight that I could have easily stripped the T5 slot by forcing it with the screwdriver, but eventually it came out. I fitted the Crucial SSD and erased and formatted it then tried to install Mojave using my USB flashdrive installer but had an error saying that is was corrupted and could not be used (even though it was fine previously). So I tried to install Mojave over WiFi and got an error saying couldn't connect to the server (even though I was definitely logged in to my WiFi).\n\nThen the Crucial SSD disappeared and could not be located with Disc Utility. Fortunately I had a bootable backup of my entire MacBook Pro on an external SSD, so I booted up from this. Carbon Copy Cloner was able to recognise the Crucial SSD and I was able to make a bootable clone onto it. Unfortunately this was an earlier version Mojave, apps and files but I dared not fiddle about and risk the SSD becoming invisible again, so I just cloned everything.\n\nThe SSD was now installed which was a relief. I then did a complete Time Machine recovery to reinstall everything to how it used to be before upgrading. From start to finish it took about 7.5 hours - about 2.5 hours trying to resolve the problems, and 5 hours waiting for the cloning and TM recovery.\n\nFor most people the SSD upgrade will be a piece of cake, so I'm sharing this as you might want to be prepared if things don't go quite as planned.\n\nI don't think these installation problems had anything to do with either the Crucial SSD or the Sintech adaptor which are working perfectly, and the tremendous speed increase is certainly very noticeable when using Capture One Pro and Photoshop, etc.", "After searching everywhere for information on compatibility with an internal blade NVMe M.2 SSD that would fit inside my Imac 27 inch late 2013 and after reading reviews on this Crucial P1 I gave this Crucial P1 1TB NVMe PCIe internal SSD a try and it fit, HOWEVER, be aware you definitely need an adapter to use this SSD. You can see by my photos this SSD is too short and the screw hole does not line up without using an adapter. The adapter I chose was this, https://amzn.to/3f9NnhW and it worked just fine. The adapter and this SSD fit together like a glove. Even though the packaging states it works with Macbooks this will work with an Imac 27 late 2013. At first the screw hole didn't line up with this SSD and the adapter but I realized I didn't have them pushed far enough into the logic boards connecter. Once I did that everything lined up perfect. There is no screw included with this SSD but there is a screw included with the above adapter. After putting everything back together I was able to boot up into recovery mode and installed Mac OS onto this SSD with no problems. Also on a side note included in the package with this SSD was a little card that said \"notice\" this card cannot support recover from internet. I'm here to tell you first hand that I was able to use \"command R\" on boot up, select this SSD from the list and was able to install Mac OS Catalina over the internet with no problem. However realize when you install on this card it will automatically format the drive into APFS and NOT Mac OS extended journaled. If you feel this has helped you please give me a thumbs up.", "A little context: I'm commercial photographer and videographer and have been using G-Technology G-Drives for the better part of 10 years. I shoot tethered to, work directly off of, and backup to these drives. So needless to say, external hard drives are an integral part of my workflow.\n\nI've been researching SSD drives for some time now but have been waiting for the price/GB to come down. I've had my eye on this Crucial 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD for probably the past 6 months. I saw the price dip to $95 and decided to pull the trigger. And oh my god am I glad I did. Using Blackmagic's Speed Test I measured both my 2TB 7,200RPM G-Drive and this 1TB NVMe SSD. My G-Drive came in at an average of 108 MB/s with USB-A 3.0, which I've been used to for some time. I was completely astounded when I saw that my new Crucial 1TB NVMe SSD was getting 9x's better (!!!!!) read/write speeds at an average of 932 MB/s with USB-C. With USB-A to USB-C it was averaging around 460 MB/s. Which is still insane compared to my now dinosaur of a G-Drive.\n\nI paired this with the Sabrent USB 3.1 NVMe M.2 SSD Aluminum enclosure (https://amzn.to/35yLsi0) and could not be happier with the results. I wish this drive came in a 2TB+ option as I would likely pick up several of them. But this is an incredible step for me in the transition towards an all-SSD workflow.\n\nI'm including a screenshot of the Speedtest and photo of the the drive in the Sabrent enclosure for size context.\n\nSOME NOTES\n\u2022 It's very small, only a little bigger than a stick of gum.\n\u2022 Installation in an external NVMe M.2 enclosure is extremely simple.\n\u2022 Being a Mac user you will have to reformat this drive for it to work with your system (which I would recommend you do with any external hard drive anyway).\n\u2022 The speed is outrageous.\n\u2022 Only time will tell the longevity and performance of the drive as I've only been testing it for several days.\n\nFor the price and performance, I would highly recommend buying this drive.", "So this is for an Acer Predator Helios 300... ( PH315-5178NP to be precise)\nThe genius crew over at Acer didn't include a maintenance panel on the back for the system hard drive, only one for the RAM and one for the 2.5\" drive bay.\nWhen I bought this drive, I mistakenly thought there was an nvme m.2 expansion slot to add another drive. Wrong.\nSo I had to replace my system drive with this drive, and to do that I had to jump through a few hoops.\nIncluding removing the entire back panel from the laptop to access the m.2 hdd slot.\n\nSo here's the adventure I went on:\n\nBought this m.2 (M-keyed) pciex4 nvme 1Tb drive.\nRealized there was no expansion slot.\nLooked into the included 'Acronis True Image' and it requires at least one of the drives in the imaging pair to be a Crucial drive.\nOrdered a Crucial 1Tb 2.5\" MX500 ssd.\nWhen that arrived:\nCloned my original 256G non-Crucial branded m.2 drive over to the new 2.5\" ssd.\nRemoved the original m.2 drive, and put this new Crucial m.2 1Tb drive in place.\nCloned the 2.5\" MX500 ssd to this new m.2 1Tb drive.\nRemoved the 2.5\" MS500 ssd and booted Windows off this Crucial m.2 1Tb drive.\nAdded the 2.5\" drive back to the system, formatted it.\n\nSo now my system drive is this Crucial m.2 1Tb drive, with the Crucial MX500 1Tb 2.5\" ssd as the expansion drive.\nNow it's got 2Tb of storage, and the main drive is clocking read speeds at the 2k mark.\n\nWent from 256G total storage to 2Tb of total storage, and a big improvement in speed.\n\nNow this laptop is a legit gaming rig and I can install several big AAA title games without the fear of running out of storage space.\n\nThis crucial drive is running Windows very quickly, all Windows-related tasks are accomplished instantly.\nVery impressed with the performance/value.\nThe Crucial Acronis True Image software is very good. Perfect at cloning the original drive multiple times with no issue, and perfect for 'cleansing' the storage drive. Very pleased overall with this purchase.", "I've had this drive for 5 months now. I'm a programmer and am constantly keeping this drive on it's toes by rebuilding solutions to generate new files to test changes or debug issues.\n\nI am using this in conjunction with an i9-9900 intel processor, RTX 2070 video card, and 32 gigs of 2,000 mhz DDR4 memory. This has been up to this point the only hard drive in my system since I built it back in May and has performed without an issue. I originally had planned on having an additional drive to use for storage of bulk files but the standard hard drive that I ordered was DoA, thus where I had planned to give the SSD some breathing room, I instead ended up using it for everything. I'm now back on the page not because something went wrong with the existing drive, but rather because I've run out of space and found myself needing to delete things to make room for other things. I also play games on this computer and most of the programming I do is game related. So here I am with 2 more of them in my cart to install in the same system. Sub-totals at $191.98 making it still $100 or so less than the standard price on those EVO drives, and they perform well enough that I doubt I would see any kind of improvement by switching drives.\n\nFor those that say they have received defective drives, or their drives slows down, I'm sorry to hear that you are unlucky with the purchase and that all the drives aren't like that. With amazon's customer support I'm sure you'd be able to exchange the product and get another one in exchange without much issue. Hopefully the issue doesn't resurface in a replacement part for you and you get to enjoy the smooth easy data transfers that I have come to enjoy.", "This was the cheapest NVME drive I could find, and overall it is a good buy.\n\nCrucial is a known brand, and I used to have memory from this maker, so I thought that the quality would be at least as good as Samsung; and in part this is true.\n\nPerformances so far, show that while it does not hit the peak of other NVME that cost twice as much, it is still quite fast, compared to regular SSD M2, running on SATA3. NVME protocol is used to boost performances and you can tell the difference.\n\nJust some numbers: my internal M2 SATA3 drive read at 521MB/s and write at 480 MB/s; while the internal SATA3 Samsung drive read and write at 530 MB/s. This NVME read at 1798 MB/s and write at 1020 MB/s; so as you can see; the speed is noticeable in both read and write.\n\nIf you use this drive for activities that involve fast loading, like video editing, gaming or 3d ; it is a really good buy; but if you plan to use it as everyday drive to run your productivity apps, or as backup, or to move often, small files, then you won't see much improvement. For example for smaller files, the faster one was the SATA3 Samsung, with speed that was consistently higher than both the NVME and M2 drives in writing; sometimes 10-15% faster, just to give you an idea\n\nSSD are not made for backups, nor for moving small files or for productivity in general; at least you don't need NVME for this; because such usage short the lifespan of your SSD; but if you move large files and need a high data transfer rate, then this is the memory for you.\n\nGranted, Samsung cost more for a reason; although this drive is fast enough, compard to your regular SATA3 M2 drive or regular SSD; to make a world of difference", "This particular device is a \"consumer grade\" SSD, not intended to support large file transfers. If you need to move big files, a Samsung SSD most likely will fit your needs better. One thing I will say -- the downloadable Crucial SSD management software, \"Crucial Storage Executive\", is a major help. Using this software, I was able to update the SSD's firmware, over provision the drive, and set aside some of my laptop's RAM to serve as a cache. These changes greatly improved the drive's performance and enable me to change what would have been a 2-star or 3-star rating to a 4-star rating.\n\nHere are some more details.\n\nI didn't understand the limitations of the QLC technology used in the P1, so I purchased my P1 considering only its stated capacity and stated max throughput rates. I saw no notices in the device's on-line literature that it is intended for light-duty small-file operations. The first time I tried to copy a large (200 GB+) virtual image to the device, I was shocked to see write rates on the order of only 50 MB/sec. Further, the device ran very hot.\n\nClearly, I was very disappointed. Then, I discovered the Crucial Storage Executive software, which made it easy for me to update the device's firmware. With the P3CR013 firmware upgrade in place, I get large-file sustained write performance in line with what I would expect to see in a SATA drive -- around 500 MB/sec. Further, the device appears to run cooler. Still, the device greatly under-performs in reality vs. the performance specs that are shown in the Web-based literature. Crucial should be less deceptive and be very clear regarding the appropriate usage patterns for this device.", "OK...I never leave reviews but after spending months on trying to figure out how to stop the restarts after installing I figured I'd post in hopes of maybe helping someone solve their problem way faster. I bought the crucial P1 1TB and both the short and long sintech adapter cards (tried them both) to upgrade my early 2015 MacBook pro. The computer would log out of the OS and i would have to re-log in. It was clearly related to the MacBook sleeping or hibernating (I initially thought this was \"Kernel Panic\"). I tried to change the power settings using terminal after reading many blogs but I couldn't make it work. I would leave the MacBook and hours later it had logged me out. I should say that when I didn't let it sleep the adapter and ssd worked great and was significantly faster than the oem Apple disk.\n\nSolution: I installed the program Amphetamine and \"started a session\" with the default values. Problem solved. I close the lid and come back next day and all programs and tabs open after putting in my password. I recognize this likely uses more battery but I am almost always plugged in so not an issue. I also realize that changing the power settings in terminal may work if you are savvy enough to find the right combo (I was not). I am not affiliated with any of the products or programs mentioned in this review. Hopefully this helps someone in need.\n\nDA", "At this price point, this drive is a no-brainer: it's an NVMe SSD from one of the best names in the business, but at the same price point as a SATA SSD. The performance isn't on par with high-end SSDs like the Samsung EVO or Pro series, but it's still much better than even a top-notch SATA SSD.\n\nIn the worst cases, the performance is at least as good as any SATA SSD. In all other cases, performance is definitely beyond that of any SATA SSD, albeit about 1/2 to 2/3 the performance of a top-tier NVMe drive.\n\nThis is not a great drive for constant heavy loads, such as a database server, but it's perfect as a daily driver for demanding applications that work in bursts of activity, such as gaming or pro audio (I personally need and use large SSDs for both).\n\nIf the upcoming 2TB version is priced similarly, I'll definitely purchase one of those as well.\n\nCopying a 25GB folder of video files (average size is about 200MB each) happened in seconds, and rocketed by at about 1300 MBps. The source drive was a 970 EVO 1TB NVMe SSD.\n\nCopying a 27GB folder of over 40,000 audio samples (mostly small files, such as one-second drum hits) took about 2 minutes. The transfer speed was about 50 MBps at the lowest, and about 400 MBps peak. The slower speeds were due to batches of tiny files. The source drive was a Micron M1100 2TB SATA 2.5\" SSD, which limits the top read speed to about 500 MBps.\n\nCopying the 25GB video folder from the P1 back to itself took about 1 minute, ranging from about 200 MBps to about 2000 Mbps. Caching and other under-the-hood magic probably accelerated this process.\n\nThe temps are about the same as any other M.2 SSD (48 C idle, 64 C at constant load for a few minutes). The temps were slightly lower than those of my 970 EVO 1TB M.2 NVMe in the same system.", "This was a great NVMe SSD for the time. Didn't completely utilize PCIe 3.0, but was considerably better than the MX500 I also had. Now, there are better options for around the same price.", "Now that is installed and I have cloned my old drive onto it, the Crucial P1 works well. But restoring my data onto the drive was painfully slow. This was not unexpected to me, but still a bit annoying.\n\nBe aware that this SSD will write only about 15-100gb at NVMe speeds before dropping to SATA3 drive speeds (~300MB/s). I probably won't have such large writes happen again in daily life, but it certainly taxed my patience to wait for 3 hours while it wrote ~220GB of files. This is by design on QLC drives; the SLC cache is only so large and when it fills it has to fold the data into the slower QLC storage. Normally this isn't a big deal, but good to know.\n\nI installed this in a late 2013 Retina Macbook Pro (13\") using the short version of the SinTech NVMe adapter without a hitch, other than having to disable hibernate using pmset from the command line. Physical installation took only about 20 minutes. Installing Mojave took 30 min. Then nearly 3 hours to restore from a time machine hard drive connected by USB3.\n\nThe measured write transfer speeds jumped from about 600 MB/s using the 256gb Apple ssd to 1250 MB/s using the 1TB P1. This is close to the maximum expected for a 2013 rMBP and was measured under optimal load testing (1GB writes).\n\nI can also say during normal usage the computer also feels faster (not that it felt slow to begin with). The largest software program I use, GIMP, loads about twice as fast.\n\nI mainly bought it to upgrade my storage space, and the speed increase is a nice bonus. All in all, I'm quite happy with the product and the price/performance ratio.\n\nThe instructions I followed to upgrade an SSD in a 2013 rMBP were from a thread on MacRumors; the SinTech adapter is available on Amazon.", "I bought this at a sale price. At the full price of 99.99, I would have considered paying a little bit more to get a higher performing SSD.\n\nI'm not a super techie. I'm not running benchmarks or scrutinizing every second of performance. At the sale price this was just fine for what I need. Everything seems to load as quickly as the Western-Digital SSD I was using previously.\n\nI have noticed, however, that its read/write capability seems to take a nosedive once you've filled it to 70% capacity. But even at this slower speed, it still performs better than I imagine any standard HDD's could.\n\nGet it on sale and it's a great deal. Full price, I would consider some of the other options out there that are right around the full price range that might perform better.\n\nGood Stuffs:\n- This is definitely going to be one of the cheapest 1TBSSD's out there.\n- Is going to perform sufficiently well to cover the needs of most non-hardcore pc users.\n- Smaller NVMe SSD form factor makes it less likely to be used as a weapon by my girlfriend to hurt me.\n- It will probably be good enough for the casual pc user to store all of their selfies and cat pictures.\n\nNot So Good Stuffs:\n- Performance takes a hit after filling it to 75%. But these things tend to need space to breathe in general.\n- If you're capable of doing in-depth testing with graphs/maths/benchmarks and throwing\ncrazy numbers and doing calculus and graphs and S#*@ when you talk about SSD performance - this is probably not\ngoing to cut it.", "I picked up one of these drives when it was on sale - couldn't beat the price for the amount of storage - and threw it into my new Ryzen 2700 build in the secondary NVME slot on my motherboard.\n\nOverall - great drive if you aren't doing huge data transfers all the time. I primarily use it for extra storage and put my Steam games and some of my extra files on the drive - it's not my primary OS drive (I use a Samsung 970 EVO 500GB as my primary OS drive).\n\nI've experienced the following during large data transfers (400GB+):\n-Overheating. I got this drive up to 96C (200F) which is crazy! You could almost boil water on that thing! Thus, I went and picked up a NVME heatsink with a small fan on it and at full RPM it keeps the drive around 50C.\n-Slowdown during the data transfer. At first, I thought this was being caused by the overheating issue, however after installing the heatsink and once again doing a large data transfer, it appears the buffer cache fills up and the drive spends a lot of time writing to flash from the cache and the OS has to wait for it to catch up. Thus, it will start out fast and then slow down once the buffer cache fills up.\n\nI would recommend this drive if you need some extra storage, but I wouldn't use this as the primary NVME drive in your system if you value performance. I would also recommend picking up a NVME heatsink with a fan if you're going to get this drive to prevent it from cooking itself.", "As a veteran of the days when having a 10 Mb hard drive was a REALLY big deal, I feel kind of whiney complaining about getting near the end of capacity in my 512 Gb NVME drive. But, it's not me writing drivers of a couple hundred Mb, so I'll just continue to make sure I've got enough storage of the right type. That 512 Gb NVME drive is by FAR the greatest single step in improvement in the performance in my otherwise kinda mundane low-TDP i3 ITX machine. But, as mentioned earlier, I was running out of space and opted to double storage for a manageable price at the same time I was upgrading from W7 to W10. That's all done now, and I even salvaged the 512 Gb unit in an NVME adapter that sits on the PCI bus, so it's at least in the same ballpark as the one on the back of the motherboard. All of the Windows transition stuff is now done, the MB is back in the MITX case, and the fan is barely audible as I type this. My computing life is nearly back to normal, where it's just a tool instead of a big honking chunk of work. And did I mention there was not even a single issue with the Crucial 1Tb drive - no funky pre-driver before the OS could even see it, no nothing but plug it in, tighten the screw, and start loading software.

Ok an fun for the littles but for the parents are ears are gna bleed. Its fine. Lol whatever it takes to see them beautiful smiles I gues. Another con is that yes it is a heavy bulb at the end. So no your child when you get it. If your child is at a stage wear there hitting an stuff I wouldent recommend. If your child is special needs an tends to hit or throw I wouldent recommend this. But my 2 year old will do fine with it an she may drop it when shes done playing but she doesnt hit or anything. One other possible con is that its a light stick with a heavy top.

Until it inevitably flies through the TV.\n\nPS - For all the people complaining that the song isn't long enough, flip the switch located on the side of the wand from \"TRY ME\" mode to \"ON\" mode.

Hope this helps someone!", "Pretty cool. One thing i will say though, my little sister thought it was broken because the music wouldnt play when the on/try-me settings where on. After messing with it alittle bit, i found that the batterys just where not pressed down hard enough to established the connection. so we had to screw in the lid on the batterys tighter to grant us that connection. If i didnt have to do alittle effort i would of gave a 5 but because of that, the 4 star rating is more applicable", "First it requires 3 expensive batteries and although it says comes with it the batteries in ours were dead. Finally get it working and it's not really a song that it plays. It's like 5 seconds of music. And it's not even clear sounding. It's super heavy too for a kids toy. And the snow globe part is almost blurry. It's hard to even see the girls and there's no way to clean the inside of it of course. Would not gift or recommend!", "So far so good.

It plays a terrible version (think elevator music) of one song from Frozen 2 over and over and over until you want to \u201cmisplace\u201d it the moment your child isn\u2019t looking. But I kind of expected that so that\u2019s not really the problem. The real problem I have with this is it\u2019s not what I expected as far as weight, like previous reviews mentioned this thing is like a hammer. It\u2019s a heavy rubber ball on the end which is great for durability but not so great for pets and younger siblings or anything in your home below knee level. My daughter dances and spins with it and accidentally hit our dog in the face with it. Luckily he\u2019s a big, sturdy, patient, mastiff but it still dazed him and now he gets out of dodge when he hears that song start. I imagine this thing could really hurt a baby sibling or smaller animal even without mal intention on part of the child but you put this thing in the hands of a kid with a mean streak and you would be in for a disaster. What do kids do with wands? They swing them around and pretend to cast spells and bibity bobity boo things with them. So, making this thing like a baby Thor hammer was not a good plan. I thought of getting rid of it but I might keep it to wack intruders in case of a break in. Don\u2019t buy this thing if you value anything in your home within reach of your child."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KX26KRF", "title": "Lush Decor, Blush Ruffle Diamond Shower Curtain | Textured Vintage Chic Farmhouse Style Design, x 72, 72\" x 72", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81J63eOT9BL._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "1,051 ratings", "description": "This Ruffle Diamond shower curtain will immediately enhance the look of your bathroom.

Very comfortable through bending, squatting, climbing, sitting, standing, walking at work, first time you pull them on, til you finally take them off... same fit! That was also surprising to me.

I usually buy through my employer (typical anchor department store), but I decided to try Amazon, as the price advertised was much lower than ANY store, be it a brick and mortar establishment, or online. I also decided to try a pair for myself. First, I will say that these ARE legitimate Levi's, I work with Levi's every day and would consider myself to be well versed in their fits, materials, and feels. These are 100% authentic despite several reviews. I'm assuming the suspicion from some reviewers has to do with the fact that Levi's is adding \"stretch\" material to most of their jeans, resulting in a discrepancy in overall feel for longtime wearers. This \"stretch\" material is elastane, 1% of the total fabric makeup, to be exact. This makes for a more stretchy jean, my fear, however, is that these jeans will begin to do what other jeans containing elastane do, what I call \"The Wave\", particularly in the crotch area where the most movement happens (pun intended). This, of course, remains to be seen. Secondly, the jeans I usually wear in my particular waist size tend to be a little bit larger than my actual waist (upper hip area, where the rise of those jeans, and the Levi's is), these Levi's are EXACTLY the size of my waist. They are, however, rather forgiving, and not overly constrictive. My fianc\u00e9 tells me this is the case with all of his Levi's as well. Overall I'm pleased with my purchase, however, I wish Levi's did offer a \"super skinny\" option for those of us with \"bird legs\", and I hope they offer (possibly directly from Levi's?) a 100% cotton variation of these jeans. Buy them, you'll be pleased.", "Comfy and looks great", "So good", "I\u2019m 6\u20195\u201d and 155. Extremely skinny and slim. I rocked a 32x36 in Levi 510 skinny for years. They were perfect. After a wash, they shrunk to a perfect 34 inseam. I replaced them with the 517 (or maybe they\u2019re 519, can\u2019t remember) super skinny which were fine but lower quality in blue colors but very durable in black colors. No idea why.\n\nRecently I\u2019ve decided to revamp and wear a slightly looser fitting denim, so I switched to the new Levi skinny, these 510 model. I tried a pair on in one of their flagship stores in San Francisco. The 32x34 fit very long and very loose, more like a 34x38. Like no human being fits those dimensions. So of course I ordered on amazon for half the in-store price but went from 32x34 to 31-34, because I can always get them hemmed if they\u2019re long, but I can\u2019t ever fix the waist size.\n\nThese ones were pretty much a perfect fit out of the box, which was great at first, but they were insanely different from the several pairs I tried in-store and hadn\u2019t shrunk or been washed yet. This is a huge QC issue with these inferior new jeans Levi is sewing their brand name on. I can\u2019t wash these without a huge shrink in size.\n\nThankfully I decided to keep and wash, they shrunk maybe an inch or half of an inch. But the wild side inconsistencies are a huge turn off to the Levi brand. As someone with my tall skinny frame, I need some decent denim to rely on.", "Got this at a discount. It fits very well", "Let me begin by sharing how well these jeans fit if you find your size. My reason for leaving a review today however is due to the pants not holding up for long. I've had these pants since mid September, and I wear them several times a week. I wash them maybe every 7/10 days depending on how hard I go (mgr in grocery store, disc golf reg, onewheel anytime I can). Sadly near the rear they have already worn out and have a hole that will inevitably get larger or full on tear with an ill timed squat sometime soon. Will this prevent me from getting another pair....prob not cus they do fit really well for the style/cut. Just know if they are going to be heavy rotation pants might not last as long as desired.", "I love these jeans! I did notice that they collect lint VERY easily though, animal hair included, so use a wool ball or a lint roller if you dry them in a dryer.

However, I wanted to provide an initial review. I will revise my review if I have any additional thoughts after prolonged use. Here it goes:\n- Seems to work all day. I haven\u2019t done any strenuous exercise but it seemed to withstand regular activity and 80+ degree weather. I could still smell the deodorant at the end of the day.\n- As far as fragrance, I purchased the vanilla and cedar. I was hoping for a musky smell. Instead, it smells like straight coconut. I kept thinking, \u201cthe vanilla in this is really strong and sweet smelling,\u201d but then realized it wasn\u2019t the vanilla I was smelling. I don\u2019t love the smell of coconut and reviewed the ingredients again\u2026 duhhhh\u2026 made with coconut oil. You should only be prepared for this if you dislike the smell of coconut like I do. Otherwise, you probably won\u2019t care. It is bearable, it was just unexpected. Even still, the fragrance is fresh and natural smelling.\n- My biggest concern was from the reviews that I read about staining clothes. I have worn several materials with it on and haven\u2019t noticed any staining on undergarments or tops. I hope this continues to be a positive.\n- It applies easily. I was skeptical about application and consistency because it is made with a variety of oils. The consistency is definitely different from conventional aluminum deodorants, but I actually like it better. It is oily, but feels like it takes less in application than what I am used to. I hope this means that it will last longer.\n\nOverall, I am impressed with this product. It is important to note that I did not purchase this product for any hypoallergenic reasons and I do not suffer from excessive perspiration. I am just slowly transitioning many of my personal care products to natural products to eliminate some of the toxicity being consumed in my everyday life. I have never used any type of natural deodorant before and didn\u2019t know what to expect (at least, not beyond the reviews that I read here on Amazon), but am pleasantly surprised with the effectiveness of the product. I hope it lasts and that I can continue to use it!", "The first couple sticks I purchased were great-- no scent at all. After that though, the majority that we get have some of the floral scent (jasmine maybe), probably because it picks up residue from one of the scented ones during manufacturing. I can't handle scents of any kind, even natural, so switching to something else. If it was just 1 stick out of many, that would be different, but it's been almost every stick we've received in the last year. My husband uses the smelly ones because he doesn't mind. Otherwise, I loved this deodorant. Works really well at keeping down the stink. Doesn't block perspiration, but no natural deodorants do and I think it's healthier to perspire naturally.", "When I I had to switch to an aluminum-free deodorant for health reasons, I thought I was doomed to stink for the rest of my life. I've tried so many aluminum free deodorants and have been disappointed with all of them. This deodorant changed everything! It smells fresh and light and amazing, but it's strong enough that it lasts 12 hours plus! At the end of the day, you still smell the deodorant and not yourself LOL. It's very creamy in texture and seems to stay on really nicely. It has not stained my clothes and I'm using less of it because I don't have to reapply it several times a day. So, even though it's a little more expensive, it lasts a lot longer. Definitely worth the money!", "I am 68 years and have been overly sensitive to underarm deodorants of all kinds for well over 40 years. Trust me I have tried so many different kinds and brands, dry, wet, powdery, crystal's, etc.\nI have had severe painful allergic skin reaction to many. Finally I have just used cornstarch powder which has been ok but am tired of the dusty powder everywhere. I did research on new products with no additives, aluminum, etc. and found several. I chose this one, Cardamom/Ginger which is a lovely light scent. It is a little damp but tolerable for me. So far after two weeks now I have not had any reaction. No burning, itchiness, redness, pain, or sensitivity. After all these years it is nice to be able to use a product again. I will try a different scent next time just for variety sake. But I really like this one.", "So I\u2019ve used clinical strength antiperspirants my whole life because I would sweat and no matter the deodorant, it would still produce an odor. Recently I started to put cocoa butter underneath my arms as a scent barrier and it would work amazing. I\u2019d still sweat with heavy antiperspirants so I decided to just go without aluminum since cocoa butter would work better. I tried this and the scent lasted all night working at the hospital, easy to clean in the shower and doesn\u2019t feel gritty. All night during sleep it lasted and at work I can smell it from the application in the morning. No sweat, no odor and it smells SOOO GOOD. Like a fresh bouquet or roses and a little sweet vanilla which I love. I wish this came as a body spray. I have sensitive skin and I didn\u2019t break out and it hasn\u2019t been itchy. If you\u2019re on the fence, just buy it. You won\u2019t regret it!", "I ordered both the citrus & vetiver and the cedar & vanilla and like the scent of the citrus & vetiver quite a bit better for men. The product works well to keep me smelling great throughout the entire day. The packaging and branding are nice and the stick applies well. My only complaint is that there is no reason this product should cost this much. If you're on a budget, Think/ ThinkSport has a comparable deodorant that's effective, safe, and natural for about half the price. I highly recommend either one of these products though over poisoning yourself & the environment with Old Spice.", "I bought the Cedar and Vanilla and if I focus very hard I can occasionally separate out a scent but for the most part it smells overwhelmingly like coconut, as another reviewer said. The scents might be more distinct for other people who have different reads on scent, but I definitely feel like I just put tanning lotion on my underarms. The product itself is fine (otherwise it would be a 3-star review), but I don't think I can use it at this rate and I am hesitant to try a different scent.", "I got the rose vanilla one but doesn't really smell much if either, I can't smell vanilla at all, and it does smell floral, but not rose floral, it has more of a hint of citrus. It did mask my ider pretty well though so I'll give it that! And they weren't kidding when they said long lasting!", " I\u2019ve been buying so many different deodorants trying to find the one that won\u2019t burn my armpits (baking soda) and that it doesn\u2019t have toxic chemicals (triclosan, aluminum, propylene glycol, phthalates, parabens & fragrance) like every other deodorant in stores - for a while now\u2026 so I finally gave in and bought the lavender scented one. The smells is really nice, there\u2019s so many oils in this product that the deodorant is beyond smooth. I\u2019d love to give it 5 stars but since it\u2019s so natural and not anti-perspiration, I sweat throughout the day and the scent goes away. I think I reapply the deodorant (to smell better) like 2x a day. However I believe once winter comes I won\u2019t have to do that. Other than that, it is good! I haven\u2019t seen any stains in my clothes nor does it burn my sensitive skin.", "I've been hunting for a non toxic deodorant for a couple of year's . Other brands have caused me to get a rash. I've been using Each & Every for a month. It's great and holds up!", "I've tried so many deodorants and after awhile they wear off and honestly I think all the perfumes make you smell worse. I get sticky and my underarms get super dry from regular deodorant, this is very moisturizing and I have zero body odor and it lasts all day!", "The scent longevity is not that great.", "I really love this scent. It\u2019s mildly floral and my fav scent they offer, to date. Juniper Mint is in close second. This is a seasonal scent so I\u2019m planning to order more soon.", "I really do like this deodorant and have ordered it several times, However it's far too expensive. I feel like the makers are price guaging their customers. I am in progress of finding another natural deodorant that's cheaper.", "I have been on the hunt for a good deodorant for like three years now. I have really sensitive skin which made my skin worse everytime I tried it. I have used like 4-5 natural and aluminum based deodorants till now. Each and every was my last attempt to go anywhere near deodorants. Really happy that I went with this. Smells good, stays for a long time and perfect for my sensitive skin.", "Excellent product. Costs more; but lasts long so it comes out in the wash.

Finally I tried these overnights a size up and I havent had leaks in a few weeks! For some reason this specific diaper absorbs much faster then the dozen others I\u2019ve tried. Very satisfied!", "I have used Hello Bello night diapers on my son for the past year. They\u2019re fantastic and don\u2019t get too fat by morning, but he seems to be outgrowing size 6\u2019s. I decided to try Huggies night diapers since their regular diapers in size 6 seem to be a little bigger than Hello Bello\u2019s. These absolutely SUCK in comparison! I honestly don\u2019t think they\u2019re any different than regular Huggies diapers\u2026 They get super fat and swollen after four hours. I left one on the entire night, and by morning he was leaking horribly and had red marks where the waist bad was since it got so fat and swollen.\n\nThe diapers themselves did fit bigger, so I know they\u2019re not too small. I was just surprised that they didn\u2019t have better absorption than their regular diapers do. I\u2019ll be sticking with Hello Bello for a bit, then moving on to Ninjamas.

However, I have a subscription but I\u2019m told they will be discontinued. Noooooo!", "Works for what it's for", "These are great wish they had not been DC", "As a woman of a certain age, a couple of years I began occasionally have a bit of bladder leakage when getting up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night. I tried a few incontinence pads but I always had leakage on the sides and the only brand that sold a pad with wings was insanely expensive. I started using period pads with wings but they tended to leak. After a couple of years of frustration I finally just started searching again and was so happy to see that Poise was producing incontinence pads with wings again (I had read online that they used to make them but then had stopped.) I tried these and they are absolutely perfect. I've only had a couple of bladder leaks but the pads perfectly absorbed everything and I was able to return to bed without having to change underwear in the middle of the night. It's interesting what makes you happy when as you age!", "Ladies, you'll want to keep an extra pad in your purse, not necessarily for protection against accidents of a liquid kind, but just in case you're ever in need of something that can stand in for kRazyy glue! Seriously, do NOT attach these things to your most prized and delicate unmentionables! In the rare event you do, and you find one the things actually comes apart while trying to peel it out of your undies, a degreaser dish soap, water and a little patience will allow you to safely remove the adhesive without ruining your panties.", "I've been using the regular long poise liners for several years and have been happy with them and when I saw this version with the wings I thought I would give them a try. There seems to be some confusion in other reviews where people are complaining that these are not long. I think people do not realize that there are poise pads which are for heavier flow and there are poise liners which are the thinnest ones that they sell. These are liners and the ones with wings in long are actually longer than the non-wing long liners, so that is actually very good. I've also seen a review where someone complains they weren't wide enough and wouldn't fit anybody over a size 14. I'm a size 26 and they fit just fine and fill the entire width of my underwear, so I don't know what that other review was talking about. I've also seen multiple reviews about how the adhesive is way too sticky and was sticking to their underwear. Again, I don't know what kind of underwear they're using, but I wear jockey Elance cotton underwear and I haven't had anything stick to it to the point that I couldn't pull it off or it left adhesive behind. They stay put and when it's time to remove them I remove them. Anyway, these function exactly as I would expect them to, and I definitely appreciate the addition of wings.", "I\u2019ve only used these today and yesterday, but so far I\u2019m impressed. I don\u2019t have a lot of experience with these products but I\u2019ve been very sick (going on seven weeks) and by week 4.5 my bladder couldn\u2019t quite take the coughing fits anymore. I\u2019m only 35 with no previous incontinence issues and I\u2019m fine for the first half of the day, so I\u2019m not asking too much of these. Prior to trying these (and the regular line) I used the Always adult diapers. I had them leftover from when my son was born and honestly, I didn\u2019t like them for postpartum bleeding nor did I like them for their intended purpose. They fit badly, didn\u2019t wick away moisture, and bagged in important areas. I\u2019m really glad I ran out of those and switched to these.\n\nAs far as this specific product goes, I can only compare it to the regular line (moderate absorbency, long length). I spent the past 10 days at Disney and these sport ones didn\u2019t come in time. I wish they had. While I do like the longer length of the regular ones, I feel like these would have been way more comfortable. They appear to hold the same amount of urine, and these are easily half the thickness. If you\u2019re wanting to wear things like leggings, these would be way less obvious! The wings are a nice touch, but I was okay using the regular ones that didn\u2019t have them. The big difference would be the elastic. These have more than the regular line, those only have it right in the middle. That\u2019s great and all, but I feel more secure with these sport ones that have it running along the whole pad. This was an issue I had with regular maxi pads. They have a tendency to be a little surfboard-ish. That\u2019s fine for your period since volume wise they will hold 15-30mls (depends on type) but that can be what you leak during any bladder leak. So obviously, without a snug fit asking a pad to take its max capacity suddenly is asking for trouble. I had a particularly bad coughing fit and was quite a way from the bathroom. That was the only time I got scared about a leak and I really didn\u2019t need to be these just hold up great.", "I like them, it\u2019s hard to find ones with wings that are also thin, it\u2019s kinda on the thick side. But I will continue wearing them as they are working very well. I only need them for coughing or sneezing.", "This one is a great one. only if they mail you the one that I ordered", "I like that these are not bulky. I bought them, however, for when I go to the gym and found that they DO NOT stay in place. the wings are on them do not have an adhesive and so are pointless and in fact, get stuck onto the bottom of the pad, which is extremely annoying.", "Only issue I have with these is that they are almost TOO sticky. I struggle to get these off without ripping, typically in the tab area. I've had to use water to get the stuck pieces of the tab off several times as I don't want it coming off in my washing machine. Otherwise, very absorbent and comfortable.", "I get them for my mother in law, bladder control problems\u2026 she loves them, they don\u2019t bother her", "They work really well and are not huge and bulky! Wish they were on prime quick shipping. Satisfied!!!", "This was a higher absorbency pad than those that I had previously used with Poise. This time I went with a pad that also had \u201cwings\u201d in the hopes that it would keep the pads from bunching up and thus make them ineffective. Well, it did, and it didn\u2019t. Some days they were super, and some days not so much. I wear 100% cotton panties so the sticking power of the wings should have been great. Nope, no consistency. I still am afraid to get out for any length of time without embarrassing myself. I hope my physician can give me some help, but so far what is in the marketplace is not proving reliable. I don\u2019t want to go out looking like a bubble but by having to wear several forms of incontinense type protection.", "The comfortable and service the purpose I use them . I would however like to see the wings expanded for security", "These Poise active liners are just what I need for during a busy work day or playing with the grandchildren. They hold in any wetness and odor so well I don\u2019t feel like I am wearing a liner for bladder control. Great for night time too!", "I used to use the \"overnight\" version of these, which were much bulkier, because I was afraid of leakage. I'm so glad I switched! These are much more comfortable, and they work great!", "EDITED TO ADD: If you have a pack with superglue for adhesive, before you apply to underwear, stick it to your leg (including wings) a time or two. It doesn't hurt and it will stick to your underwear, but it won't glue itself on.\n\nWhat happened to this product? The sticky stuff is so strong it tears the pad apart when you try to take it off your underwear. I cannot get the remains off. I have tried to pull it off a bit at a time, but it is like it is attached with superglue. I used to get this product to save my underwear, not to ruin it. (It isn't a good picture, but you get the idea.)", "Great product most of the time but if it's a hot day or pad a little filled up, the bottom liner will adhere to your underwear and cannot be removed unless you soak them. The gel in the pad under that lining falls out and makes quite a mess of wet globules that are hard to clean up.\nProblem is I cannot find a better pad.\nI recommend changing frequently even if you don't have to. But then the cost goes up of course.", "The only thing is that sometimes it bunches up at the edges of pad and the wings part sometimes doesn't stick as well as it should all way through the wing"]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MN5N8H5", "title": "Lithonia Lighting WF6 30K40K50K 90CRI MW M6 LED Color Temperature Selectable Ultra Thin Recessed Downlight, 3000K | 4000K | 5000K, White, 6 inch", "price": "$19\n79", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/514AWYe84JL._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "4,667 ratings", "description": "The 6-inch round Wafer LED Downlight with Switchable White provides high-quality light output and efficiency featuring a switch for easy color temperature adjustment from soft white to neutral white during installation - while eliminating the need for recessed housings.

Good luck!", "Our ceiling is dropped about a foot to make it easy to run wiring and other things so this worked great in that ceiling. Cut a hole, fish some wire to the hole and wire it up. If the ceiling is not dropped, this would not be a good choice of light due to vapor barrier and insulation you should have in the ceiling.", "I am a weekend project warrior. Installed many recessed lights over the years for family and myself. These things take the cake! No more cans up in the ceiling, worrying about insulation contact and sealing right after cutting the hole. Just invest in the proper hole saw and away you go. I even got tricked on one hole with a stringer where I cut the opening. Because these only need 1/2\" of thickness (basically drywall thickness) I was able to install with no headache. The box can be placed up in the ceiling and then you have a twist lock to connect the light to the box. DON'T forget to set your color temperature. The lowest setting is the \"incandescent\" equivalent of about 2700K. They even come with Wago type quick connect for the wires. Highly recommend", "Had to change them out.", "Great product and efficient", "The installation was easy enough after having to bore out the existing hole from the old can lights. Wish the junction box openings included protective covers.\n\nNoticed that the panel gets a bit warm. Bigger heatsinks on the back of the panel would be good to protect the longevity.", "I installed 11 of these over the weekend. I had installed these in a previous home that were fixed at 3000K. I specifically ordered the 2700->3500K adjustable ones because I wanted the flex of going between 3000 and 3500 depending on the room.\n\nFirst, the 3 color selectable seems slightly less bright than the standard 3000K single temp/color light. Maybe 100-150 lumen if i had to guess.\n\nThe other small gripe that I saw from some people: the junction box has a snap inside that keeps it closed. Do not punch a hole in the back of the junction box and leverage it from the bottom. You can punch a hole in the back and push in on the top half, but not bottom.\n\nIf you leverage the bottom, you'll end up warping the box just a tiny bit, but enough so that the latch inside doesn't want to snap shut.\n\nAlso check all of your pre-wired push-in connections. One of the common/white connections on a box pulled out very easily from just handling the wires.", "I put 4 of these in the kitchen on about a four ft square pattern on the lowest of the three settings. Fantastic. There a big improvement. Establish your holes. I used preexisting wiring from the previous centered light. Wired to closest one. Then daisy chained to the other four using the preinstalled clips. Pushing the wires in and pretty much done. Other than placing lights in holes of course. Heald in place by preinstalled spring loaded clamps. Oh and screwing junction box's to joist. Thats also where you brightness selector is. I started with the lowest setting and never looked back. Very happy with them.", "Have 10 in my basement and love them! All on dimmers. Worked well out of the box and look great in an open ceiling in the basement!", "Adjustable brightness is really nice", "I\u2019m an electrician and we install these wafers in every living room, kitchen, master bedroom, and exterior decks on all of our new construction homes. They are so easy to install (4 1/8\u201d holesaw is perfect size\u2026or just trace template and cut out by hand with a jab saw)! Because of their extremely low profile, they can fit almost anywhere! They can even be installed if your home is partially blocked by a truss as long as you can slide the driver in!! They come with soldered ends already in a push-in wire connector making your wire connections an absolute breeze! The color selectable feature is the icing on the cake as it allows us to meet various customer needs depending on their light preference! These are also dimmable, and work flawlessly with a lutron LED dimmer.\n\nA few months ago, our local big box store stopped carrying these. Thankfully our supply houses still had them, despite the markup in price. Sadly, our supply houses don\u2019t carry them anymore either. Apparently there was a buyout and these Lithonias are now made under the \u201cJuno\u201d brand. The Junos not only cost more, but are TERRIBLE quality compared to these!! Flimsy junction box, no push-in connector, less lumen output, quality control with their selectable switches often not working.\n\nWhen I learned these aren\u2019t being made anymore, I quickly snagged some for my personal home to ensure I don\u2019t get stuck with the Junos!! I put a 6\u201d over my showers, 4 4\u201d wafers in my living room, and 5 more for my kitchen.

Spent hours triple checking all the connections and replacing the nuts it came with. Finally got it working again and it was the light to the box plug connection.

Otherwise looks nice and is functioning now.", "I didn't want to give up the vintage recessed lights in my MCM bathroom but they didn't put out much light. I've added these led lights alongside the originals and selected the warmest color temp. The bathroom now has sufficient light to apply makeup. I've also used these in the tub area along with a dimmer - Leviton IllumaTech Slide Dimmer - and I love the result. Dimmed all the way down it creates a spa feel but turned up when I need to see clearly.", "I tried all 3 brands, LIthonia, Juno, and Cloudy Bay based on my preference for 3500k color temp and lumen output. The benefits of the Lithonias are:\n1. Color accurate. At 2700, 3000, and 3500 they were all spot on with what I expected. Next to Juno at 3500 and Cloudy Bay lights, Lithonia was the most color accurate of the 3 outputs it was capable. Followed by Juno and then CB. CB is great if you want 4000k but all others just didn't look right.\n2. Quick Connectors. These have quick connectors that just allow you to insert the wires and go. No twist connectors and makes installation a breeze\n3. Large box. Juno comes in the same size box, but the latch mechanism just didn't hold and would pop out if the wires weren't deep in the box. CB has a smaller box with much less room to work with.\n4. Large spring clamps. The clamps on these were big and allowed the force to spread out more. Good for the drywall applications where the spring clips might damage the dry wall. Juno doesn't come with plastic caps on theirs so you're much more likely to damage. CB came with plastic cabs, but they were shorter and almost excessively strong (and more damaging when I took them out to replace them).\n\nCons: lamp cover doesn't allow much room for error so be sure to get the right hole saw. Juno was the most spacious. CB was on par with Lithonia and left little room for error.\n\nUpdate 7/2021: These do no work well with smart switches. I\u2019ve tested these with Inovelli and GE Enbrighten and the experience has been really poor. Lights flickering", "Great lights and easy to install. Great color from all 3 settings.", "Needed more light over the tubs and showers at the house. Decided that while I was adding new lighting, I would use LEDs for aesthetics & value per lumen. I am tremendously pleased with these fixtures. You can adjust the warmth by three different settings, and they are easy to install.

As a quality alternative to desktop risers, the innovative 42W x 24D Sit to Stand Return offers all the health benefits of a standing desk with the versatility of more expensive electric height adjustable options. The built-in mechanical Lift-n-Lock system allows the desktop to lock into place at standing heights of 35, 38, and 41 inches and easily returns to a seated position. The Return has a counter-balanced design for stability and supports up to 20 pounds when elevated. The 72W x 24D Office Desk includes a file drawer that opens on full-extension ball bearing slides for easy access to legal and letter size documents in addition to a box drawer for supplies and utensils. Both the Desk and Return feature finished backs that allow the L Desk to look great no matter where it's positioned in the room. Wire management grommets are included on both surfaces to keep cords and cables secure and out of sight. Available in your choice of Hansen Cherry, Mocha Cherry, Maple Cross, Ash Gray and Storm Gray finishes with contemporary metal hardware and tapered leg accents, the height adjustable corner desk has an appealing look that works with virtually any decor. Fixed surfaces are tested to meet ANSI/SOHO standards for safety and performance while the mechanical lift system is rigorously tested to Bush Furniture's own quality standards. Backed by a 6 Year Warranty.", "reviews": ["The desk overall is amazing quality. Love the fact that this has several standing settings. The instructions were great but there were a few steps that took us a bit to figure out. We have purchased and built many pieces of furniture so we originally thought 2-3 hours would be enough time to build but it really took 5-6 hours.", "I like the desk, but the file drawer has a broken rail where the file folders are supposed to hang.", "I took a new job that was 100% remote. I had a standing desk at my previous job and wanted that functionality again. I wanted a white desk to go with the design of me new home office and finally found this desk with the raising top built in. It came in two deliveries which allowed me to work from one side for a couple of days. It took my husband and son about 2 hours to out the first part together. A couple of the screws were to tall and didn\u2019t allow the drawers to close. The instructions were okay, not great. My son put the second piece together when it came about two days later. He was able to use what he learned from the first build and had it together in about an hour. I\u2019ve used it now for about a month and really like this desk. It has a ton of workspace even with a very large monitor. I put a couple writing pads on the surface to pretext the top. The standing portion is great. It does push you back about a foot so you need plenty of space behind you to stand and be comfortable in front of the monitor. It is easy to left and put down. I hope it holds up over the next several years. The mechanism for the standing portion doesn\u2019t feel as solid as my old desk but we\u2019ll see.", "This desk was a rare find and just what I was looking for! Took all of the reviews into consideration regarding the assembly and advised my husband that it might take more than 1 day. It comes in 2 boxes. It would have been nice if the sit and stand portions were packed separately. Unfortunately, that's not the case. The first day he just opened it up and went through the instructions. On the second day, he made it happen in a few hours. The desk is sturdy and the 3 standing height options are great for anyone under 6 feet tall. Chose the fresh walnut color before it went up in price. When I placed the order it was one of the few options available in less than 2 months. It took almost 2 months to arrive after getting lost in transit. Absolutely, love this desk and expect to use it for years to come.", "Absolutely love the desk! The size is perfect and the standing desk is perfect. It came in two large, heavy boxes and arrived sooner than expected. It was incredibly easy to assemble. The instructions were straight forward, the pictures were clear, and every piece, including the bags of various screws, were labeled and easy to identify each piece I needed. It was also easy to distinguish within the book whether you wanted the standing desk on the right or left side and how to assemble accordingly. A few pieces were a little heavy to lift, but it was still manageable to assemble without much help. Took me about 4 hours to assemble it myself, but it was well worth it.", "I LOVE this desk! With both right and left hand options and 3 increments on the sit to stand portion we were able to provide our team members with the flexibility they need to be productive. Each unit does take 2 to 3 hours to complete, however if you take the time to lay everything out BEFORE you start building it will make things easier. Also suggest a two person team to build, one as the builder and the other providing instructional guidance and handing the supplies. There are many different types of screws that are used and several are of similar lengths and shape, so if you are unfamiliar with these types of supplies you need to plan accordingly. We had initially hired someone to help build these units and they were having a lot of issues because they were simply trying to look at the pictures. They almost destroyed one of our units because they couldn't follow the written directions. I suggest you read as well as there are pages to skip based on which side you are putting the sit to stand portion.\n\nWe now have 10 of these units in our office and they are amazing. We receive complements from everyone who stops by. They are heavy duty and very sturdy and will last for years to come!", "I love this desk. Yes, it took a few hours to put together. But, that\u2019s understandable, it\u2019s a big deal with lots of pieces. The instructions are incredibly clear and easy to follow. The desk is heavy which is a very good sign for furniture, it\u2019s well-made and brilliantly designed. It looks fantastic and works great! The standup section with the locking intervals and the \u201csoft lowering\u201c are perfect. I have a massive widescreen curved monitor with wireless keyboard and mouse on the standing section and it works perfectly and easily even with all that weight. The drawers provide ample storage and slide well. I wish it had some \u201ccable pass throughs\u201c between the standing section and the return. But, the cables are easy enough to pass under, so not a huge deal. The paperwork listed the manufacturers phone number many times, it was extremely easy to find and although I never had to call them, I felt like if I had, I would have easily gotten the support I needed. The instructions were in perfect English, without even a single misspelling let alone vast amounts of grammatical and punctuation errors had this desk been built non-domestically. I\u2019m extremely happy with this purchase. I\u2019m certain it will last a very long time, it looks fantastic, I would buy it again in a heartbeat and highly recommend it.", "I'm really happy with this desk. It's much nicer than anything available at IKEA, the ash grey laminate looks beautiful in my opinion, and there are extra finishing pieces on the hutch and book shelf that really give it a quality feel. I constructed everything with wood glue and wiped off excess glue with a damp cloth so everything feels very solid and will be good for years to come. All hardware for the handles are very solid and sturdy. The feet of the desk and book shelf are made of plastic, but they look like finished metal. Also, all pieces came a week earlier than Amazon said. The boxes are very heavy and luckily someone was home so they put the boxes in the office and we didnt have to transport. Assembly took me most of the weekend for the shelf, desk, and hutch. I had some help from my wife when I absolutely needed it, mostly to put the hutch on top of the desk. Also, if you buy the hutch, which I recommend because it's beautiful, build and install it after you build the main desk but before the standing L portion of the desk, it will be much easier to install without the standing desk attached in case you need to move it away from the wall. I ended up having to disattach the standing desk to then move the main desk away from the wall to install the hutch. Lastly I was concerned that the hutch and book shelf would be kind of short, but after construction the shelf was actually 64 3/4\" and desk with hutch is 64 1/2\" and both a very nice height. I would definitely buy again and recommend.", "Seeing the \"Standing desk option, I've been looking at this desk for a little more than a year. The price point is acceptable for the product. I do wish that the legs were wood, but they are plastic. Otherwise, it's hard to tell when you look at it.\n\n*It is a good quality piece for the money. Furniture stores using non medium density fiberboard (real wood) will charge you about 3 times this. So, I'm grateful for the option.\n\nIf you have to put it together alone, anticipate about 10 hours (with a couple of breaks and a lunch for yourself built into that time). It is NOT missing the \"L\" brackets... instead, they've placed them in the larger parts bag, I think it was intended to be helpful. Overall, I'm satisfied with my desk. I'm grateful that it was affordable and I can work from home with the needed convenience of the standing desk option.\n\nPlease note. They have a call center that hung up on me when I tried to call about parts, but they hung up on me as I was requesting the part. So be prepared to be on your own. Otherwise, I still think the desk is worth the time, money and effort.", "This isnt the easiest to set up but it is a great desk once complete", "I loved the idea of this desk and being able to stand up during the day if I wanted. Down fall is the drawers are so cheaply made that the file drawer has completely fallen apart and I can\u2019t use it. Took a looooong time to put together and the screws strip very easily. The desk scratches as well very easily. For the price I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product and if I could do the purchase over I would purchase a cheaper desk and but a rider.", "I wanted a sit to stand desk that also had a regular writing area, and L-shaped, and reversible and this product met all those requirements! It came in two separate boxes with two separate instruction manuals. The bigger box completes the 72 inch wide writing desk with two drawers. The slightly smaller box contains the sit to stand part of the desk and all the hardware and mechanisms to support that. Instructions were very clear and thoroughly labeled. Because it is a reversible design, it will tell you to go to certain page numbers to put it together exactly in the direction that you want. There were no missing parts or hardware and everything are off excellent quality. I did not need to drill any additional holes or make any holes bigger or smaller to put this together. The drill tolerances on the pieces were excellent and things just fit together easily.", "Work from home. Very good for this purpose", "Great quality piece that\u2019s heavy and well made. Love the standing feature.", "Some of the pieces were damaged in shipping. Contacted the manufacturer and they quickly sent replacement parts. Manufacturer does stand behind their products.\n\nLot's of parts to assemble, but instructions are great so it's just a matter of follow them step by step.\n\nThe desk looks very nice and feels very robust. Time will tell how well it holds up. But so far so good!", "Staff member needed more workspace and when we saw this one that incorporated stand up - I hit buy now.\nIt was delivered in about 10 days and the staff member for who it was purchased put it together in a couple hours. She - yes I said she - had no issues and is thrilled with her new workspace", "Great desk! Enough space for 2 monitors, a laptop & keyboard on the non standing desk. I get compliments all the time when we have company. I can\u2019t speak to building it since we had someone assembly it. A lot of pieces & it\u2019s a heavy desk!", "Very sturdy, I recommend this product for this price to my family and friends.", "Love this desk! Works perfect for our needs. There is 2 of us that works at the desk and we are both different heights so it is great that it can be raised for our personal needs. Took about 4 hours to put together . Directions gave the option to have the lift desk to be on the right or left which is great! I didn't realize this when I purchased. We have had this for about 1 month now and all seems to be well. There is a small gap between the lift and return as you can see in the pic....but would be nice if it could have been flushed . As we built it we understood why this had to be. That would be my only con about the product.", "The product was delivered about a week ago and we assembled it. It feels sturdy and all looked good, except that it smells! The formaldehyde smell was quite strong. We thought no big deal it would be okay after a few days. We have been leaving the windows open for the room and i have been hiding in a tiny room to get by for about a week now, and it still smells and we start wondering how long it would take to get rid of the smell, or whether it would go away totally.\n\nAt this point we really want to return it but don't know how, given it's all assembled and we no longer have the original packages. It's really a bummer that this manufacture doesn't use quality materials to build the products. This is the first time I got furnitures with such strong smell in more than 20 years, although to be fair usually i dont get furnitures on amazon. but this piece wasn't inexpensive so i really expected it to be made of better stuff."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MVH78DP", "title": "Diapers Size 1, 44 Count - Pampers Baby Dry Disposable Baby Diapers, Jumbo", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51jXbX3Z0uL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "ratings": "15 ratings", "description": "Designed to help keep skin dry and healthy, Pampers Baby-Dry diapers feature LockAway Channels to absorb wetness and lock it away from skin for up to 12 hours of dryness.

I A-B'd the Sony with the LG OLED's down at the local B***B** and it's not close. For movies, it's Sony all the way.\n\nAs for my purchase experience. I had some stress. I'd been sweating an OLED tv for years. Big movie buff. Wanted to get the right one. And even more so - did not want to get a lemon! Everyone's two dreaded words...\n\n\"Vertical banding\"\n\nOMGWTFBBQOLEDSENDHELP!!!!!1ONE\n\nExpectations:\n\nPeople buying an OLED tv should be aware that there is some variability in the consistency of the OLED panels. It would be great if Sony, LG, or whoever would test them before shipping them out and save consumers the hassle of ordering the tv, shipping it (or bringing it home), unboxing it, and discovering for themselves that they've received a sub-par panel... But they don't. They will also tell you that a certain amount of \"texture\" is to be expected. It really isn't. Not an amount that a normal person can detect while watching normal UHD content. It's true that some vertical texture will be present in most panels if you really look hard enough, and that said texture will likely improve or blend to some degree over time... I would not recommend doing a panel eval test right out of the box and squinting at it to see if any vertical texture can be perceived. It WILL be. That's not what we're talking about here. There's a great Reddit thread - give it a read.\n\nBut on SOME panels, there will be OBVIOUS vertical banding, right out of the box. Banding that interrupts normal viewing. This is NOT normal, and should not be accepted. These TVs should be returned while they are still within the return period. On our first panel, the banding was clearly apparent right on the setup screen, and bled through every type of content. By fiddling with the brightness and contrast settings, I was able to mitigate that condition to a degree, but not sufficiently to make the quality of the display truly competitive with the traditional LED tv it was replacing. Clearly (no pun intended) this wasn't correct. Recognizing that I'd received a sub-par panel, I contacted Amazon to begin the exchange.\n\nSurprise! No exchange! NO BIG DEAL!\n\nI set up the return for the first tv, which had an insane grace-period. This was the middle of October - Amazon insisted I send it back by the end of January. Can you believe the nerve. I also ordered the replacement tv to make sure I didn't lose out on the deal.. It came two days later.\n\nSo, having the two tvs side-by-side, it took less than 10 seconds to confirm that the first panel was defective. The second panel was basically perfect, right out of the box. No, I didn't run a test-sequence on it.. But in all the ways the first panel was obviously flawed, the second panel obviously wasn't. So the first one went back in the box (like I mentioned - super easy) and off it went to UPS. Done deal.\n\nSo, in conclusion, or tl;dr.. If you get a panel that isn't giving you good picture quality for normal content, don't wait to see if it gets better. These tvs should look good out of the box. Send it back and get one that does. My second tv is AWESOME. LOVE IT.", "I\u2019m absolutely in love with the Sony A8G OLED, and I wish I would have went with Sony for OLED instead of LG\u2019s OLED. There are something\u2019s that LG does better than Sony, but all in all the Sony is a powerhouse compared to LG.\n\nWhen I was setting up the Sony, I noticed almost immediately that the picture settings where more customizable than my LG E8P OLED. The one setting I really liked and wish LG would have implemented was the gradient smoothing feature. I watch a lot of scary movies, and one thing I hate is seeing any sort of color banding. Turning on this feature will remove some of the fine details in the picture, however I am willing to sacrifice this in order to see a more smooth and natural picture.\n\nSo when comparing with my LG, and current LG OLEDs I noticed that LG is brighter in comparison. Because LG OLEDs are also brighter, Sony\u2019s color volume is also not as high as LG OLEDs, but LG\u2019s OLED color volume isn\u2019t as great as Samsung QLED. The reason for this is because OLEDs use a white sub-pixel and that desaturates pure colors at high brightness levels. LG are also slightly more future proofed. LG has implemented HDMI 2.1 and eARC on all their 2019 OLEDs, and last year all had full HDMI 2.0 support. Where as the only one that has full HDMI 2.0 is the Sony A9G OLED. The Sony A8G only has full HDMI 2.0 support is HDMI 2 and 3 which is okay, but unfortunately the 3 is also the ARC and if you plan on plugging in a sound bar via HDMI and using the ARC for that... you\u2019ll only have one HDMI that supports the full bandwidth.\n\nI also like the LG motion remote, and their WebOS platform where I need to learn how to use the Sony\u2019s Android platform. This isn\u2019t terrible, it\u2019s just a platform that I will have to get use to.\n\nWhere Sony really comes above LG is their picture processor is phenomenal. I watched and compared the TV with the LG E8P OLED I have and I could notice that Sony not only had better motion handling, but also appeared more sharper and the color looked natural.\n\nHonestly, if I could go back in time I would have told myself to spend the extra for the Sony OLED. It\u2019s great, and it won\u2019t disappoint.", "Had the Samsung ks8500, 55 inch and have loved it in my movie room and was extremely happy with it, but was able to find the A8G, 65 inch for around $1499.00 on Amazon so I couldn't pass it up!\n\nIt was a great picture out of the box, but I tinkered with it a little and it looks amazing. The colors are great and the HDR is awesome. I use it mostly for movies and run a older Panasonic 4k ub9000 blu ray player which doesn't have dolby vision but the picture is awesome. The upscaling is also very good... regular blu-rays look almost as good as 4k blu-rays and may even be a bit brighter.\nThe tv is a little dim but I expected that going in, and the room I have it in is dark, so it isn't a a problem at all... i had to turn the backlighting on my ks8500 down to less than half but this tv, I have it as bright as possible. In addition, I can't tell much of a difference in sharpness bt the A8G and the ks8500 but I'm sure that has to do with the pixel density or something since the A8G is bigger...\nBy the way, it goes without saying with an OLED, it has some really deep blacks. Although not quite the difference I was expecting bt it and the ks8500... it is noticeable though. However, I haven't put them side by side so I'm sure I'd see a huge difference if I did.\nI'm sure most people have moved on to the A8H but if you can find the A8G for under $1800.00, I'd grab it (especially if it's for a dark room - if you have a lot of windows in the room I'd go with QLED or another LED). Plus, I've heard that this model allows for more adjustments in picture settings that the A9G and the A8H don't allow.", "Have had this TV for a couple of weeks now, and I am very satisfied with the product. It is set approximately 10-12 feet from the seating area, and consistently has beautiful picture. I have Xfinity, FireTV, a Sony 4K player, and Xbox One all hooked up to it. I used Monster HDMI cables for each hookup when necessary. Picture quality is amazing for all four (note that Xfinity scales to 1080 for much of the time). I have not streamed true SD quality movies yet, but I suspect they will still look adequate. Blu-Ray movies do look great, and 4K disks look fantastic. Given that most of the FireTV features are also available through the TV\u2019s built in android functions, I also tested those. Each of the apps that I have used have had beautiful picture quality and zero errors setting up or streaming content. For reference my wireless internet speeds are 220 down and 11 up. Gaming has been perfect, though I have not tested with a game such as Rock Band where lag would need to be assessed. Setup of the TV was very easy with no issues. I should have research it more before buying, because it has much greater capability with the Google Play Store and other apps than I knew when I purchased. Happy surprise.\n\nCons:\nI have noticed that the TV interface can be just a little slow at times. When using accessory remotes such as for the FireTV or Xfinity, response is even a little slower for the TV commands (volume, etc.) or do not have full functionality (xfinity arrow keys when choosing input, etc.). All of this is still manageable for my purposes. I do wish the TV remote was backlit, and that I had a little more forgiveness for aiming it at the TV sensor. Sometimes I don\u2019t point the remote accurately enough for the signal to be received.\n\nOverall it\u2019s a great TV that my wife and I have been very happy with as we watch it every night.", "I've never bought a TV via shipping before, preferring to have something delivered and setup by a store service. Well I ordered this TV from Amazon and was pleasantly surprised at how easy it's become, partly because these things are much lighter and smaller than the old days of rear-projection, etc.\n\nThough a little fragile feeling due to the thin top portion, I felt confident in lifting it to my stand by myself and attaching it to the base. If I had a helper around, I probably would have utilized an extra pair of hands mostly to steady the TV while attaching it to the stand.\n\nOnce physically in place, the ports are very well labeled and hookup is a breeze especially since I'm only using an Apple 4kTV box connected to HDMI-2. First tried HDMI-1, but it would not support HDR or Dolby Vision. Must be a lower speed input I guess. Anyway, move the HDMI cable to HDMI-2 and voila, full HDR or Dolby Vision now supported. Note that with all the built-in apps, I could have just enjoyed this TV with no external source.\n\nThe built-in speakers are actually pretty good - by far the best TV sound I've ever heard, but it's not good enough for music in my opinion. I used the Optical Audio output connected to a 10-year old Yamaha receiver in plain old stereo mode driving a pair Definitive Technology speakers. Now we're talking!\n\nPicture quality is great, though I ultimately settled on 4k SDR from my Apple TV box rather than any HDR, Dolby setting. I found those options just too bright (blacks weren't quite black) on some material. This may be an Apple or interface cable issue, because I do like the look of Dolby Vision from the internal apps, like Netflix, etc.", "My old TV had a $200 Yamaha sound bar. Tried it with this TV, but the built-in surface sound is so much better than the sound bar that the sound bar went off to another TV (another Sony Bravia, but much older). When I say the picture is stunning, I mean that. I actually tuned down both the initial brightness and color saturation settings to something I was more comfortable with. What is funny is that even in high-production-value TV shows (say Big Bang Theory) you can suddenly see when the lighting is slightly off and that the actors are acting. What I'm saying is that the clarity is whole different level from 1080. I can watch it from a couch 11 feet away and not feel like I have to move closer, but if I do move closer, still a great picture.\n\nUPDATE: Start up after turning the set on is flawed after a month or so. The Sony logo no longer appears; from a cold start, the sound comes on in 10 seconds but the picture comes on anywhere between 1.5 to 3.5 minutes later. (If the set is already \"warm\" the picture comes on right away, although still no Sony logo.) So, tried resetting the TV, but that doesn't help. This is my fourth Sony Bravia and this is the first problem I've ever had. On to Sony tech support...\n\nUPDATE 2: If you have this kind of problem, call the Sony Support number. (Don't bother with the website.) They were pretty good and after a few days (because I couldn't check to see if the settings adjustments helped until the next morning), they identified a hardware problem. A technician came to my house and replaced the main board about a week later. All under warranty. Now everything is back to the original normal great quality TV.", "This has been the greatest tv I've bought yet in my life. It's taken me so long to write a review just because I've been too busy using it.\n\nTo get started with the picture quality, what can I say besides the fact that it's absolutely gorgeous. The OLED blacks and fantastic natural colorand scaling makes an experience that cannot be replicated anywhere else.\n\nThis is honestly the first time where I've been completely happy with the picture on the tv. I usually always find something that will eat away at me until I have to replace it; even the C9 I had always felt a bit off. This tv though I have none of that feeling with.\n\nEvery single image I've seen on it has just been immaculate, it might be the first tv I've bought that I don't replace within a year.\n\nI've also been converted into a believer in the acoustic surface sound. It's just so clear and detailed, I rarely even use my Z9F soundbar unless I want to get Atmos from my Xbox one and even then the tv sound directly often still sounds more pleasing to my ears.\n\nHonestly the only downsides to the tv are two minor things.\n1. All the HDMI ports aren't full bandwidth (I know it's a method to upsell to X1 Ultimate tvs but there's no reason to nickel and dime the ports this way, especially in 2019)\n\n2. The input lag while good is not as good as on X1 ultimate sets (I can forgive this one since the X1 extreme is really the middle child in terms of processing power so there is some expected drawback from it's advanced processing?\n\nFinal take: if you can get passed those small issues, this tv will probably be one of the best sets you can ever own.", "When we decided to open up a creative coffee shop, we wanted to feature the work of other creators. We needed a TV with superior image quality, a fast processor for streaming videos and the ability to cast for workshops. We reached out to Sony and were fortunate enough to receive the Sony XBR-65A8G 65in.\n\nThe first thing we noticed was the outstanding picture quality. The 4k OLED brings out the true color in the images. And unlike most TVs, you can actually see different shades of black. The color gradients were sharp and even more vibrant \u2013 the Triluminos display did not disappoint. As a photographer, we really appreciate being able to show off the details and dynamic range of our images.\n\nThroughout the day, we like to stream our favorite photography channels and display photo slide shows on the TVs. Having the ability to sync and stream from our favorite apps with no lag was a must for us. Customers that rent out space also need to cast Power Points and Keynotes straight from their Android/iPhones/computers. Being able to do so wirelessly is a huge selling point for us to attract and retain business.\n\nAnd last but not least, the styling and look for the TV is impressive. It just looks great, its OLED screen is super thin and it\u2019s a striking piece on the wall. The mounts on the TV are universal and we were able to hang it very quickly and easily. The sound quality was also surprisingly good \u2013 no need for external speakers!\n\nOverall, we were extremely impressed with the image quality and speed. For those of us who value picture quality and versatility, I would highly recommend this TV. It\u2019s an ideal choice for creators who want to show off the true beauty of their work on a large display.", "This TV is decent for gaming and watching Blu Rays, but beware that you will have massive issues steaming Dolby Vision movies and tv shows. So if you buy this TV to watch the newest episodes of House of the Dragon, think again. Won\u2019t work. The tint will constantly change between light and dark, orange and blue and green.\n\nSony has known about this for years and they will only direct customers to online guides for completely unrelated issues. They have yet to fix the issue or to allow an option to switch off Dolby Vision.\n\nDo NOT waste your money on this television. It\u2019s too expensive to have such a massive oversight, and I very much regret buying it.", "Love the TV!\nDon't love the cost..\n\nThe picture is amazing, and the upscaling is great, and the the picture options are user friendly and effective.\n\nIf you worry about a smart TV acquiring something bad from the internet, this TV allows you to turn the Wifi off, which I did after updating the android software to 8.0\n\nHighly recommended if you can afford it!!\n\nUpdate: 2/7/20\n\nThe TV is still awesome, and I figured out that you should raise all of the motion options to their maximum in order to get the best motion clarity. It seems obvious but I didn't do it until I had the TV for a few months. The custom option allows you to raise the \"smoothness\" option to its maximum.\n\nI've also found myself using the apps for online services like Netflix and Amazon prime allot, which is convenient because there are separate buttons for them on the remote. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nUPDATE: 8/12/20\nTV is still amazing. No problems, and I watch it allot! Many many many hours.", "Hands-down the best TV I've owned. I had it out of the box and setup in about 15 mins. It is incredibly light and the remote is intuitive. The picture is superb and - best of all - it is easy to adjust to shift between high-def motion for sports and then shift out of soap opera effect for movies and TV shows (which was an absolute must-have when switching from my old Panasonic plasma). There's picture-in-picture included and the TV sound is excellent.\n\nIf I could make one improvement, it would be with the remote, to where it could be configured to my cable box. There is an included IR-Blast wired solution, where you attach IR nodes to your box and plug the other end into the TV. This doesn't work if you're cable box is not immediately close to the TV. So, I'm 2-remotes-guy again. Still, that's one small detail I can live with. You could also purchase an aftermarket universal remote.", "What a fantastic oled tv. Picture quality is great, colors are amazing and realistic, and blacks are fantastic. I added the Vizio V21 sound bar and helped to amp up the sound quality. I can\u2019t say good enough things about the picture quality of this tv. I thought I\u2019d have buyer\u2019s remorse for paying so much for a tv, but I have none at all. I am enjoying the tv too much. The screen is not super bright but good enough for daytime watching, gaming on Xbox and PS4 work fine, and the tv draws you in when watching movies at night. My family now watches a show together every night and we are all amazed at how its like being in a theater.", "The TV has a great picture and sound and was easy for us non techies to set up. We do not game on it. I do have to say our TV developed a flaw in the picture within the first week. After a lengthy and extensive troubleshooting call with Sony customer service, they agreed the TV was malfunctioning and arranged to deliver us a new set and remove the other one. That process went smoothly. The replacement set works great and we are very happy with it. I do wonder, I bought a high end Sony camera and this TV and they both broke and had to be replaced shortly after purchase. What is happening to Sony quality control?", "Amazing TV picture and quality. For the price I couldn\u2019t beat it. I dropped down from a 75\u201d 1080p to this Sony 65\u201d 4K tv and couldn\u2019t be happier. It\u2019s super crisp and the viewing angles are fantastic. Want a better picture? Get it calibrated but you won\u2019t be disappointed if you don\u2019t. As for sound? It\u2019s fine but I have mine hooked up to a sound bar/subwoofer and enjoy that better. Hopefully the Apple TV app shows up on an upgrade in the future. I also bought an LED light strip for the back of it and I highly recommend that.", "I love this TV, Picture is fantastic, I have large windows on the opposite wall with almost no glare, which is what I was looking for. I had it narrowed down to this one or an LG and I choose this one due to it suppose to be less glare, sturdy screen, and still one of the best TVs. It was all of these, I was upgrading from a TV bought long ago also a Sony, I hope this one will last just as long. I have had it for 5 months and very happy with my purchase.", "We purchased a Sony after Samsung refused to honor their warranty for our previous TV. We\u2019re still trying to figure this one out. We like the size, not too heavy, and crisp picture. However, the remote is the crappiest thin EVER. Saying we hate the remote is putting it lightly, lacks functionality and we haven\u2019t figured out yet if it is a TV design flaw or the crappy remote but you literally have to be right in front of the TV for the signal to be received to change channels, volume, etc...Time will tell if we ditch the cheap remote and get an all in one remote for our TV and components...", "I have some fairly decent TVs in my home but none of them OLED, QLED or Nanocell. I decided to go all out for my husband\u2019s birthday and get the Sony OLED. I went to Best Buy and got advice bc this TV had zero reviews on Amazon and it\u2019s $2,000. Everyone at Best Buy said the Sony OLED is the best TV money can Buy. They gave me a bunch of facets I didn\u2019t understand about true blacks and the built in soundbar, etc. look I\u2019m just a female who wanted the best TV by far for my husband. The \u201cwow\u201d TV. I will have to discuss more w him and give an update but I\u2019m not so \u201cwowed\u201d. It\u2019s a nice tv, big, flat, thin, nice picture. But nothing extraordinary. If I could do it again I would NEVER spend $2,000 on this TV. I don\u2019t see why it\u2019s worth $2,000. I would love to compare it to the LG OLED and the Samsung QLED. Maybe then I would think more of this Sony OLED. Sorry Sony and sorry Amazon.", "I am usually a Samsung Girl for TVs...So... I needed a new tv for living room. Seeing as Samsung do not make or sell, OLED only QLED which I gather is a variation of LED as far as I can see and relies on back lit screens that burn out quicker and on mass which I have experienced with our 4yr old Samsung 65 inch. . After a lot of soul searching, cause it ain\u2019t cheap, reading reviews and learning about best picture quality.. I purchased the 65 inch SONY BRAVIA OLED 4K ULTRA HD SMART TV. I can\u2019t tell you how happy I am and how stunning the picture is... so impressive, immersive. Sony is not wrong when they claim the deepest black and natural colors bring the screen to life, OMG, can\u2019t take my eyes off 4K movies and programming, even regular tv looks brilliant.. Nice job Sony. Thanks so much.\nBTW I never write reviews.", "The picture settings are the best on the market since the newer models take out some of those features such as clarifying and auto adjust picture to 2020.BTV.\nThe remote control is the cheap plastic but I have a higher quality universal remote, one annoying thing is the infrared sensor on the tv to receive commands from the remote, if it\u2019s blocked you won\u2019t be able to put in commands.", "I purchased a 2019 Samsung Q7 and its associated sound bar. First, the TV picture quality was not great, and the build quality was questionable, Smart Things integration was spotty (?!) and the Alexa integration did not work at all. Second, the sound bar was mediocre and did not connect to the TV reliability -- like really? -- same brand? -- and only 1 HMDI input? Sent it back and purchased the 55A8G OLED Sony with the associated Sony sound bar -- cost an additional $100 at the time. Much better! Picture quality much much better! Sound bar integrates perfectly with the TV, integration with Alexa actuality works with the TV too. Sound bar also works with well Alexa, and has multiple HDMI and other various inputs.

Now I don\u2019t know how many hours ppl have been leaving their babies in the diapers but I\u2019ve did 3-4 hours just to test it out for overnight before we did overnight. They worked just fine and didn\u2019t leak but got really mushy but no leak so these are a winner for me. I\u2019m going to order a box since this small test run was pretty good to me, so this was most definitely worth the money.", "They leaked and I did not like the feel of them.

While I prefer a more premium diaper for the baby\u2019s first year, after that, I like to go budget. A few years had passed since we used Luvs and I am happy with the change. The new box feels so much softer (not that loud crinkly sound Luvs used to make) and also it seemed like they toned down the \u201cbaby powder scent\u201d A LOT! Which is a huge plus. Overall, I love the new change and we will once again be using Luvs until we potty train", "Amazing leak protection!

I actually have 2, purchased at separate times to ensure I was happy with it. It really helps make my upstairs temperatures far more bearable in the summer. I am in Atlanta, it is hot and extremely humid. I was concerned that I would need to drain these due to the humidity and I've had them for 3 months and not needed to at all (only using the cool setting not the dry).\nConnecting to my wifi and my Google smart home was quick and easy. I love that I can set routines to start cooling before I plan to be in these rooms. I highly recommend starting the unit at least an hour before you need it when it's really hot out. It says 64 degrees, my rooms have never gotten that cold but they can get down to a chilly 67 after several hours of running. It does make a difference in my power bill but it's not any more than I would have if I was using my central AC and cooling my whole home.\nThe beeping from changing settings is annoying but I was able to open up the unit and remove the beeper with the help of a handy friend. When they are running they are loud but they become white noise. I am able to leave it on when I am on work calls and it's only 4ft from me. When sleeping I enjoy the white noise.\nI whole heartily recommend these units.\nOne note is I did need a saw to cut the window flashing down to size but that was an easy fix.", "Pros: -Good cooling ability\n-Quieter than other units\n-Smarthome integration works well\n-Window installation kit is great\n\nCons: -Lights and beeps\n-Smart software setup could be easier\n\nI really like this portable AC unit. This is the 2nd one I've owned, I have one in 2 rooms to save energy in the rooms I spend the most time in instead of cooling the whole house. The other one is a Honeywell 10,000 BTU unit that was about $75 more. The 10k unit is definitely stronger and can bring down a room's temperature faster, but the trade off for that power is the noise level. This unit is quieter but not quite as strong. It is also cheaper and has the smart home feature which is literally the main reason I chose it. If you have a larger bedroom you can sleep with it on the far side of the room, but my room is very small and its right next to my bed, so I use earplugs.\n\nIt took probably a full hour to get the device operating from my phone and hooked into google assistant. The instructions were ok, but they could be better. With assistant you'll need the HE Smart app. I have to say I love controlling this thing from my phone instead of using a remote, and you can set on/off timers to days of the week using the default app which works very good. Assistant can turn the device on/off using routines.\n\nThe thing beeps every on/off and when you change settings, which is fine but gets annoying when you set a timer for 2am and it beeps when it kicks off. Also the lights on this thing are excessive. The wifi light will stay on 24/7 which isnt a big deal, but the unit has internal lights (for making it pretty) that display on the case cover. It looks cool, but its dumb if you want to sleep in the same room. I put tape over all the led's and a t-shirt over the case so all the lights are blocked.\n\nAlso the window kit is wayyy better than the one I got with the honeywell unit. It comes with alot of weather stripping, the hose is better made, and the plastic is thicker.\n\nSummary: I think this is a really good unit for the price. It cools great and the smarthome works really good. You can see it is a well designed device that they put effort into and were thinking ahead of the curve. A couple nitpicks could be changed, but I am veyr happy with it", "It's not the greatest, but it's not bad. I bought this for my bedroom and it does an extremely good job cooling the room down no matter how hot it gets outside (my central air, unfortunately, does not have a vent in the bedrooms - something I plan to eventually address but purchased this in the meantime). I have two complaints that people have probably already brought up.\n\nFirst, the lights on the display are extremely bright, like television level bright. I've got mine covered and don't use the device's controls (I only control it with the app, which actually works pretty well). Second, the device can be a little loud when the compressor kicks on and off.\n\nIf those two things aren't dealbreakers, which they aren't for me, then I do recommend this. I haven't used the dehumidifier option though, so I can't comment on how well that works versus a dedicated, standalone dehumidifier.", "Though I received a different model from the seller than the Amazon description listed, it was still an Emerson Quiet Kool with similar specs to those listed. BUYER BEWARE however, the window slider kit with the model I received (EAPC5RSC1) does not extend to the listed measurement of 50\". It only came with two slider panels with overall length of 38\". Since my window is 46\" I now have to purchase a new window slider kit for about $40. Also, the slider panels are of a poor design and only had one tiny plastic peg to secure the set length on one side. This makes it very wobbly in a vertical window since you can't secure both sides of the slider. Overall, this unit is one of the quietest I've heard and cools a large room well, but be aware there are multiple options being sold under one listing - hard to know exactly which one you are ordering.", "This is a great portable air conditioner! It cools down my 121sqft home office 7-10 degrees after running a while. It has great controls & a useful remote control. It blows pretty well even on the low fan speed. It has 3 fan speeds & an auto fan. It has 3 modes- Cool, Fan, Dehumidifier. It also has a timer. It evaporates water on cool so it doesn\u2019t need emptied very often. I don't think it has a sleep mode- but you could just put it on low fan speed. The noise level is much quieter than the older LG model I had which you had to shout over to have a conversation- had to be at least 80db or higher. I measured the noise decibel levels of this one and it was on low 3ft & 9ft away= 53db, high- 3ft & 9ft away= 55db. So high and low fan speed are not much different in terms of sound levels. So it's very quiet. It\u2019s very easy to set up and get working. The only issue I had was I could not use the phone or Alexa app as the app says it\u2019s not available in my country/region. I live in Ohio in the USA- so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s like this in all of the states. I don\u2019t really need that feature anyway. It also does not have an \u201ceco\u201d mode or automatic shut-off when it reaches the temperature you want-which I was hoping for. But overall I\u2019m very satisfied with my purchase & I highly recommend!", "I keep a towel over the top lights because they glow in they dark. I am not sure if this affects the temperature control sensor but it stops working sometimes. I have to switch it back to dehu and then back to cool to snap it out and also if you hit the program hours it is impossible to clear it so I want to block the remote from having those buttons work because I wake up and it is off due to hitting a 1 hour button. That is annoying. The buttons are PITA style but overall it is quiet. I leave the room and cant hear it in the next room. My other one was much louder. I am pleased that it is quieter.", "It's not very noisy, after a few minutes I don't even notice it on. Comes with a remote which is nice and if you loose that you can download an app that you can connect the AC to that will allow you to turn it on and off, control fan speed and change the temperature. Basically every the remote can do, the app can do. You can also hook this to your Alexa and ask her to turn it in and off, change temperature and speed as well as change modes. It does an amazing job at cooling down larger spaces. I love in a small apartment and it cools down the living room and the entrance room. We've actually had to turn it off a few times because it got pretty cold. The only con was attaching the vent hose to the machine and to the window vent. It took me a while to get it to stay on.", "Several record-hot days in Pacific Northwest and this kept master bedroom cool and comfy with door closed. Def stick to recommended room sizes, I didn\u2019t try to get it to cool a larger area. LOUD when ac function kicks in and while it\u2019s on. But did sleep at night regardless. It\u2019s not quiet. Remote has no lighting so you can\u2019t use it in the dark.", "I ordered 2 Portable Air Conditioner(SereneLife, Costway) before getting this one. This is indeed the quietest one. Other two's compressor were making rattling noise but Emerson Quiet Kool SMART is really quiet. It's cooling power could be better, but for me noise is a prime factor. No 5 starts because the cooling power is bit lesser I feel but is adequate for me.", "This is an AMAZING portable air conditioner. The quiet cool refers to it being a lot quieter than traditional window units. It is delivered quickly, safely and intact with every piece that you need. Setting up the window piece may take some time, like all window units do, making sure you\u2019re using the foam and sticky foam that is provided. Nonetheless, that was the only draw back is that it took a little time to just get it set up. This comes with a remote, as well as you can control it from your WiFi! Controlling it from bed, what luxury! The different functions are nice, as you can have it on auto and sleep which makes the unit even quieter. Cools the down stairs very nicely. Great unit, would definitely recommend.", "I purchased this specifically for the wi-fi capabilities. The app (HE Smart) doesn't exist in the Apple Store. I have a husky and a bedroom that gets fairly hot in the afternoon. I needed an air conditioner that I could control while I'm not home. Unfortunately, the description indicates that you can control this air conditioner with a smartphone. As of June 2, 2021, that's not true for iPhone. Not even when you scan the app download QR code that comes with the user manual. Sometimes if makes a very loud noise when you turn it on. I\u2019ve found that turning it off and turning it back on again gets rid of the noise. Mine came with the bottom of the box missing, so returning it has been a hassle.\n\nEdit: For the past few days I\u2019ve noticed a decline in the unit\u2019s cooling ability. I drained the AC and cleaned the filter but it didn\u2019t fix the issue. The AC doesn\u2019t respond when I change the fan settings from low to high. I\u2019ve set the AC unit to 64\u00b0 F. It\u2019s been running for hours yet my room is 78\u00b0. Still haven\u2019t been able to return it because of the box. At this point, I\u2019d encourage everyone to avoid this product. Tomorrow is supposed to be 97\u00b0 outside. I have a husky who I have to leave at home. With no wifi capability, I can\u2019t control the air conditioner and now I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t my bedroom while I\u2019m gone.", "Excellent! Glad I got this. Worth the investment. Works with Alexa. And the app on my phone in case I'm away and need to adjust settings for when I get home. Has many helpful features.

For a budget phone this is an awesome phone but honestly Samsung is rolling their A series with a slight screen defect. Now I know there is an obvious firmware issue with most of them and it can be a simple fix but for free starting holding the power down and volume down rocker button and making sure that you have plenty of charge on your battery so you can revive your supposed black screen problem. I am sure most of the time that's all the issue is in my case I was the one unlucky individual who received one brand new out of the package device that worked perfectly for 24 hours then failed having a black screen of death that could not be resolved through this simple restart. I'm not saying this is not a good phone because it is you just have to be mindful that if you are one of those individuals who receive one and it doesn't work you might get lucky knowing that it might just be the firmware issue, if not then you're the very unlucky one and it gets a defective screen where there's nothing you can do other than send it back hoping for a good replacement A series phone. Don't let my review stop you from buying one Samsung is a really good brand and you have to remember they're pushing out phones quicker than we can count so something's bound to go wrong somewhere and Amazon in my opinion is your greatest option when buying a new phone as long as its under prime protection so that if you are the unlucky and unfortunate individual Amazon has your back. So with that said the only thing you have to worry about it's possibly getting one that rolls out the bad screen otherwise I would have submitted a 5-star review. I hope this review helps you find what you were looking for.", "I've had this phone for over a year and I feel comfortable telling everyone my thoughts. Before this phone I had a Nokia smart phone with finger print scanner and all those fancy features. The problem why I left that phone is because the connection port was loose and wouldn't charge. I had that phone for less than 6 months and was nervous buying another phone. I want to note that I use straight talk and I use the nano sim card. Anyway, I spent a lot of time researching phones and was hesitant to purchase due to the low cost. I had a galaxy s7 before the Nokia and it still works perfectly, the only problem is that the battery only lasts about 3 hours fully charged. This phone is the cheap or basic model from the galaxy family. Well let me tell you it doesn't look or feel like it. This thing competes with all the new phones with fingerprint and face recognition. The only thing I hate is that it doesn't have wireless charging but not a huge downside. I don't game on it, sometimes Among Us but that's it. I do edit pictures and videos for Instagram and Facebook and it keeps up just fine. The only thing I really care about is battery performance. I hate having to charge a phone more than 3 times in one day. It's been a year and the battery still lasts me almost 2 days with minimum use. I usually charge it when I am at work around 9am and I charge it again the next day at the same time with still 40% left. Overall this is a steal. I'm happy I purchased this phone. I knew Samsung was a great phone company and they still haven't disappointed me.", "My previous phone had been a Galaxy S4, so obviously I'm not the type that has the latest and greatest tech. But if you are like me, and just needed a smart phone with a good camera and that let you browse Auntie May's status and upload your latest selfie to Insta, and maybe do some shopping on Amazon while waiting at the DMV, this is a great phone for you. I'm not a spec expert, and other reviewers have covered that.\nI've only had the phone a few days, but I'm really happy with it. When I powered it on, it allowed me to select the language, although the very first screen was in Spanish, it was super easy to change. I had already made sure any photos, videos, and documents I wanted to move to my new phone were saved on my SD card, and I exported my contacts to my SD card as well. I found out that my old SIM card was too large, this phone needs a mini SIM (It accepts 2 mini SIM cards). A new SIM card costs around 5 bucks. ATT would have mailed one to me but I had errands to run anyway so I went to the store, which was great because they went ahead and updated their system with the new phone. If you do it yourself at home, you will need the IMEI number, which since this phone has 2 SIM card options, there are 2 numbers. SIM 1 is the middle slot. You can look up your IMEI numbers in the settings, under the \"\"About Phone\" option. My IMEI number for the SIM 1 was also printed on the outside of the package, but you'll want to double check it or you might have an issue with your phone getting on your provider's network. This was the main thing that seemed unusual compared to other phones I've activated in the past. Anyway, so far the speed and functionality of the phone seem to be great, and the camera is WAY better than my old phone, so I'm a happy camper!", "I have a Galaxy S10+ issued from work, so I will compare the two for a better reference. I dont game, and my uses are usually fairly basic. Occasionally, I might have to do some multi-app processing, but my use is usually just web browsing, equipment-specific control apps, and the usual phone stuff.\n\nThat being said, I really like this phone. I like it more than the S10+.\n\nThe fingerprint reader on the S10+ can be maddening and is often unusable. It also takes longer to unlock the phone. The one on the A20 has been nothing but reliable, and is so much faster to unlock the phone.\n\nFor normal use, the difference between the two is not even noticable. Once again, I don't game.\n\nThe drawbacks are the screen resolution, and the video output and screen casting.\n\nThe screen resolution of the A20 is not nearly as good, so fine detail is out the window. I do have to zoom pages to read small print on occasion.\n\nI have yet to get the A20 to put video out of the USB-C with an adapter. The S10+ works like a champ with an adapter.\n\nThe screen casting also leaves a lot to be desired with the A20. It does *work,\" but it is very glitchy. Glitches every five seconds or so, making any real watching impossible.\n\nFor basic use, this phone is excellent. For more robust features, you'd probably want to take a few steps up.", "Un telefono que no tiene nada que envidiarle a los Samsung serie S, es de excelente operatividad, resistente, en pocas palabras es uno de los mejores tel\u00e9fonos que he tenido", "This is now my daily driver, and I use it for calls and texting, YouTube, and...Minecraft.

I have been an Apple user for 6ish years - generally going for their \"budget\" phones (used iPhone 4, then the iPhone SE) - this thing smokes those phones as far as bang for the buck.\n\nThere is something about paying less than $200 for a great smartphone. It isn't the best at everything - my biggest complaint would be you can feel a slight 'slog' with the limited RAM at times, but it is an incredible phone for the price. If I get 2+ years out of this, I will feel like I'm getting paid to use it.\n\nIt was shockingly easy to set up - (I was surprised going from Apple to Android) - and the ability to buy a micro SD card to increase storage is insane! Apple wants you to think that 64 gb of data should cost $300. This is so stupid. Screw Apple and their overpriced mediocrity.\n\nThis phone doesn't have the best camera, but it is a solid option for photos and video. I even made some YouTube videos with this (search \"The Doooskeys\" and you can find them easily) and they came out better than expected.\n\nI will be looking for another phone in this line the next time I need to buy a phone.", "This is the 2nd phone I've purchased in the same number of weeks. I bought one for my wife and I loved the feel and looks of it. The camera is great. Not exactly sure what a dual front camera does, but the pictures are very clear. It took a little work to adjust to the interface. The apps are hidden and have to be brought out, but once I found out how to add them to the main pages, it works good. The only issue I have is the fingerprint reader is not as good, but I believe it is my fingerprints that are the problem as I have the same problem with other readers that I have used. I like the dual SIM as my wife and I travel overseas often and this way we can just get a pay-and-go SIM and use it without removing our US SIM. I am AT&T and the network and data appears to be great.", "This phone seems to be a great deal for the price. I've had it for a couple of days and the performance seems decent, while battery life seems very good. As others have mentioned, the bezels are tiny, which is cool. The screen even wraps around the front-facing camera. I find the placement of the fingerprint reader to be less than intuitive and it's less sensitive than the one on my Moto Z2 Force. Works well with Android Auto.\n\nMy only (tiny) gripe is that the one I received is Spanish-first. You can set it to English when you first start it up, but a couple of folders (like the one for the Microsoft apps, which I use) are still in Spanish. Not a big deal, just wish they had asked instead of shipping me whatever they grabbed off the shelf.\n\nOverall very happy with this purchase! I don't understand why people pay $1000 for a phone when $150 gets you something this good.", "I had this phone for over a month now and I wanted to let people know about this phone. It has great features for a little price. The best things about this phone is the battery life. It last for the entire day and if you need a charge it's quick charging. The screen isn't the greatest but it's decent. The camera isn't the best but it's adequate. The ring is loud.\n\nOkay... to sum it up. It's not the best phone but it's a great phone for this price. Everything is not the \"best\" but it is decent. If you want to play games it is not the most responsive in real time. Great battery and charging. Works great for Tmobile. Not wireless charging, nor water resistant. Expandable memory and slightly on the heavy side.", "This is a great, cheap phone for anyone who wants a backup / easy option. I\u2019m not a huge fan of Samsung, but this one was easy enough to use.\n\nBattery life outlasts any phone I\u2019ve ever had, so that\u2019s a huge plus. Screen is a little sensitive, meaning that I had trouble tracing my pass code. But that might be a me thing and not a problem with the phone.\n\nOnly major downside is that I can\u2019t seem to be able to use facial recognition. I set it up, but my phone just says it doesn\u2019t recognize my face.", "I've only had the a20 for a week but I absolutely love it. Great Samsung phone for 2019. Of course, it does all the things you need a phone to do (make calls, text, web surf) but the display is great and the bezels are so thin. I also like that since the phone is unlocked that I was easily able to switch out my sim card from my old phone and put it in this one and it worked immediately (btw, I have Tracfone service). Plus, Samsung has so many neat features to their phones like Samsung Themes. Also the price is a definite selling point. Definitely pleased with the purchase.", "Now all I have are memories of the best phone I ever owned. Had it for just over a year, BEST year of my phone ownership life.

It won't send texts, and doesn't receive all calls. Too bad this ended up being a disposable phone.\n\nThis phone has a weird glitch.....when I go to reply to a text, sometimes i have to hold down on the area where the characters should appear until the keyboard shows up. Just a simple tap in the text box doesn't always bring up the keyboard. Other than that, it seems to be fine. I didn't realize it's glass completely on all sides or I would NOT have purchased it. I had had enough of the glass cracking issue with my S8. This was replacement for that phone and I was under the impression it was plastic on the back, which is what I preferred. Also, it's kinda sucky that the shipper does not offer an expedited option to get the phone quicker.", "This is a great phone I'm still using it till this day. If you don't want to over pay for a phone but still want quality this is a great choice", "I am really happy with my purchase. But there is the only thing that is very awful about this phone is getting signals.

This phone is exceptional for what the pricee is. all I did was plug in my SIM card and my SD card turned it on and boom immediately impressed. It does everything I need. The screen is great and bright, a camera works great, the volume on the phone is good, and setting it up to my personal preferences was very easy to do. I am not disappointed at all and believe that this is probably one of the best unlocked cell phones that I bought at a great price. By the way I am using straight talk SIM card with AT&t service on it.", "Bought this phone as a gift for my dad, he loves it. The camera is awesome with it's dual lens, not quite iPhone or Samsung flagship quality but certainly right behind them.

Even after months of usage, it still responds fairly quickly, and I still have a few gigs of space, despite downloading the most apps I've had on a single phone before.\nI ordered the black one, was sent the red one, I ended up liking it, because it sets it aside from every other phone out there. The plastic shell will scratch, understand this now. Without a case, you will see cosmetic wear within the first week of using it. The screen is not impervious, I have very fine scratches, possibly from sand, or something else coarse or sharp in my pocket.

I had to get on my laptop and type everything into an online translator which was a pain. Then after getting to the point were it was booted up and running, I had to figure out where in the settings you change the language and what buttons and menu options to hit to get there, all in Spanish which was another pain.

With it being an international phone its default is in Spanish, kind of unusual.

This bedskirt is soo pretty and soft.. BUT I really wish I had read the wash instructions before buying. If I had, I may have gone with a different one. There is no way in hell I am taking this thing to a dry cleaner every time it needs a wash. I attempted to wash it at my house on the gentle cycle based on a suggestion I saw when reading the reviews.. And I almost broke my machine. The reason why this bedskirt is so plush is because it has a delicate fluffy inner filling which is why they want you to dry clean only. Also because of the filling, when it\u2019s wet it becomes very heavy. I went to pull it out of my machine to see an error message on the screen and it was absolutely soaking wet. I was as you can imagine, I was very upset and afraid that I ruined it. I ended up throwing it into a garbage bag and bringing it to the local laundry matt to re-wash in a bigger and more powerful machine.. And an error message came up on that one too ! \ud83d\ude02 but I was still able to complete my wash. I was standing there cringing as I watched this washing machine fling my beautiful bedskirt around so violently but I just remained hopeful. When I took it out, I was happy to discover that it had been spun almost completely dry. I anxiously felt around to see if the inside was totally balled up and wrecked, but it wasn\u2019t ! The inner filling was A-ok. I then transferred it to the drier and let it dry for about 12 minutes and it was good to go. When I got home and put it back on my bed I was so relieved that I didn\u2019t wreck it. My bedskirt survived and it looks just the same as before. I do feel as though the amount of stress I went through to wash it was kind of not worth it. So I do love the bedskirt, but washing it from here on out is always going to be a project", "I\u2019m not sure what the whole wrinkle free part is about bc I have not yet washed it. It comes with a natural looking slightly crepe like wrinkle. Came nicely packaged and very fast. I was over the moon when I opened it up and I also had no idea it came with matching pillow cases. The skirt is very long -prob more than an actual bed skirt but it doesn\u2019t bother me at all. It\u2019s great for higher beds like some I\u2019ve had that have a taller frame or the temperpedic mattresses that are sort of thicker than normal. Gosh I can\u2019t wait to sleep again bc this is softer than\nSleeping on a cloud like some of the reviews said it\u2019s exactly like that. Very surprised it is so lightweight but I thought it\u2019d be like a sheet-it is not a sheet thin it\u2019s lightly stuffed and it was warmer than I expected in my room with the ac on high. I am so glad I bought it as soon as I did it could sell out", "I have been wanting a simple drop ruffle bedspread/coverlet in linen for ages...while this is decidedly NOT linen, it is a great substitute. I purchased in white, and although it is wrinkled out of the bag, it is lovely. I was looking for a clean vintage farmhouse look and this delivered. It is subtly feminine and romantic without being cutesy or cheesey or childish. No fussy frills and ruffles mess.\n\n\u2022 I fits my bed perfectly, and the drop ruffle (single only, not multiple/frilly) is the perfect length. My mattress is 12\" thick and my bed frame is about 13\" high, so there is a nice pooling of material on the floor.\n\n\u2022 The material is very soft and at first I was concerned the coverlet would be too sheer (I have sheets in varying shades of blue and patterns) but the top is much thicker than the sides, and the dark blue sheet is not noticeable on the sides or top.\n\n\u2022 There are some threads here and there, but overall the construction is good. I feel confident this will last awhile.\n\n\u2022 The only concern I have is keeping the white white. I was looking at a different coverlet when shopping for something like this and that was described as \"delicate material/dry clean only\" which was a pass for me. THIS one is machine washable, cold/gentle cycle which is wonderful.\n\nI definitely would 10/10 buy this again. If white doesn't work over time, I'll try another color.", "It's lightweight, but I'm in the deep south so that's OK. Color is true blush pink. It has the natural chic wrinkle look, but does need to have wrinkles steamed out because it comes tightly packaged..the skirting bellows at the floor; I have a platform bed with a 12\" mattress. It is soft to touch and is great in the warm temps. I love that it is a true bedspread and has the seam where the skirt meets the top as there is no guessing if it's on the bed straight. Overall great product and value for the money..and the shams are perfect as well.", "This bedspread looks great on our adjustable bed. I am using it on an adjustable base which is not good for a dust ruffle. Great alternative to cover up the bedframe when made up. Very lightweight and virtually wrinkle-free. Has a little bit of 'stuffing' in the top which looks good on the bed. Also, at night, when my husband rolls over and steals all of the covers, I have plenty left on this bedspread to use - ha! I would recommend this product.", "It was cheap, and it shows. It is not awful, but it will do for a while. I cut the ruffles off of the shams, as that is no longer in style. There is batting in the top part of the spread and shams, so when I washed it that kind of bunched up a bit, but I was able to smooth it out. Has stitches in the top to help keep the batting in place, see photo. Not going to have it dry cleaned as that would cost more than the spread. But also wanted it clean to put on my bed. I got the king size, and the skirt lays just at the floor, which is nice. Washed it on gentle, and dried on low. Did good in the washer and dryer.", "I am very happy with this lovely bedspread. It matches my new Queen's House sheet sets. It is light weight and soft. I love the ruffle around the whole bottom. This fits our king size bed perfectly. No hanging all over the floor but right a tiny bit above the floor, all the way around. It is nearly impossible to find a bedspread these days and I hit the jackpot with this one.", "I was'nt sure about this because I thought maybe it would come out too wrinkled but I purchased anyway. Well, I was surprised, pleasantly, how it came out. Not too wrinkled & did not need any ironing. Looks shabby chic with a little wrinkling (naturally looks like that) and washed up nice. Washed on delicate, cold water & dryed on low. The bedspread has a little fill in it too. Very cozy & soft!! I bought queen size for a full size bed because I wanted the sides to come all the way down so I would/nt need a bed skirt. Looks beautiful in my guest bedroom!", "So much bang for your buck!

I had a comforter and bed skirt on the bed, but the bottom of the mattress always showed a little. This bedspread with the 30\" drop ruffle is absolutely perfect. It not only covers the entire bed, but it also reaches the floor on all three sides as you can see. The pillow shams fit king-sized pillows, and the result is gorgeous!

I have never returned a pair in the 20 plus years I have been ordering them online. One thing I have noticed, is that while I don't like the blended fabric as much as the 100% cotton denim because they are not nearly as durable, but they don't lose their shape as badly as the cotton does.

Now, that I have ordered multiple I learned that Levi has different methods. There Levi's stretchy material and then there's Levi's real denim. I learned the real denim is much less stretchy and feels a little more stiff I recommend sizing up by one size or two to feel comfortable otherwise they'll fit a little tight.", "Levi 511's and my body go together like Lutefisk and Butter... Or, for the non-Minnesotans reading this, Peanut butter and jelly. They're all I wear anymore. My recommendation? Go into a store that sells Levi's, try on a hand full of cuts (505, 501, 511, 512, etc) and see if you can find one that fits your body well. Then, stock up on them when they go on sale online or in a store. Can recommend Levi's enough, but just make sure you know what style fits your body best before dumping money into a bunch of them.", "The best jeans for me have always been 511's. Some have been 100% cotton and no stretch and others with just a bit of elastane. The ones with elastane are a bit lighter weight than the 100% cotton and they don't compare to the Japanese heritage jeans. They also don't cost nearly as much. Over the past five years I have found that the elastane is just as durable for everyday wear as the 100% cotton. Some of my Levi's are distressed and some are not. Most pairs are slim tapered, but I do have a couple pairs that are boot cut. In general, the slim tapered fit my body the best. The others can start looking like dad jeans in the calves.\n\nI bought my first pair of Blue Mekong Light jeans recently. As expected they came distressed. As soon as I put them on, my wife loved the look of them. The tapered legs fit great over short boots and look fine with sneakers. The distressed look was just what I was hoping for. The material is soft like well worn jeans should feel. I liked them so much that I ordered a second pair a week later. Both pairs look identical in every way and fit the same way. Perhaps both pairs were from the same lot, none the less, I was surprised at how identical they look and fit. The fading is very nicely done and doesn't have the typical striping on the thighs near the front pockets that you ordinarily see. My preference is to have the fading look natural as if I've worn these to the point where they are distressed.\n\nMost days I either wear blue or black 511 jeans. These newest ones are now amongst my favorite as far as fit, comfort and style.", "I am a genuine Levi\u2019s fan, and have been for many years. These are nice jeans. Particularly nice is the combination of different materials, cotton, polyester, and elastin. So why only 3 stars you may ask? This is the second pair of Levi\u2019s that I have purchased that have color issues. Meaning a spot on the pants is white (not green, as the color was supposed to be). It is a quality control issue, and Levi\u2019s now has a problem. Amazon is always good and honors their return and refund. This is definitely not an Amazon problem. It is definitely a Levi\u2019s problem. I\u2019ve purchased another brand I think ZLZ is the name. Obviously made in China, and I\u2019m sorry to say this but they are cheaper priced and better quality. Get your act together Levi\u2019s or your name is not going to mean anything. I was being kind to give 3 stars.", "The size is good but color is just so so \u3002", "I love these jeans. I bought a pair of the same in \"pants\" version, black, that I could wear on tour with a post-black metal, ambient space rock band, as looking the part was important. (I wanted jeans but they didn't have my size @ the store) When I put them on the first time I immediately felt at least 50% cooler. Or maybe more specifically, it brought my coolness to the surface and I was wearing it. I'm a thin dude - 5' 10\" 150ish - size 30X32 - and also a Gen X'er. Sure I wore skinny jeans back in the day - sometimes with holes in them, sometimes all ripped up. As a longtime professional guitar player I've been in a lot of playing situations, beginning with a focus on rock guitar, so naturally I'm no stranger to tight fitting, package exposing jeans and pants. Luckily I didn't dawn any spandex back then - my legs were too embarrassingly skinny for my tastes. I did have a pair of stretchy black jeans though - with a white snake going down the one side of the legs. They were painfully tight but went well with my equally painfully tight black snakeskin boots. Enter the Grunge era and I could finally let the boys swing freely with boxer shorts and baggy cutoff cargo pants (w/Doc Martens for shizzle). I never looked back. That is until the tour came up. And so it was time - time to look modern again. And man I wish I had done it sooner! They look so cool! Even though I wouldn't get them before the tour I ordered the jeans anyway so I could be even cooler when I got back. With my Doc Martens I look metal - with my black adidas I look like a wanna-be millennial hipster (sans beard) and I love it! Not as tight as the snake ones of course - they are tailored nicely with the evolution in design of skinny jeans over the years, perhaps given the advent of hipster culture. Snug but not too snug, they hug the butt and privates nicely. The sensation mixed with how cool I look gives me a sexy feeling the whole time I'm wearing them that says: \"I am ready for action.\"", "A quick bit of a back story: I've lost about 70 lbs. over the past year. Because of that I've had to replace much of my wardrobe. I'm 6'3\" and now weigh around 200 lbs. I've gone from a size 42 waist down to a 36 and dropped at least a whole shirt size. The expense of new clothes is the downside of getting healthy I guess. Now, on to these jeans. I've been a Levi's fan all my life (despite the fact that they're no longer made domestically, but that's another topic). Never in my life would I think that I would buy any jeans with the word \"skinny\" or \"slim\" in their description. These don't fit me that way; they're perfect. There is nothing \"hipster\" about these jeans at all. They just fit great. I was pleasantly surprised that the fit was exactly what I was looking for. I've worn 505's and 501's my whole life but I've found the rise to be too high in both cases. This jean is classified as a \"low\" rise and it exactly what I was looking for. The 505's and 501's were also a bit more baggy than I was looking for. These are slim fitting without being too tight. I'm not a small man by any stretch of the imagination, but I guess you could classify me as slim or lean now. The style was just right too. Again, classified as \"skinny\" which means they're not boot cut or flared, and are slightly slimmer than straight cut. If you are looking for a jean with a low rise and a variety of color and finish options, give these a try. Plus, at the time of this writing, they qualify for Amazon's Guaranteed Return so you can send them back if they don't meet your expectations. I'll be ordering more very soon.", "I bought the same product from the Levi website. I came with shredded knees. I though, the reason I'm buying new jeans is because the knees were blown out.....Plus, they are not true to size. The black stretch 511 slim is now the black Flex 511, which is about one to two sizes smaller in the waist. So, I came to Amazon and found the OG Black Stretch Slim fit Levis 32 x 34 and they were perfect. Also, fed ex sent back my return to Levi saying that the return sku was wrong. So, I decided to just wear them for yard work or whatever. That's when I realized that they were not my size....of course it was too late to send them back.........so I've been trying to stretch the waist line out....Stick with this product on Amazon, even though Jeff Bezos could give every human being on the planet one thousand dollars and still be a billionaire does't matter....but kind a does.", "The pants are a bit too big, a bit thin and not very firm", "I am new to shopping for clothes on line, so here's my story.

They fit perfect for SKINNY JEANS and the stretch material is awesome (VERY TIGHT) and the color is perfect, they don't look like they've been washed in muddy pond water! Just what I've been looking for! And of course, I ordered the last pair in my size or I would have ordered another couple of pairs for sure, this pair will have to do.....Oh well, needless to say, I highly recommend these to someone who is looking for a nice TIGHT pair of Levi's.

Because of the small space (8'8\"x12'4\" - which i mistakenly remembered as being 9x12) I purchased the 9x12 yellow rug and chose to cover the entire floor. It was quite wrinkled, but after a couple days, and vacuuming it and walking on it like the pamphlet suggested, it has just about flattened out completely. The yellow is a nice bright-ish, almost mustard yellow, almost like a Winnie the Pooh yellow. It was a couple inches too wide for me (my fault for not measuring correctly), so I just folded one side under and flattened it with heavy stacks of books and tools and I don't think it's that noticeable anymore, and anyways my house is a home and not a museum so it works for me!\nI will say that the rug did have a kind of odd odor to it, but my husband said it was just a \"new rug smell\". 2 days later and its gone already.\nI thought the rug had a very decent thickness to it. It was thicker than I thought it would be (I saw lots of comments on the thinness of the rug), so I was pleasantly surprised. The vacuum definitely fluffed it up, and it is quite soft on your feet.\nLastly (not leastly, and I'll probably think of other comments after I submit), this is a definite thumbs up from me. For the price, it's great! Color is good, thickness and softness is good, the price is great, fast shipping (for me anyways), easy to clean... on a note of personal experience, if you're covering the majority of your floor, definitely ask someone to help you, and yes, take the time to move all your furniture out of the room so you have space for the rug to settle.", "I ordered the dark gray with ivory patterns. I absolutely love it! I actually ordered two, one 8x10 and one 5x8. They are perfect for an \"under the bed\" area rug or a middle of the room rug. It is as thin as a normal area rug. It isn't fluffy, but it isn't depicted as being so it shouldn't be. In my experience, fluffy rugs ruin over time with each vacuuming anyway. It comes rolled up with heavy plastic over it. There were minimal folds, only being at the end which happens with any rolled rug and flattens over a day. (i like to tuck it the opposite way for a little while and it usually will even itself out.) Also, the 8x10 normally being $407 I go for $135 which was absolutely amazing and the main reason I went for it. All around happy.", "Exactly what I needed for my green living room , yes when I opened it really had a smell but after some time it goes away.

I looked everywhere for just the right one--Macy's, Costco, Lowe's, Rugs.com, but it was just overwhelming.\n\nI was looking for a soft, gray, easy to clean 8x10 area rug that didn't show vacuum cleaner lines or a spot here or there. Of course, I saw numerous ones on Amazon that I liked! However, I chose this one in light gray (which is more medium gray than light gray). It's very soft, and even more perfect with an Amazon rug pad under it.\n\nAfter reading some reviews, I was a tiny big nervous about creases from shipping, but wow, look at my rug! The first pic is the first 10 minutes after rolling it out--hardly any creases after I rolled the inside end of the carpet roll in the opposite direction.

I was looking for a bigger diaper & Cheaper diaper for my now 3 year old son. I compared the Amazon Mama Bear Diapers with Walmart Parents Choice Dry & Gentle Diapers and the Mama Bear is just as soft, their wider, longer, and run a lot bigger yahhhhh! When I decided to purchase a big box of Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers Size 6 they make the Parents Choice Diapers size 6 look like a size 4. Then I can't find a size 7 in Parents Choice because their either bought out or out of stock sometimes. I love that Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers has no chemical smells, free of bleach dyes, perfumes, parabens, phlathates, latex, no tested on animals, zero to waste to landfills, not tested on animals. When I compared Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers with Walmart Parent's Choice Dry and Gentle Diapers the absorption padding is made with different padding material. When I did a test on each brand the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers absorption in the diaper padding absorbs way more slower than the Parent's Choice Dry and Gentle Diapers. The Mama Bear Diapers remains wet to the touch for a long while, on the other hand Parent's Choice Dry & Gentle Diapers absorb way faster and remains dry to the touch even with a very saturated diaper in the testing of the absorption from each diaper brand. The Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers aren't a bad cheaper natural diaper alternative, but I most say that Amazon Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers most redo their diaper padding for absorption material improvement to be better, that's the only down fall I have noticed trying the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers Size 6 on my son is they don't wick away the pee/urine off my baby skin, like I'm use to with other brands that wick away pee off his skin to a dry to the touch. I would say for sure that Mama Bear Gentle Diapers fit my son so well, than any diapers I have tried except for Amazon Earth Eden Diapers fits him really good too. I love the fit of Amazon Mama Bear on my baby, the fit is so amazing!!!! The Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers for some reason reminds me of Pampers Swaddlers, but without the mesh inside the diapers, then the Mama Bear kind of reminds me of Parent's Choice Diapers as well maybe, the price kind of compared. I have used a lot of diaper brands on my son, like I've used Hello Bello, Pampers, Huggies, All Goods, Earth and Eden, Seventh Generation, Parent's Choice, Mama Bear, Fisher Price, Rascals and Friends, and Luvs. I would say that I love the free and clear diapers group: All Good Diapers, Rascals and Friends Diapers, Earth and Eden Diapers, Parent's Choice, and I also like Hello Bello and Mama Bear Diapers, and the none free and clear diapers group: I love Pampers, I kind like Huggies, but just the Huggies Little Smugglers & Huggies Little Movers, and Luvs, but I be hesitant now to buy these brands because of the chemicals, dyes, fragrance, other bad chemicals in conventional diapers, which I didn't know chemicals where in certain diaper brands and also in conventional diapers can cause health issues like diaper rash, allergic reaction, possible urinary track infection from the dyes causing an allergic reaction. What I have noticed in the free and clear group of diapers there's 2 brands that doesn't wick away the urine/pee, and it's Hello Bello Diapers and Mama Bear Diapers. I would now give Amazon Mama Bear Diapers 4 star because they're made for sensitive skin doesn't cause my son Eszema on his butt to flare up, Mama Bear Diapers are free of harsh chemicals, the best fit, and that the run bigger in length and width, plus the price is cheaper than most natural diapers. I use the 20% subscribe & save, plus the Black Friday 20% and the Mama Bear Gentle Touch Diapers are cheaper than the Parent's Choice.

She's off the charts for her age on growth, so finding something that will comfortably fit and work for us is very important. I'm very disappointed at the price increase. I always thought the price for the diapers was fair. They were not quite as great as Huggies Little Movers, Snugglers, or Pampers Swaddlers (the \"premium\" style diapers from brand names), so I felt happy paying the price we were paying for more diapers in better fitting styles, even if the absorbency and leak protection wasn't as great as the other styles I mentioned. With this price increase, I'm not quite so happy anymore. We are now buying more out of necessity than desire lol. A 25% price increase completely unannounced sucks!

I myself don\u2019t need it; it\u2019s always easy to tell, with Pampers, when my man needs a change. The diaper gets squishy. This might not have been a helpful indicator Pampers intended, but it\u2019s likely due to the absorbancy of the product itself. It winds up being a bit ahead of other brands when it comes to tactily feeling when an infant is wet or dirty and how significant the present inside the nappy will be.\n\nMy little nugget has sensitive skin, and Pampers never irritate him.

They don't seem as much \"just like underwear\" as the premium Depends Real Fit, but in all other ways these are better. I can't use Depends Real Fit; they don't work for me. I would pay more for these than the Depend product because aside from the \"just like underwear\" look, these are superior in almost all ways. The Depend non-woven fabric fits a bit tighter, but the tradeoff is that the pad has to be smaller and can't come up the back at all.\n\nLets face it, even with the Depend Real-Fit most people who need these are going to avoid situations where they are standing around in their underwear with strangers. The Tena are good enough for a slight glimpse of waistband that people won't notice, so I would rather have a product that works a whole lot better than one that looks a tiny bit better.\n\nBUT, as another reviewer had mentioned, it is hard to tell front from back, and every once-in-a-while I need to take them off again and turn them around. Like the other reviewer said, many of us have multiple health issues and that can be a battle my arthritis doesn't need first thing in the morning when my hands already resemble lobster claws.

I'm raising my review up from 4 to 5 stars.\n\nThat small issue aside, these work well, fit well and look pretty good for what they are.

Then I use the spinner part of this MASTERTOP spin mop dealio, and that gets a LOT of water out.

So far I'm very happy with the purchase.\n\nSeparate from the hardware, it's still annoying to see HP putting their special sauce on the Windows installation and interfering with basic operations, like password storage (now offered by all major browsers and even capable of syncing across systems).", "I got an elite desk model with an nvme ssd. If you open the case and apply two nvme heatsinks to the top of the cpu heatsink you will get noticeably better performance, the pc gets warm unless you have extremely overkill cooling around it. It thermal throttles pretty easily without extra cooling. I applied many mini heatsinks and put a 140mm fan atop it and it plays fortnight at lowest settings 1080p, any 2d games are gonna be playable. If using it for work it probably needs no modification other than being in a cold room. Mine only had display ports so I needed an adapter for TV", "Bought one for my elderly father to replace an old clunker he's had for 10 years. Absolutely love the size and the price. I was able to slip it right under the monitor shelf on his desk...now you barely know its there compared to his old desktop (which was compact for its day). Setup was easy-breezy and since it has wi-fi I was able to eliminate the Ethernet cable and easily hide the few cables that remain. Starts up in a fraction of the time and does everything that a home computer should do. My father even plays a few games on it, but I don't think they're especially resource taxing. I would recommend this for anyone who needs a home - and perhaps work - desktop and wants to recapture some space.", "Powerful little box for its size. I use this as my primary work machine and it does everything I need it to. After updating everything from OS to firmware it churns along happily. I recommend upgrading the ram with an extra stick to squeeze out a little extra performance if you plan on doing anything remotely graphics intensive or run chrome, cause chrome eats ram like no other. Otherwise the other machines we use as kiosk boxes and they run perfectly for that, main choice was that these were a spectacular price for the specs at the time of purchase and those don't need much to run so a little future proofing goes a long way in the budget.", "The PC works like it should and is very easy to get set up. The only thing I would caution potential buyers is that when the listing says it has two display ports you need to know that Display Port is a specific thing. The last time I got a new PC was in 2009 and Display Port was not a thing. I had to buy a special cable (Display Port to HDMI) to connect to a monitor. Otherwise, I'm pleased with my purchase.", "This little guy is a gem. It works great and is pretty fast. I bought a cheap VESA mount and fixed it to the wall beside my videocounseling station. Everything is neat and organized. Some of the pop-up HP notices are annoying -- so I took one star away. Can't beat the price.", "I read lots of reviews and checked specs on lots of mini computers. I use HP products professionally and have always been pleased with them. I would have guessed that they would be more expensive than other 'off-brand' (for the US) mini computers, but this one had better specs than anything else in its price range.\n\nSoftware came pre-installed (Windows 10 pro). Easy to set up and use. Has a bay for a 2.5\" drive inside the case.", "I really want to give these 5 stars and I really like the form factor, they run fast, and the price with the Ryzen processors can't be beat. The only problem and it is a BIG one is that the continue to lose their network connection and require a reboot to fix them. We have a ticket open with HP and have not had any luck in resolving yet. We have about 100 of the Intel i3 & i5 versions of these machines and do not have this same issue. The money that has been saved on this line has been lost in productivity and time troubleshooting.", "got mine on sale via open box. unit does get \"audible\" for sure under heaver usage or gaming. too bad there aren't intel nuc sized AMD Ryzen machines but, this is as close as you will get it's just slimer and wider. sure did free up a ton of desk space over an matx tower desktop. seems to play indie games on steam alright. i was also able to put my existing 2.5\" SSD in to this machine as well.\n\nunder load fan is noticeable, if you're sensitive to sound then i'd say it's definitely loud. if it was tad thicker with a thicker heat sink maybe it would be quieter?", "These desktop mini's have gotten so compact that you can hide them under a monitor or vertically mount them and have your whole desk top for use. Its amazing that such a small layout can contain a very powerful processor, memory, and video processor without sacrificing much of anything. Pair these with a good monitor that has internal speakers and you'll be set for years to come.", "These computers are little powerhouses. They are not gamer-level computers, but for most workplace applications, they work great. Also, they have a very small footprint, which is handy where desk space is limited. The display outputs are DisplayPort, so your monitor will need this type of port, or you will need an adapter. Overall, I would recommend these for any general work place needs.", "Bought two for the office, and will likely buy more. Extremely compact. SSD is very fast. Price was great. Would have given it 5 stars, but no option for an optical drive (I know...old school).", "I purchased this for personal use. Space is limited so did not want something big. My knowledge of technology is\nas limited as space. I told my daughter what I wanted, she researched on line for me and told me what to buy. I am happy with it.", "Very nice computer, boots and runs fast. Very small and light. Has one open bay for 2.5\u201d drive inside. Has 2 display ports so you might need adapter if your monitor does not have a display port. Also does not have cd/dvd drive so buy an external one if necessary. No modem either.", "It does what it is supposed to do, fast processing, and a small case. It does however have a fan issue where the fan comes on when it isn't hot or even warm. This is a known issue, apparently that HP is working on a fix for. It's very annoying.", "Great mini PC. We use it at our church and it is fast and the size is a great benefit.", "Getting a pc with a relatively strong processor (similar to gen 6 i5) and video card anwith enough power to allow for multiple multimedia tabs at once in such a compact package was a great move. only downsides are no usb type c power charging but the price is right.", "Its exactly what I hoped it would be.

The difference is highly noticeable between the two machines. I did not have any issues with the layout, which some people have discussed, though I am unsure of why.\n\nThinkshutter <-- This is a nice built in feature that I would like for more notebooks to have. You can purchase little covers on Amazon that stick to the screen or bezel and perform the same way.\n\nWhat I did NOT like:\n\nSpeed <-- It was not as quick as I would have liked when compiling code in IntelliJ. Also, 4K video playback was choppy in fullscreen. I know that the CPU is under-volted to save battery life, but this is pretty unacceptable if Lenovo is offering this machine with a 4K screen.\n\nTrackpad/ Trackpoint <-- I have no clue why the trackpad leaves little eraser like particles on the surface after little use. It certainly was not from my skin. Other users on Reddit reported the same issue, while some stated that the surface was smooth glass and had no issues. On the X1C I had, the surface was rather rough.

To make a long story short ... they had to send out a new shade three times before I got one that wasn't damaged. It was very clearly damage directly from the factory and not from how they were packaged. The packaging was always very sturdy.\nI'm still going to give them a five star rating because their customer service was so wonderful. It's not often that you get customer service reps that really go to the next level for you and the two different gals that I spoke to were amazing. Customer service goes a long way in my book !", "Took me about an hour to put it together by myself. About what you\u2019d expect for a piece like this.

I went back to my mane and tail lmbo, screw some head and shoulders!", "I had terrible dry skin at the front of my scalp, similar to psoriasis. I've been trying different medicated shampoos, creams, oils, etc.. nothing worked. I saw an ad for this head and shoulders, and saw that it was sulfate free.

It smells great and it leaves my hair softer and shinier than Loreal's sulfate free brand.\nThe only problem I found was that my dark blueish black hair faded slightly. Not enough to notice by looking at my hair, but a faint amount of dye washed out with the shampoo. That doesn't bother me at all given that I have complete scalp relief that lasts for days.

Totally safe on my color, leaves hair soft and shiny, yet soothing to my scalp.\nI used Original Head & Shoulders from time to time, but this is several steps above without losing the best of the Original. There\u2019s another version - not sure what the difference is, but may try it in future.", "The scent is lovely. The thickness of the shampoo and conditioner is nice and not watered down. Helps with the itchy scalp", "I love this h&S shampoo. Before I started using this my scalp was so dry my back was dry I mean so dry it hurt. I've been using this for a year and ever since the very first time using it my head or back hasn't been itchy or dry or painful, it's just from running down my back in the shower as I rinse it out that it has completely cured my eczema. Must have. I just re upped my order and they sent me 4 sets instead of 1 lol.

They are moved between the two systems allowing machine based access.

They are inexpensive enough that three devices are now attached to the same linux box giving multiple terrabytes of storage. The USB-C connection with adapter gives a quick change between the USB ports of the Rocky Linux USB-A 3.0 ports and the fedora-33 USB-C ports, allowing portable connection to each computer.

The first two were manufactured in Malaysia, and have been trouble-free. The third was manufactured in Thailand, and was very slow compared to the first two and also had a common problem which is that it doesn't respond to the normal \"safely eject\" procedures. It insists that it is \"in use\" and can only be safely removed by fully shutting down the computer it's being used on, which is not what would be hoped for from a portable HDD. In addition, it was MUCH slower than the drives made in Malaysia, writing at speeds less than half the rate of the drives I received that were produced in Malaysia. So, I returned the drive from Thailand and it was replaced, unfortunately, with another drive also produced in Thailand and also VERY SLOW and impossible to safely eject without shutting down the computer or \"uninstalling\" the drive. Technical support has not been very helpful. When simple questions are asked via e-mail, in response to their messages to follow up on my \"case,\" they just keep telling me to call rather than answering the questions. Again, very simple, very direct questions that should not require a phone call and all the bureaucratic waste of time that goes with that. When I DID speak with technical support, they sent me a bunch of tests to run and refused to stay on the line while I ran them. They were impatient and did not seem concerned to actually resolve my issue. I was initially pleased with the fact that they followed up by e-mail, but now that I realize they refuse to answer any tech questions via e-mail, even though technically they reached out to me to see if my issue was resolved, I am definitely not impressed with their \"technical support.\" I have always purchased WD hdds for my portable storage needs, with one exception that I regretted. I have now purchased 7 WD hdds. I'm a loyal customer. But I am finding that they clearly have some q/a issues, and they do not seem eager to address them, which is discouraging as I feel I have given them every opportunity to do so. I am now uncertain as to whether to try yet another exchange or just to hang onto this substandard third drive or return it for a refund. So frustrating. So much wasted time. I do like the look of the drives and the fact that they're so small as compared to the last generation that I purchased. I'm very happy with the two that were manufactured in Malaysia. But WD should not be selling defective drives, and they should do more to take responsibility when they do. For the drive I returned for replacement, had I gone through WD warranty service, I would have had to pay to mail it to them, even though it was defective straight out of the box, and I would have had to wait possibly weeks for a replacement. That is definitely not what I'd hope for from customer service from such a well-respected brand. I'd like to add that I'm using the drive in Win7, so it is not a problem specific to Win10, as another user surmised. It's a problem with the drives themselves. How do I know? Because I'm using three identical drives on the same laptop and the two made in Malaysia eject just fine, but the two made in Thailand do not eject at all. I've also tried both of the problematic drives on a different laptop, and the problems persist, so my laptop is not the problem.\n\nUpdate: With 150 gigabytes of data already on the drive, I started transferring another file onto the new HDD, and it is transferring at a rate below 8 mbps. Unbelievably slow. Something is definitely wrong with these drives.", "I have been fighting to keep my backups on an older 1TB drive. I use Acronis and they have grown over the years. I was keeping backups of two Windows computers and they would no longer fit on the 1TB drive. I have been extremely happy with this drive.", "This SSD is the upgrade for 2 old HDD's from WD ... they lasted for many years and now it is time to move into the new century ... it is fast, quiet and is totally plug and play.", "The product initially did not work for me on USB 3, but worked on USB 2. That rather takes away the charm! At length, I conclude this unit requires a bit more power from the USB bus than other drives in the same product line. Details follow.\n\nWhen I first plugged it in USB3 (to Windows, on my desktop system), I got the usual 'ding' from the OS that something enumerated, but no drive appeared, and 'Disk Management' in MMC did not show a drive listed. I plugged it into a different USB3, and I /did/ get a disk shows, but the drive made a clicking sound. I immediately unplugged it, because clicking usually means it's dying. However, I regained composure, and tried one of the USB2 sockets. USB2 worked! But that rather takes away from the charm of having a USB3 device (and plus this one is huge, so I really need the high speed).\n\nIt's useful to note here that I have been using a 2TB WD Passport Ultra on this same system for 7 years, and have never had a problem with using the USB3 ports with that device. However, my USB3 is a separate card, and the plugs are in the back, and so I have extensions to bring the ports to the front of the computer. This gave me the hunch that perhaps the power draw of this unit was higher than my older drive, and that the I2R losses might be dropping the voltage. This seemed even more plausible because the extensions are of different lengths, and Lo and Behold, the longer of the two was the one where the drive didn't even enumerate, and the shorter is where it enumerated, but clicked.\n\nI ordered a powered USB3 hub, and waited for it to arrive. I can now report that with the powered hub, it seems to be operating as expected. I'm not super thrilled with this arrangement, but it is what it is.\n\nSo, in conclusion, be aware that this particular unit does seem to draw more power than other models in the family, and if it does not work for you out-of-box, maybe you simply need more power, rather than it being actually defective. It is disappointing that I will need to pack another gizmo (the powered hub) to be able to use the unit in my case, but c'est la vie. Heavens knows how it will behave on a laptop running on battery power.", "Great drive but TERRIBLE mis-toleranced/defective cable included. See below for details.\n\nGreat drive.

This left 4.54 TB of available space (Formatting drive takes up 0.46 TB)\n\n2) The included CABLE is 100% Junk. Throw it away. It is designed improperly with bad specs that do not fit into ANY of the USB-C ports I have. It is very loose and falls out. I had read a few reviews that mentioned this fact so just in case along with my order I got this Anker Powerline II USB-C to USB-C cable:\nhttps://amzn.to/3gK8reu\nIt sucks to have to spend an additional $10-20 for a cable to be able to use a product that should included a good one but....Oh well.\nThe included ADAPTER is GREAT perfectly fine with the Anker cable. It locks/clicks in place as it should. But the included WD cable just falls out/is very loose and will not work. I made sure to line up the arrows on the cable. Tried it on my laptop USB-C port and the WD HDD and my Android cell phone all of which have USB-C ports and it did NOT work / lock in pla ce. I will be contacting both Amazon and WD to complain about this. Not acceptable. Terrible Quality control to not test the fit of the cable to a mating device.\n\n3) I ran benchmark tests using Crystal DiskMark 7.00 x64 bit to test the empty drive out. I ran two scenarios. One going direct from laptop USB-C port to USB-C port on WD HDD (no adapter) and one test when using the included USB-C to USB 3.1 type A adapter in between the laptop and the WD HDD. You can see the results in the attached image, Not much difference in using the USB-C port directly or the USB 3.1 port so thats good to know. Your result will vary.\nIm using a Dell XPS 15 hi spec machine on Windows 10 Pro\n\nOf note: The disk LED light is always flashig on the HDD even when its not reading/writing data. I think you can turn that off but my other 3 WD external HDDs dont do that. They only flash the LED light when actually reading/writing.\n\nHope this is helpful.\nKeep the drive. Ditch the cable.\nGood luck", "First, let\u2019s take a moment to appreciate that this is 2 TB of space on something the size of a cigarette case.\n\nThis was easy to install on my Mac, but when I tried to set it up with Time Machine, Time Machine was not able to format it. It kept giving me errors. Nor was I able to erase anything using disk utility. On a whim I went for the usual IT solution, and simply restarted my Mac. That took care of the problem.

I've tried a lot of products to try to tame it. I hate when it sticks to my face most of all. I have used peppermint shampoo and conditioner in the past to combat this affliction. I like this small batch brand and that it's made in USA and that it doesn't have a funky pump because those things always stop working before the bottle is empty. It smells great and feels tingly on my scalp. It leaves my hair manageable and smelling great all day long. If I had one criticism, I would say the product is thicker than it needs to be. And the plastic squeeze bottle could be made more pliable and easier to squeeze. I'll add a little water to the product to thin it out and it should be good. Will get a little more bang for my buck in the process", "Y\u2019all, I have been using this shampoo set for almost a year now, and it\u2019s been nothing but amazing. To preface, I have fine strands but medium hair density, low porosity, wavy 2a/2b, frizz and build-up prone hair. Prior to getting this shampoo, I had been experiencing some hair loss and I noticed my hair density had changed quite drastically. I certainly wasn\u2019t \u201cbald\u201d, but it was the \u201cthinnest\u201d it had ever been, especially at the temples/hair line. It started with a horrible reaction to the hair products I had been using for years prior (ahem, OGX lawsuit\u2026), which snowballed into developing folliculitis, terrible scalp buildup, FIRST EVER flare of seborrheic dermatitis at the nape of my neck/scalp, and just overall awful hair. From that moment onward, I had tried over a dozen different shampoos and conditioners, specifically ones that were both sulphate (not including a clarifying shampoo that I definitely needed to invest in lol) and silicone free. (*I\u2019m not saying that anyone should demonize these ingredients, but for my fine hair type, I just find that silicone-free is better for me*). Anyways, after months of being unhappy with every different product I tried, I came upon these.\n\nShampoo Notable qualities:\n- Peppermint for hair growth stimulation, SD soothing properties, as well as overall pleasant aroma and tingly experience\n\n-Rosemary oil for definite hair growth stimulation\n\n- Tea Tree oil for exceptional SD treatment\n\n- Great combination of surfactants like cocomidopropyl betaine and\u2014 my favorite\u2014 C14-16 olefin sulfonate, as well as many others.\n\n-moisturizing ingredients too, such as argon oil, a few polyquaterniums, and more\n\nI always do scalp oil treatments the night before a wash, and therefore double cleanse my hair. My hair is always so clean and soft after shampooing, never any residue. It\u2019s also not overly stripped, but still perfectly cleansed and voluminous. Literally my IDEAL shampoo in every way. It\u2019s also extremely concentrated, I\u2019ve had the same bottle for several months and it\u2019s not even to the halfway mark yet. AND I always shampoo twice.\n\nConditioner:\n\nNow, this is where this set let\u2019s me down a bit. Do not get me wrong, this is a very nice, creamy, medium-richness conditioner. Not too runny to the point that I\u2019m using half the bottle just to feel like I\u2019m getting somewhere (although it is still thinner than how I usually prefer my conditioners to be\u2014 but that\u2019s preference). But this is NOT a bad conditioner!!!! The problem is, there are over 5 different proteins in the entire ingredients list, and barely one or two conditioning ingredients. And for my frizz-prone, low porosity and therefore very protein sensitive hair, that\u2019s a l o t. Someone who\u2019d benefit more from it is a person with color-treated, or very damaged hair.\n\nNonetheless, let it be clear that I\u2019d still pay for BOTH if it meant I could repurchase the shampoo again. That\u2019s how much I adore it.\n\nAs for my scalp issues and hair loss, I never want to give a singular product credit for something that is governed by many different factors. A mixture of devoting time and effort to scalp and overall health\u2014 (no more scalding hot showers, not putting my hair in super tight hairstyles anymore, UV protection as well as no more heat tools, not letting my hair get too oily/built up, scalp oil treatments + massaging before washing, using less irritating products on the skin, clarifying frequently enough, etc)\u2014 AND using this shampoo is what I believe truly helped me recover. I have zero desire to ever use anything else again :)", "The bottles are much smaller than I thought. But that\u2019s my fault for not reading the size. However, it smells amazing and really helps wake you up in the am. My hair feels soft and very clean.", "I have used for a couple of weeks, but can't say it helped to grow hair or slow loss. However, it really cleans your hair and smells great. Your scalp will tingle a little, but it's not painful. Your hair and scalp will feel great and clean.", "I don\u2019t write reviews but I will for this product because I have seen a noticeable change in how much hair I lose when I shower thanks to this shampoo and conditioner. I have already re-bought it once. Yes the pumps may not be perfect but it\u2019s not that big of a deal. Normally when I would shower I would lose a decent amount of hair at each time but since using these, it has gradually grown less and less to the point where sometimes I don\u2019t see any hairs in the shower drain. I think it will be sticking with this product for a while.", "Shampoo smells decent, but the conditioner smelled almost \u201crancid\u201d. It was a sealed bottle, so I don\u2019t believe it was spoiled, just didn\u2019t smell great. Hair feels very soft. The product is very think and the squirt pump on the bottle is very small, so it takes a bit of effort to get enough out. Should\u2019ve made pump bigger.", "I am stunned at the transformation of my hair. I have bleached curly hair so already a recipe for dryness. This combo not only feels delightful while using but has transformed my hair with moisture. I was a hard nosed tresseme user, but after reading about health issues stemming from using certain shampoos, I scurried to find something chemical free. Boy did I hit the jackpot!", "I like the shampoo and conditioner but both pumps on the bottles are defective. I couldn\u2019t get either one of them to work.", "So when I opened the package I was disappointed in the size. I should have ready the oz instead of liked at the advertised photos. Misleading for sure.\n\nAs for the quality of the item. The shampoo leaves that mint tingle on your scalp and the smell is so refreshing. Now, the condition feels amazing and silky and makes my hair feel so healthy, but the smell is horrid. Not sure if I received a bad batch or that\u2019s just how it smells. Will try another bottle before I conclude on a negative review.\n\nAll in all I love the way my hair feels and the experience in the shower. I feel refreshed and not weighed down like most cheap shampoos leave me feeling.", "Timely and new", "Update: I have noticed a significant increase in breakage in my hair after 2 weeks of use, hair shedding seems to be increasing. Unfortunately will be returning.\n\nSo I don\u2019t hate this set.\n\nWhat I loved: the shampoo smells amazing. I also have a very sensitive scalp and after several washes, my scalp seems to approve, though does get a bit dry by the end of the day on wash day. Which is somewhat normal for me if I don\u2019t work a small amount of conditioner on my scalp to act like lotion. The next morning after a wash day my hair is pretty soft. So far it also doesn\u2019t seem to effect my box dyed red (from dark brown) hair. Started using this the second wash after dying my hair and the color is still bright.\n\nThings I\u2019m meh about: I was a little let down by the tingle mentioned in other reviews. Nothing major, was just hoping for more. I haven\u2019t had it long enough to really be able to tell, but I haven\u2019t noticed a difference in dropped hairs. I shed like a husky, I also don\u2019t brush my hair daily due to texture (wavy with some curl) and wear it up loosely for work. So far seems to be about the same size hairball at the end of my showers. Where my hair isn\u2019t dull, it doesn\u2019t seem to have as much shine.\n\nThings I\u2019m not a fan of: the conditioner STINKS! Not sure if I got a bad bottle or what but after my shower tonight, the conditioner went in the trash. At first it reminded me of raw shea butter with a faint hint of peppermint. Wasn\u2019t what I was expecting, but I thought I could live with the natural smell. The next time I used it, it seemed more pungent. Tonight I didn\u2019t notice the smells until it was already on my hair, but it was so bad I had to rinse it out immediately. Now that\u2019s all I can smell on my hair still. I notice while my hair is soft, it\u2019s not as full. It doesn\u2019t seem to effect my waves and curls though. By the end of the first day and into wash day, my hair does feel a bit dry. My hair tie gets tangled almost every time I take it out. I also can\u2019t wear my hair down the second day. It doesn\u2019t want to lay right where this wasn\u2019t a problem with my last wash set. Combing it out after a shower is also more work than it\u2019s been in the past. Which surprised me because it feels very smooth when rinsing.\n\nSo over all the shampoo is pretty great. I really like it and would buy that again if I could buy just that. The conditioner, I\u2019d consider trying it again in the case that I got a bad bottle but definitely wouldn\u2019t buy it again.", "Love this shampoo, it's really doing wonders on my hair. I'm seeing a lot less breakage and hair fall since I started using it. :-)", "I suffer from female alopecia and it is a constant nightmare trying to find hair products that can help bring life to my thin locks but this stuff has done amazing things. I switch shampoo and conditioner pretty often because something may work temporarily but my hair always ends up going back flat after some use and starts looking all thin again. I have been using this shampoo and conditioner for 3 months now. I wash my hair about three times a week and I leave these in for about 5 to 10 minutes each before rinsing. It smells amazing and it makes my scalp tingle which actually feels pretty good. I don't know if it's bringing blood to my scalp or what but my hair hasn't looked this good since the alopecia started. Fingers crossed that this continues!!", "Best shampoo I have found in years.", "Works well and great smell", "Definitely a staple in my hair routine, love these two together", "Got this for itchy dry scalp and so far so good! My scalp is no longer irritated and my hair feels so soft and smells amazing!", "I had been using the ion sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner from Sally's beauty supply and it was making my hair feel so damaged and dry and stiff I couldn't take it anymore. I ordered this stuff and when I tell you this stuff is amazing, I mean it! I can tell the difference in the shampoo and conditioner before I even got out of the shower. As I was applying and rinsing out of my hair I had already tell the difference. The peppermint gives it a nice cool tingly feeling that is like invigorating your scalp but not super crazy it feels so good. It's soft my hair doesn't feel weighed down or oily my hair looks and feels so much better even after just the first wash I was immediately able to tell the difference I will continue using it. For years I have been looking for a shampoo and conditioner that I could actually just stick with instead of having to keep trying others whenever my bottles ran out but I think I will order this again for sure when these bottles are gone. I highly recommend. As far as my hair type, I have highly processed hair that I color very often. My hair gets oily after just one day of not washing it so I use dry shampoo the day after I wash it. My hair is kind of brittle on some parts and dry. This shampoo and conditioner made my hair feel so much more moisturized than the ion sulfate free deep or intense moisture whatever it's called. Either way it didn't do the job it made my hair feel terrible and the stuff instantly showed the difference!

The biggest cons for me are the price and some inconsistent performance at the top of the neck/lower jaw. However if you're in a hurry and don't have much issue with the price tag, then this is a solid 4 out of 5 stars from me.\n\nLong Review:\nTo ensure you know which razor I'm reviewing since Braun seems to have a dozen versions of each of these bad boys, I'm specifically talking about the Braun Series 9 9385cc razor. This is the newest (as of this review 10/21/2020) revision of the Braun Series 9 and reflects the upgraded battery life, internal processor, external display, traveling case, and cleaning station. Some of these upgrades are more cosmetic, while others are more significant (e.g. battery life), but Braun refers to all of them as upgrades so we'll go with that. The model I have is the Graphite colored one.\n\nSo for starters, this is my first foil razor since the 90s. Prior that I had my all-time favorite electric razor which was a rotary Remington from the 80s which sadly got plunked into various sources of water by wee ones too many times (yes, unfortunately including the toilet - thankfully unused at the time). After the Remington got to the point I could no longer repair it I switched over to a couple of different foils (not Brauns) in the 90s and did not like them, at all. So I switched over to Norelco rotaries and used those up until the SensoTouch 3D came out in 2011 or so. I loved the SensoTouch 3D (or whatever they eventually renamed it to) - that is until Norelco decided to outsource its replacement razor head manufacturing to Lucifer and ended up turning one of my favorite razors into the biggest piece of garbage I have ever had the displeasure of slicing my face to pieces with. If you're also a veteran of the SensoTouch 3D replacement heads you'll know what I mean, if you're not, just go check out the reviews here on Amazon for the replacement heads.\n\nAnyways, the reason I share the past 3+ decades of my facial lumberjacking history is mostly to state that I have no experience with Braun and haven't used a foil since the 90s. So if you're someone who hasn't used the Series 3, 5, 7, 8, or 9 before or hasn't used a foil electric razor before, we were roughly in the same spot. Since my once-beloved SensoTouch 3D was causing literal bleeding probably 1/3 of the time I used it, I swore off Norelco and their cheap replacement heads forever and decided to give foils another try. I was really considering the Panasonic Arc 5 as it was much cheaper than the Braun Series 9, but then I noticed a consistent pattern of Panasonic just giving abysmal customer service responses here on Amazon and elsewhere, so I decided not to take that risk. Maybe Braun would be no better, but I was a seeing a clear pattern of garbage customer support from Panasonic with my own eyes. So then the decision came down to Braun Series 7 or the Braun Series 9.\n\nThis is probably the biggest weakness in my ability to review the 9385cc - I haven't used any variation of the Series 7, old or new. A lot of what you've probably read is the pros and cons of the Series 7 vs. the Series 9 - at least I know I read a bunch. In my case I ultimately decided to spring for the Series 9 because at a certain point you just get real tired of running a cheese grater across your face each morning (looking at you Norelco). That said, because I did not get the Series 7 I cannot compare the Series 7 and Series 9 with my own follicles. My guess is that the biggest and best argument for not getting the Series 9 is because the Series 7 is either \"better,\" \"just as good,\" or \"close enough\" when considering the price difference. So I guess that's the downside to my review, having not used a foil in so long and having no prior experience with Braun I cannot make good or fair comparisons to other razors in those categories. However, what I can do is share the experience of someone who is \"new\" to foil razors (at least those made in this millennium), Braun, and who is upgrading from what had become an objectively bad razor.\n\nSo all that said, my thoughts on the 9385cc? I think it's a great razor. It shaves most of my face exceptionally well. Definitely better than any rotary I've used in the past 20+ years has done, maybe even better than my beloved Remington but that's hard to say due to nostalgia. I say most because it does struggle a bit at the top of my neck, you probably know the spot, where your neck meets your lower jaw. I've found that I have to shave that spot over and over, up and down, left and right, and it still doesn't get all of it sometimes. That said, it does not give me razor burn even when I really work at it, and now that I've used the razor over a month I've only had a *single* hair get pulled to the level of causing ouchies and desires to smash the razor in the early AM hours. This was a nearly daily occurrence with my old rotary. So it's a very smooth and gentle razor for me and if that means it struggles with one spot of my face, that's a trade-off I'm willing to make. The razor does get a bit hot, but this hasn't seemed to affect irritation levels for me, though if you take a longer amount of time to shave I could see it becoming an issue but for me at least it's not caused any discomfort, just a noticeable level of heat. It's also far louder than my old rotary, but if I remember correctly foils are just more loud in general, so I can't fault it much there. The attached trimmer is decent, to be honest I've never found the built-in trimmers to be exceptional, but this one isn't noticeably bad, so really no complaints there either. The razor is easy to take apart and clean as well, which I guess is a good time to mention the cleaning station.\n\nI have never owned a Cadillac-esque cleaning and charging station for an electric razor before. It seemed a bit.. excessive? I mean cleaning the razor and adding a drop of oil here and there has never been an issue. But here I am, a little older, with a little more gravitational pull, and a fair bit lazier than I once was. So I figured \"Why the heck not?\" and opted for the model with the newest cleaning station. Here's the thing. My thoughts remain the same overall. The station is absolutely, categorically, emphatically not required. Is it useful? Sure. Is it worth the extra money? For me I have no regrets. But MUST you have it? Definitely not (for example you can easily charge the razor with just the cord). You can still just clean and oil your razor the same way people have been doing since electric razors were invented and you'll be just fine. Also, you don't have to follow Braun's (in my opinion excessive) directions and use it each day. That would not only drain their blue magic razor juice and your wallet quite quickly, it just simply isn't needed. I use mine once per week, mostly in place of when I would have normally oiled the razor. So I view the extra cleaning and disinfecting as a little bonus, but the other 6 days (I normally shave 7 days per week) I'm still just cleaning the razor the old fashion way, with water and/or the little brush. You'll read this hint elsewhere, but with the cleaning/lubricating fluid (the blue stuff) don't throw away the cap for the bottle, if you want to use the fluid less often you can easily replace the cap and it will keep the fluid from evaporating. If you leave the fluid open and don't use it it will evaporate and you'll still have to get more, and then you won't even have the benefit of an overly clean razor.\n\nFor battery life and travel I can't say much yet. Since I use the cleaning station once a week I also charge the razor once a week at the same time and the razor performs flawlessly between those charges. If you're following Braun's advice and using the station once a day then you'll probably forget it even has a battery that needs charging. As for traveling, I've heard some people say the Series 9 doesn't travel well. I've not traveled with mine yet so I can't say for sure. The 9385cc comes with the nicer leather travel case, but there's still no sort of included cover for the foil-head itself, which I could see being an issue. While I generally take pretty good care of my items as I travel, even with my attention to safe packing a flight attendant still managed to accidentally crack the protective cover on my Norelco once when smooshing in another bag to the overhead bins on a packed flight, so the best laid plans of mice and men and all that. In the case of the Norelco the protective cover did its job, whereas the Braun doesn't have one, so that does concern me somewhat, but the leather case itself does seem more sturdy than the case my Norelco has. Since I'm not traveling much right now it might be a bit before I can test it out, and there may well be a significant difference in protection quality between the higher and lower end travel cases spread throughout the Braun line, but I'm not sure.\n\nWrapping up, the 9385cc is definitely a very solid 4 out of 5 stars for me. It's overall the most close and comfortable shave I've had in a of couple decades and it has some nice added features. It does struggle a bit around my upper neck/lower jaw area, but not so much as to dock more than a single star. However the big issue here is price. Simply put, I do not know if the Series 9 is worth the price over the Series 7. Everything I've gained from my old Norelco I may have also gotten with the Series 7 and saved money, so again that's the caveat of my whole review. However, as I am not a razor collector with lots of spare change, I'm personally very happy with my decision to go with the Series 9, regardless of how effective of a razor it is in comparison to the Series 7, simply because in my own circumstances it is a massive upgrade and feels like a quality razor.", "Let me start off by saying historically I have not been a fan of electric shavers. Unfortunately, I was placed on a medication that increases bleeding risk the physician strongly advised using an electric shaver. For 50+ years I have used double blade razors and have been very satisfied with the results, despite occasional skin nicks. I did try an electric razor about 40 years ago, but did not like the closeness of the shave. There certainly is no shortage of options from which to choose. I intended to purchase a rotary head shaver, but I read several reviews that implied the shave is less than comfortable. In the end, I chose this Braun shaver with a foil head. Despite some reports that said the shaver was loud, I don't find the volume to be a problem. It certainly is louder than my double blade razor! The shave is very comfortable without any pulling and irritation. I am using Williams Lectric Shave as a skin prep. Overall, the closeness of the shave is very good. Is it as close as my double blade razor - No. I didn't expect it to be that good. Is this fact a deal breaker - No. Overall, I very pleased with this shaver. And guess what -- No nicks! The cleaning device does a good job cleaning and lubricating the shaver, but talk about something being loud. At least it is not close to your ear. I don't have any contemporary electric shavers for comparison, but I highly recommend this Braun shaver.", "This is fantastic shaver.\n\nIt has a few quirks to get it as close as possible and pick up all the stray hairs, but it's easily the best on the market.\n\nIrritation -\nThis is as safe for sensitive skin as it gets. The fluid they use in the cleaner IS irritating but cleaning by hand is as simple as applying some soap and running it under water. You don't have to clean it every day. Every few days if you detach and tap the hair out of the blade you'll be fine for weeks. You can play around with pressure, direction, and a few other things but after you get your pattern down irritation wont happen regularly. I was on accutane as a kid and my neck is very sensitive because of it, this shaver is by far the best option.\n\nCloseness-\nAs close as it gets. This shave is comparable to a razor when done correctly. There are a few tricks like going over your neck at a few angles, or turning the shaver upside down for the trick spot under your nose, but once you're done experimenting it's basically as close as a blade, just barely not there. Easily the closest shave I've had from anything electric.\n\nSpeed-\nHands down fastest way to shave. The design makes getting clean lines for side burns incredibly easy and cleaning (assuming you don't use the station) take all of 30 seconds, ever. The powerful motor means even the thickest beards have less repetitions and again the bar design is just incredibly easy to make clean lines with. Pick and shave and be done in a minute, or 2 if you clean it by hand.\n\nThe cleaning station is pretty bad. It's nice to charge it standing up but the cleaner clogs with hair regularly (still works, just gross), and the newest model seems to leave the shaver wet 24 hours after cleaning. I stopped using it on the last model because the fluid gives me irritation but tried it to see if they fixed the issues. Instead, they made them worse.\n\nThis is still by far the best shaver on the market, even with it's quirks of having to shave at multiple angles or flipping it upside down for some areas.\n\nEveryone it putting disclaimers in there reviews, here's mine. I paid full price for this thing. I write reviews because I miss the days when you could buy confidently just looking at an items rating. Those days will never be back, but I can at least give people an honest well thought out opinion should they happen to find my review.", "What this shaver is:\n\n1.  It is the most recent, top tier wet/dry foil shaver made by Braun.\n2.  It is an effective, ergonomic, well designed electric foil shaver, equivalent or better in comfort and performance to Braun's previous two iterations of the Series 9 lineup in their electric shaver models - which are excellent.\n3.  It is identical in size, shape and weight to previous Series 9 models, and shaver heads are interchangeable.\n4.  It has a slightly different display, and slightly different exterior cosmetics, than previous Series 9 models.\n5.  It has a slightly longer battery life (60 minutes vs 50 minutes) and a slightly faster internal processor (32-bit vs 8-bit) than previous Series 9 models.  Other technical specifications are identical.\n6.  It has a slightly different cleaning station than previous Series 9 models, with a different part number.  Although the stations look identical on the outside (and use the same Clean & Renew cartridges), older Series 9 shavers will not initiate a cleaning cycle in the new station, but will charge, and the cleaning status display is also slightly different.\n7.  It is also expensive, but actually in line with other top tier shavers from other manufacturers\n\nWhat this shaver is not:\n\n1.  It is not a Series 7, or a Series 8, or any other series in Braun's lineup.\n2.  It is not any other shaver brand - Panasonic, Philips, Remington, or anything other than Braun.\n3.  It is not a rotary shaver (see #2).\n4.  It is not a DE razor, or a cartridge razor, or any other bladed razor.\n5.  It does not have a replaceable battery.  Neither does any other modern rechargeable shaver.\n6.  It will not work as a corded shaver.  Neither will any other modern wet/dry shaver.\n7.  It was designed for shaving your face.  Not any other hirsute body parts on a human, although it might incidentally work for that.\n\nIf you were expecting any of the above on the \"not\" list, in spite of Braun's marketing for what this shaver actually is, you may be disappointed. But if you are in the market for a new Series 9 (or just for a great foil shaver), you should give this one a hard look.  If you are the owner of an older Series 9 and you like it, this one adds features described above - slightly longer battery life, different cosmetics - and perhaps marginally better performance (subjective), but whether enough to replace your current Series 9 shaver is very much a personal choice.  The new 93XX Series, for me, does seem to provide a slightly smoother and more comfortable shave than the previous generations (perhaps attributable to the faster processer and perhaps more rapid automatic beard density detector), but again purely subjective experience. Along with other Series 9 generations, it provides arguably the most comfortable shave you can get with an electric shaver, foil or rotary. The 20% increase in battery life is a plus, and the new display includes shaver head status, cleaning status, lock and battery charge indicator (and is a white - or light blue - LED instead of dark blue), but otherwise is almost identical to the 92XX models \u2013 which again are excellent.  Highly recommended.", "This razor is incredible!! I have never been able to use an electric razor due to the razor burn and lack of ability to effectively shave my beard. But this razor is fantastic at shaving my beard almost as close as a manual razor and shave cream and no razor burn! The battery life is incredible. Pricey but worth the cost!", "I have been using this razor for more than 2 months.\nI have used many brands of electric razor over my 65 years. I started with Norelco rotaries, then Remington foil shavers, then back to rotary. But more than a few years ago I switched to Braun. First the Series 5 then the series 7 which I used for about 10 years, replacing the head many times. I told you that to tell you this, despite the cost (which is extensive) I am very happy with the series 9. Compared to my 7, it is quieter by a significant margin, and it cuts better and doesn't irritate my skin. Cleaning is a snap using the Braun cleaning system (you can't use the older one as the razor fits differently in this one, but it uses the same cartridges as the older system for my 7). I travel for work, so portability is important and I easily get multiple weeks of daily shaves from the battery without hardly moving the battery indicator. It packs a bit longer than the series 7. From a shave perspective, for my beard I, will say that it takes some work to get a very close shave with a 1 day beard, but a 2 day beard is a snap. I think the slightly longer hair is lifted better by the new head design.\nI don't like the ergonomics as much as I did the series 7 (the new series 7 is drastically different of course, so these comments are only germane to those transitioning from the older 7 design). The 9 is longer and the head floating seems different. I sometimes find myself flipping the razor over to get some parts of the upper neck under my jaw. I really haven't settled into the best combination for my face yet, which seems strange after 2 months... The trimmer is horrible. It is like the old series 5 and slides up from along the back of the razor. Unlike the old series 5, the cutting edge of the trimmer has a little rake which really only allows you to cut well in 1 plane. What this means is that it is easy to cut sideburns (which I like) but effectively useless to trim eyebrows (which I need to do occasionally). And when it slides up, the end doesn't really clear the end of the razor head, so it is difficult to see where you're cutting because in the mirror the razor body blocks the view without some contortion on your part.\nSo... despite the lack of ergonomics, the end result is a very good shave, especially with a 2 day beard.\nOh, and by the way I ALWAYS use Mennen afta pre-shave. My father used it and I've used it for decades. I hope Mennen never stops making it. Although this razor is supposed to be usable in the shower, I haven't tried it.\nUPDATE 11/20 This razor is still going strong. I've adapted to the ergonomics and also noted that the cutter grids on the head have a directionality to them which seems to work better on my beard in one versus the other direction. Still not using in the shower, but note that it drags too much if used on wet but not lubricated skin. So lubricate.", "I\u2019ve been using electric razors for 40 years. I have a thick beard and typically get five o\u2019clock shadow sometime around noon. I also have sensitive skin, which made using a straight edge razor problematic. Over the years I\u2019ve switched between foil and rotary razors, getting my start on a Norelco because that\u2019s what my Dad used. More recently, by far the best razor I\u2019d used was the Braun 7. Study construction, compact and wicked sharp, it was almost ideal. Almost. Unfortunately the Braun 7 was not a wet/dry razor and I prefer a wet shave so, after some time, I switched it for a Panasonic Arc4 which, at the time, was allegedly the best wet shave out there. I\u2019m not a fan of the Arc4. Oh sure it\u2019s waterproof and powerful, in fact it sounded like a jet engine it was so loud. Shaving with foam or gel wasn\u2019t a problem for the Arc4 at all, the problem was that the shaving head was large and unwieldy, and the shave itself was harsh. In fact, after a few shaves I started seeing razor burn similar to the straight edge. The Panasonic did give a close shave, but it was loud, unwieldy and tough on the face. I then purchased the Braun 9 which, at the time, was waterproof but you couldn\u2019t use foam or gel. It was a superb wet shaver, but I was missing the foam or gel, so I purchased the Norelco 9000 (In late 2019). The Norelco has a lot going for it; it\u2019s quiet, maneuverable, gentle on the face, and you can shave with any sort of foam or gel you like (I prefer Speck or Proraso). Unfortunately, the Norelco doesn\u2019t give a very close shave, so last week I purchased a Braun 9385. In my assessment it\u2019s hands down superior to the Norelco. Using Speck as a cream, the 9385 provided a noticeably closer shave than the Norelco in about a third of the time. The battery capacity is noticeably different as well; the Braun was nearly fully charged after the shave while the Norelco was typically down close to 80% after one shave. I think the sideburn trimmer on the 7 was a better design than that on the 9 (and the earlier 9\u2019s), but I made the right choice going back to this Braun 9 which is foam/gel compatible, and you should give it a good look as well.\n\nJuly 21st update:\nI just wanted to add that after one month of daily use I\u2019ve only recharged the razor once and, frankly, the battery level was still well above half but I wanted to test the cleaning station. Still getting a close shave. Highly recommended.", "No surprise that it\u2019s not as close even a mass market blades razor. I\u2019d switched to simple Gillette 2/3 blade cartridge shavers with foam 20 yrs ago when my old 1990\u2019s Braun gave up the ghost. Now two decades later to get the shaves done quicker with less water splashing on the counter and allowing for travel usage in an easier form I decided to get a new electric shaver. 20+ years of advancement gets me a 3 section blade head and a cleaning base. But the limitations of electric are still there.\n\nWhat it can\u2019t do is get as close as blade of course. But it also cannot seem to get and shave those soft flat lying hairs on my neck and just below and under my ears at the back of my cheeks. So there, especially if I go 2-3 days between shaves , I\u2019ll still have to quickly go over these areas with the blades razor afterward. But much less mess, less water , no shaving creme needed.\n\nAs I house mine in the cleaning and charging station I don\u2019t know the number of days it will work off of a charge , I\u2019ll assume the description and manual are accurate there. The battery is replaceable with some effort so at least when the rechargeable no longer holds a charge in 7-8 years I can replace that part.\n\nWhen buying keep in minds the consumables. The head assembly with its blades is about fifty each and needs to be replaced every year or so depending on how often you shave. The cleaning station fluid needs to be replaced every month or so , as it does clean and also evaporated slowly even if you don\u2019t shave often. But it\u2019s available in a six pack for much less than the blade.\nSo figure $65/yr in cleaning fluid and replacement blades over the years.\n\nThat said the cleaning system works. I just replaced the fluid tank that cam with the shaver and it had a nice coat of stubble on the bottom of the tank. It definitely cleans the blades and gives them a very light citrus scent though I only smell that if I\u2019ve waited to shave when my face is fully dry. The cleaning cycles run after you put the shaver back in the dock and press the button. It\u2019s cycle to clean is longer than you might expect which explains why it\u2019s so thorough. Clean lubricate and dries the shaver.", "I've had a Series 9 for over 10 years, using it twice a say. It finally wore out, but I like it so much I bought another.", "I've been using a Series 7 790cc for years and years. I wore out the first one after several years -- this was four and half years ago. I came here to shop for a replacement ... and was pushed away from the Series 9 both by the mixed reviews and the Series 9's higher price tag.\n\nAs you can see for yourself, some people love the Series 9, but a number of people thought it was not as good as the Series 7 for one reason or another, or not as good as \"Fill In The Blank Other Brand\" -- and enough of those complaints (and the 7's lower price) were enough to talk me into sticking with what I knew, and so I bought another identical Series 7.\n\nNow, that second Series 7 is holding up just fine. Even though it's been a while since I bought it, and although it's starting to show its age, honestly, I probably could have kept going with that second Series 7 for a while longer. It's a solid workhorse, and it has treated me well. But I felt like self-indulging, just because, and upon reading the reviews here once again (which, like before, are mixed, but this time are more solidly leaning in favor of the Series 9), I impulsively took the plunge and spent the extra money for a Series 9 9385cc. And I'm so glad I did.\n\nMaybe I will feel less euphoric if I give it time to break in? Maybe then I'll understand better what the negative reviews are trying to tell me? But I don't think so. Right now, as a new owner of a Series 9, I *love* this thing. It shaves closer and cleaner than the Series 7, it both shaves and cleans much quieter than the Series 7, and my skin feels noticeably more comfortable afterward. (Not that it was ever really irritated after shaving with the Series 7, but the Series 9 just is noticeably gentler on my skin even so.) Besides all that, it just *looks* nicer, at least to me. All in all, I definitely feel like I've traded up. The Series 9 is definitely an improvement over the Series 7, at least to me, and I am delighted with my little splurge.", "It's been a great razor for me, but the power button fell out of mine like many others. I can go on with a good review about the razors capabilities, however, when a 'nickel' quality power button breaks and falls out it's all a fail.\nI've owned Braun razors for 20+ years with no issues. I thought I would upgrade my 14(?) plus year razor for a new one.\nIf you buy one, be sure to get the extended warranty if you want an extra year or two with the razor. Otherwise, it's a very expensive chance you are taking.\n\nAddendum: My mistake in the earlier review is that I forgot the Braun razor had a two year warranty. I submitted a request for warranty coverage and Braun picked up the shipment thru UPS. After a wait time of a month, and no response from Braun's repair affiliate in the U.S., I received a brand new razor from Braun. I was surprised by the new razor, especially when a power button replacement seemed like a cheap repair.\nI changed my one star rating back up to four stars. My opinion is that Braun really stepped up to satisfy an unsatisfied customer.", "Going with the Pro/Con format:\n\nPros:\n* Battery life is great.\n* Cleaning station looks better and has a dryer to dry shaver after cleaning (Old 5 series didn't).\n* Nice travel case included\n* Waterproof\nCons:\n* Still will yank hair out occasionally like my old 5 series, esp a long straggler\n* The old scam of needing a level 3 cleaning when you don't, which uses more cleaning solution ($$), is still present. I'd say even more so now than my old one!\n\nEx.\nFull battery and cleaned after last use.\nI shaved moustache stubble, less than a minute of shaving. Put back on charger and 3 drops appear, indication of level 3 cleaning needed! (Pic)\nThis same task used to trigger ZERO cleaning needed (maybe lvl 1 if I took along time) on the old 5 series.\nNo way to override once it decides. Yes, you don't have to hit the clean button every time but it will be there till you do. Irritating!", "I absolutely love this shaver!\n\nI bought it to replace the first generation of Braun\u2019s self cleaning shaver that I purchased several years ago. It\u2019s still worked, but the cleaner was going through the cleaning cartridges faster than before and after reading about the new shaver and features, I decided it was time to upgrade.\n\nLet me say that the prior shaver was outstanding, over the years I\u2019ve started shaving my head as well and I light the top of the line skull shaver and it couldn\u2019t hold up to the old Braun shaver that I had. Fortunately I was able to return the skull shaver and get a refund.\n\nAfter I received this shaver and did the first shave, I don\u2019t know how they did it, but Braun made it even better. The motor is noticeably more powerful and much quieter.\n\nIt does a better shaving job than the old shaver, using the same blades.\n\nThat is probably due to the increased power and number of cycles the motor does (40k/min). Braun describes it as \u201cSyncroSonic\u2122 technology with 40,000 cross-cutting actions per minute.\nMultiplied by Sonic technology. Braun\u2019s patented SyncroSonic\u2122 technology reads and adapts to your beard. Checking its density 160 times per minute. Providing extra power exactly where needed most.\u201d\n\nUh... yeah, ok.\n\nWhat it really means is that it powers through your beard effortlessly leaving you with a closest shave.\n\nFor me it is as close as a blade.\n\nI can\u2019t say enough good things about the shaver. The new shaver cleaner is outstanding as well and the cleaning fluid lasts much longer.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to try the best. Amazon has a generous return policy, so you really have nothing to lose.", "The Braun shaver was purchased for my husband. He says he gets a close shave...like he used a razor instead of a shaver. The best for a baby face! And it has a self cleaning head!", "I do not write many reviews saving my words for products that truly blow me away\u2026 this is the best shave I have ever had without any irritation and I have sensitive skin. I have tried less expensive products including Norelco, and all left me with razor burn no matter how carefully I used it. This shaver is phenomenal and has provided dry shaving without any irritation period. Worth every penny and saves on buying gems/creams and blade replacement. Get the charger cleaning station as it does a superb job of cleaning the razor head. I highly recommend this product without reservation.", "3 stars is an odd rating to give, but the title sums it up. I first got the Braun 3040s which is their entry level shaver. After using it a few weeks, I decided what the heck and got the premium model hoping it would give a closer shave....\n\nIt doesn't. I do experiments where I shave a little with one, then the other. Sometimes the 9 picks up hairs that the 3 missed, and sometimes the 3 picks up hairs that the 9 missed. The 9 glides a little bit smoother, but it is not noticeably any closer of a shave to me, and both are nice on the skin and not harsh. Also, the springs on the 9 have less \"give\" to them. The springs on the 3 allow the foil to compress and conform easier when you put pressure on your face. Funny enough, the \"cheaper\" less rigid feel of the 3's springs is actually preferable to me. Also the 3 is lighter and easier to maneuver when I want to shave at odd angles. I could care less about the swivel head of the 9; I really could care less. So much of this stuff is honestly gimmicks and unecessary.\n\nSo I'm giving this 3 stars because I prefer the entry level series 3 when all is said and done. A product costing 5 times as much should be exceptionally better than the entry level. It's not, and the fact that I still have to do numerous passes at odd angles on my neck even with the premium model makes me not have too much respect for it. Everything on it works fine and it gets the job done, but the entry level model which costs basically one fifth of the price does the job just as well. That's all folks!", "I finally made the leap...I have been a tried and true Norelco shaver for more than a decade. I decided to do some research and found some great articles pointing to the Panasonic and Braun razors as being far superior...\n\nI decided to go with the Braun based upon it being a bit more compact and having been rated as almost as close a shave as the Panasonic but with more comfort.\n\nI waited patiently while this model was released in Europe in the Fall but was not available here until 2020. Man o man am I glad I waited. I absolutely LOVE this razor so far.\n\nSome observations:\n-I have yet to nick or irritate my skin. No matter how hard or taught I press or pull while shaving, it just glides and does its thing without any marks or nicks.\n-Does not pull or yank if I go a couple days and let my beard get a lil longer.\n-Does well wet or dry...it really is up to your preference.\n-Love the cleaning station. I just had to change out the fluid for the first time...I got probably 5-6 weeks of use out of it before I had to swap the cartridge the first time.\n-The travel case works great. I have taken the razor on several business trips and never had to worry about it getting beat up.\n\nAgain, I cannot say it enough: this is the best electric razor I have ever owned. And I have been using purely electric shavers for my entire adult life (30+ years).", "Easy to clean, but a bit awkward to use.\n\nThe bulkiness of the shaver makes it awkward to position around my face, and the backside additional detail trimmer just gets in the way. The additional detail shaver is not very good at what it's supposed to be used for, but it's better than nothing...\n\nOther than that - fantastic shaver and easy to clean with a long battery life.", "you may have to do a pass with the back cutter then shave to get it all off...but it works great. doesn't irritate my skin regardless if its a 2 min shave or a 20 min shave. Gets my jaw line, my neck, upper lip, under lip and all other areas great. Wish the clippers on the back had a bit longer of a reach...hard to see around the huge shaver head what you are cutting away at your ears. Scaping other areas of the body is a breeze, not so sharp you feel scared of a snip, but quick at getting everything off and away. I put off shaving to weekly or longer before this purchase, now I shave every 2-3 days and its a breeze. I'm not at all buying into their scheme of cleaning and oiling weekly.... those water capsule refills would add up in cost and once they open it starts to evaporate. sounds like a corporate scheme that I am not buying into. I wash it after each shave by hand, I plug it into the cleaner every 2-3 months. 1 liquid capsule has lasted 5 months and seems still full, unsure how to tell if the cleaning chems are still active or there still however.", "This is my first experience with Braun, though have been using rotary (Norelco) electric razors for decades.\nMy typical shaving process is to use the rotary for the initial shave, but then a cursory dry shave with a razor, so as to clear any missed areas. Usually a 4-5 minute shaving session is now, with the Braun Series 9, just about a minute's time. Not only smoother overall, but seemingly very gentle on my face.\nGerman engineering and construction are perhaps the main selling point on this item for me, and I am very willing to pay the premium for (what I am now convinced is) the best.\nThere are some reviewers who claim other razors do the same for 1/2 the money, but I remain doubtful. This is an exceptional shaving/cleaning system and I would encourage anyone to try it."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XQXZXJC", "title": "Xbox One S 1TB All-Digital Edition Console (Disc-Free Gaming) - [DISCONTINUED]", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61p7mgi0GAL._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "12,616 ratings", "description": "Xbox One S All Digital Edition V2 Console Bundle - For Xbox One - Downloads for Minecraft, SOT, & Fornite Battle Royale - 1TB Hard Drive Capacity - Enjoy disc-free gaming - Includes 1 Month trial", "reviews": ["This thing is in perfect condition", "When you get the Xbox all you have to do is what it says on your screen or, if you have an Microsoft account then just press \u201csign in\u201d and put in your Microsoft email and password.

Welcome to level two, where you need to find your long discarded TV remote and click through input sources like a Neanderthal with a wooden club.\n\nThe Xbox logo appears, throbs, throbs, throbs again. Is it loading something? Should I wait? Will there be any instructions? The answer to all three, obvious only to Microsoft designers, is... no. Before sacrificing a small woodland creature to appease the Xbox gods, I consulted Google. The multitude of post n this very topic, told me I should press the Xbox button on the controller... which I did... repeatedly. Other than my blood pressure going up, nothing happened.\n\nAlrighty then... back to Google... turns out the controller takes AA batteries. You have to pay extra for the rechargeable one, because the Xboxes are actually shipped from 1982 to the present through a one way wormhole, and rechargeable batteries didn\u2019t exist back then.\n\nEasy right? Pop it open slip the batteries in, move on. I dare you to get the batteries right on the first try. By the fifth attempt, my hands trembling with murderous intent and my eyes blinded by throbbing rage, I figured out the batteries are parallel even though the springs are on opposite sides, and the side that looks like the positive is actually marked negative in a plastic stamp on the lid I\u2019m holding in the other clenched fist.\n\nI\u2019m 30 minutes in at this point. I realize this dates off to a bad start, splash some cold water on my face in the bathroom, and head back in.\n\nI press the Xbox button... a gray screen appears... I squint to realize there is slightly darker gray text. I read it 3 words at a time between eye massages and gulps of water as every neuron in my brain strains to decipher the near impossible to read update notice.\n\nThen I notice the progress bar... a dark green line camouflaged against a slightly darker green line... moving imperceptibly slow.\n\nAt this point I know the fold out lied to me, but it\u2019s too late, I\u2019m invested. I press on, angry, miserable, and wishing for a swift death.\n\nThe update screen clears a few minutes after my tears dry on my face. I\u2019m faced with a captcha.\n\nYep... a captcha... on a gaming console. One of those wobbly text ones where the letters blend together so it could be a \u201col\u201d or just a \u201cd\u201d ruining your life. I fail twice... my wife joins... we fail two more times... now the whole family is being mocked by Microsoft. My daughter starts crying... vein in my temple feels like it\u2019s ruptured. The captcha lets us pass only after extracting our life force.\n\nWith thoughts of packing it back up, I\u2019m faced with the username and password screen. Where just to be funny, Microsoft provided an in screen keyboard where only some of the characters are valid and there is no submit button. I start mashing the controller randomly simply to keep my hands from hurtling it through the tv. I\u2019ve never rage quit a signup before, I press on.\n\nI\u2019m given an option to choose my color... this makes me very angry. After completely bombing the entire experience up to this point, Microsoft decided they would redeem themselves by letting me choose an accent color? If in that moment I knew who made that decision, I\u2019d be in jail for homicide right now.\n\nFinally... I\u2019m in... surely it was all worth it... the setup was a horrible journey through all of Dante\u2019s levels of hell because all of Microsoft\u2019s effort went into the console design.\n\nImagine leaving hell... only to land in a funhouse of mirrors, clowns, and spinning rooms. Better is debatable.\n\nI ended up playing Sea Of Thieves with my friends three times.

I anticipated liking this newer and larger unit even more. Mistake. The screen is larger, but movies are not noticeably clearer than they were on the older unit. The sound is noticeably worse--unlike the old system, it makes music sound tinny. As a reader, the HD 10 tablet is so-so. On the older model, it was very easy to access a table of contents, for example. On this tablet, one can sometimes find it and sometimes not. The HD 10 is painfully slow accessing books that are already downloaded. It's painfully slow in allowing access to the home screen. Sometimes Alexa is available to help. Sometimes she's on coffee break. The older tablet lived comfortably in an Otterbox with a build in screen saver. Such an accessory doesn't exist for this model. The recommended cover is heavy, and it doesn't completely cover the tablet. The available screen saver has the tendency of developing bubbles, and it shows finger marks badly. The best thing about the HD 10 is its seamless access to the Kindle Store and Amazon Prime. The model works but is a step-backwards from its predecessors. As Dr. Jekyll beseached his chemist, \"Send me some of the old!\"", "I ordered the one with special offers because it was cheaper and I didn't realize what the special offers were until it arrived and I tried to use it. Between the special offers and the popups I wasn't getting much use of it. I put some effort into it and got it straightened out and I am happy with it now. I understand the company would have done that for me for $15.00 after I had already put more of my time into getting it to work to suit me. I would have given it five stars if it had worked in the beginning like it does now.", "Just not a great as my old fire 8, could be totally a personal thing but I can say I used and carried my 8 a lot more than this HD 10 is getting used the touch screen is not the same as the 8 and I seem to repeat swipes more it's kind of a touchy touch screen. I got a case for the 10 and when you close the cover it muffles the sound quite a bit and I have to adjust the volume always much. On the other side of picky.

For both the surface works well, switching between modes is flawless and the pen is very responsive. I got the matte black one, and while i like the color it does chip easily, with light usage there is some chips in the paint but that is to be a expected with matte colors, they just don't hold up as well. I would not recommend getting matte black for a child or if you are a heavy user. Another thing is that the batter doesn\u2019t last long when using the surface continuously even when on battery saver, I'm a student so there are times where i could be using it for hours at a time, pretty much after 4 hours I\u2019ll have to plug it in. Which leads me to the charger itself, the connector is magnet based and not a real port so to speak, so its very weak. If you\u2019re like me and you like to use laptops on the couch or in bed its going to constantly come unplugged from shifting and movement. Its very annoying i wish it was just a normal charging port. The battery and charging port are the main reasons i rate this 4/5 stars, the decision to get matte black was on me so ill take that L, but over all i do like this laptop/tablet. I don\u2019t use this for gaming so I don\u2019t know how it holds up there, but i cant imagine having steam, discord, and whatever other apps open and having it run just as well as a dedicated desktop, this is more of a light work laptop. As i said before i do use this for drawing and for that it does hold up well. I typically have a few chrome tabs open and a large canvas while drawing (5600x6000px 600dpi) and even when i get up to 40 layers i don't experience lag. And unless you\u2019ve got eagle eyes, you wont notice any delay from the pen, unless you\u2019ve got some high stabilization settings. If you\u2019re looking to upgrade your laptop or looking to consolidate your tech, this is a great product. This totally killed my need for my ipad and runs way better than my old 2017 laptop, so much so that i ended up selling both of them.\n\nSome notes:\n- the pen is sold separately but i do recommend getting it if you plan on drawing or using the surface to write notes.\n- if you plan on getting a keyboard with it I recommend the brydge surface wireless keyboard, the hinges are strong and really make the surface feel like a laptop", "The portability and comfort of the tablet with the functionality of a full-fledged laptop. I bought a Surface 3 several years ago and now... I can't go back. I love these things too much. It comes with me everywhere. If you're wondering why buy a Surface which is twice the price of a laptop, here's why:\n1. If you read a lot of pdfs or e-books there is no comparison.\nUsing the pen on pdfs, the ability to jot down notes in word or pictorial form, the ability to create links to other information that can later be clicked on: Unmatched anywhere else\nTurn it sideways and it's a full sheet of paper for writing and notetaking\nTurn it sideways to read Comic Books! OMG!\nI'll be honest, I'm a gamer and this is my gaming buddy. I pull up ESO maps and One Note allows me to mark up the maps I find online to check off what I've accomplished, rearranged, plan, it's incredible\n2. Versatility\nI watch a lot of movies and tv on my advice. It's comfortable, easy to hold, just the right size screen, phenomenal graphics and good sound\nAs previously stated, I read on my device\nI am a student. I Word Process. A LOT\nI am an Excel nut. I spreadsheet like a crazy person. I attach a mouse and organize my life.\nI spend a ton of time using video conferencing on this thing\n3. Physical Perfection (OK so it is not as light as your tablet but for what it can do, totally worth the extra weight which isn't that much)\nJust the right size screen which is totally touch and pen friendly\nGood battery life and easy and fast to charge. Not so happy about the way the charger connects with the longer part of the charger pointing down which makes it super easy to accidentally dislodge the magnet (CON 1)\n\nIn my opinion, this is the perfect electronic for my lifestyle\n\nSo, what's wrong with it?\nOnly one USB port and no place to insert extra storage or portable storage without using your only USB port\nNo MICRO SD Card slot\nThe Charger connection is A. Not universal and B. Stupidly located. You'd think Microsoft would have figured out by now that if you use a laptop ON your lap it'll get disconnected due to poor location\nBUY THE KEYBOARD! If you want a tablet, buy a tablet, If you want a computer you need a keyboard why doesn't it just come with one?\n\nBottom line is this. If you need something versatile and not specialized, this is your computer. It's worth the money. If you're looking for something to run a specialized program or a gaming computer, this is probably not your computer. It's not the most powerful device on the market but it is by FAR the most versatile. I could not recommend a better device for students. Buy a protective case, throw it in your backpack, purse, tote, car, suitcase, whatever let it become a part of you, you won't regret it. It is my travel buddy carrying my movies, books and work with me wherever I need to go.", "Love it for my projects and it's very mobile", "Well where do i start..... i ended up getting my item and everything was good for about 20mins of use... however after 20mins my screen would freeze for 10-30 secs. I blew it off at first but then it happen 10mins after then it became a often issue. So i ended up going for an exchange. (The worst idea I\u2019ve ever had). I called up amazon and told them my issue and they were quick to get me a replacement so as first i was satisfied until the surface pro 7 came in the next day. I open the box to find out the box it comes in is not only damage but in a renewed box didn\u2019t even come in the same box it should have come in, then i open that to see the surface pro and the screen film wrapped around it was really dirty as if they dropped it in dirt or so and fingerprints all over the machine. So at this point I\u2019m just hoping it works. This one was not charged at all at 15% like it usually is if you were to buy from Microsoft or an apple device would normally be. So i put it on the charger to find out that it not only has screen tear straight down the middle of the screen but a big red dot half the size of the screen was on there as if they drop the surface pro. So at this point i immediately call amazon and i talked to a representative that ended up giving me a hard time about another replacement even though this one was obviously there fault. So i ended up talking to a supervisor that ended up giving me a hard time as well and in the she said to me that they only do a exchange once but as a one time exception they\u2019ll do the exchange to which i responded with i only want to do the exchange if it\u2019s a brand new product that they are giving me not a renewed one and undamaged. To which she agreed that she would make sure it would be done and put in her notes so the wear house knows. Well the next day came and guess what.... the man that drops it off throws my package at the wall of my house from a big distance he didn\u2019t see me at all so when i raced over the man jumped in his car and quickly drove away knowing what he did. Not only this but when i open the box the surface pro again was in a dirty renewed box, at this point I\u2019m just hoping it still even worked again no power so i plug it in and guess what it works surprisingly after all that. However i Notice something was different with the boot up process so i knew something was wrong i go to the setting of the computer and the version i bought was 8gb of ram i5 model with 128gb of memory the one i receive as a replacement this time was a 4gb version i5 model with 128gb of memory and GUESS WHAT A DIFFERENT GRAPHICS CARD AS WELL. The surface pro 7 i got not only had 4gb of ram which was wrong but a different graphics card as well that comes in a surface pro 5 are you serious.... so i called up customer service again asking for a supervisor yet again..... just wanting a refund the man told me well i see here that you have a couple of exchange for this device already so i told him this story i am telling now and ask him i wonder why i have \u201ca couple of exchanges\u201d to which he said well instead of a refund i can get you a brand new one and told me how he had to make a couple of phone calls to do this for me so i told him this is the last exchange I\u2019ll be getting ill be asking for a refund next like i previously wanted..if the next one comes in the renewed box which that would mean it\u2019s used.. if it\u2019s broken or the wrong model I\u2019m done with trying and I\u2019m done with the surface pro 7. not only was this the worst experience with amazon that I\u2019ve ever had and worst costumer Service but now I\u2019m going to hate the surface pro 7 because of this. I\u2019ll see what i receive next as of 02/23/2020\nSorry for the long review but i felt my experience should be shared for others to see.", "Always worth the price to me. This is the 2nd one that I have owned.", "Great for travelers who need a functional computer that can also serve as a tablet. I got th Surface Pro 7 because I travel for work and will also be starting grad school so I may need to study on the plane or after work in the hotels. I wanted the full functionality of a computer that would allow me to use MS Office programs as well as the functionality of a touch screen, tablet and inking feature to take notes for class. I am just getting accustomed to the inking feature but I can see that it will be a great asset to me during my program and I enjoy the overall portability of the Microsoft Surface Pro 7. The screen size is just right for me as I don\u2019t like large computers. I have also purchased a wireless keyboard and mouse for when at home to make it even easier to use when typing papers or working on projects. I also purchased a cute flowered skin with white. sage, pink and gray to protect the metal from any nicks or scratches. I also purchased the silver pen and got a sage green skin to protect it. I like that the pen magnetically attaches to the side of the Surface Pro 7 and that the pen can erase using the eraser on the pen. The only reason I gave it four rather than five stars is that I am finding that not all apps are offered in the Surface Pro that I currently have. The selection seems quite limited and you can\u2019t get apps from iTunes or Google Play as neither service is compatible with Windows. I am most disappointed that Scribd is not offered as I was hoping to be able to read books while in flight. I have read that there is VM Ware apps that may work. I am not very technical so I don\u2019t know much about it. I appreciate any suggestions from Microsoft or techies on how I can upload Scribd on my Surface Pro 7. Thank you!", "Better than I expected!", "Many reviews said they didnt get what they paid for, in my case that did not apply. I got a like new, Surface Pro 7 with the promised processor, memory and drive.\n\nFor what I paid, the upgrade from my Pro 4 is amazing. I decided to get a dock and let this take over not only my laptop needs but desktop also.\n\nThe only 'con' I have is the battery life seems to be fairly short. Sitting on the table in sleep mode took 33% of the battery after 12 hours. I wouldn't think that would deplete the battery just sitting there. May have to find out if that can be replaced. But the usb-c port allows me to plug in to my dock and not only have the ability to connect my sound system, mouse, scanner, keyboard, etc. with just one little plug....AND IT CHARGES!", "I wanted a tablet that could double as a laptop so I could write and practice drawing on. I also needed something for on the go when I'm programming. The screen resolution is large enough to fit multiple windows on it for the size. Battery life is meh, but I usually have it plugged in anyway.", "I use this daily for school and have had no issues yet", "4 Stars for great experience within first year.\n\nFor the first year this device has been great. I wish I had this in college. With the touch screen and battery life, for $750 - $800 this is a great, lightweight laptop for the average student.\n\nNow after a year some problems I've run into:\n- Cannot use while charging > leads to a bluescreen or forced shutdown\n- There's a weird glare inside the screen only visible on dark backgrounds\n- SSD has started to slow down as time goes on\n- When charging must go through full Shut Down process", "I really like this Surface Pro 7. It is exactly as advertised with one exception. The battery life is nowhere near what is advertised. On battery saving mode, using only Onenote for taking class notes, it lasts about 4 hours. Fortunately it charges up very quickly though. I can't see any way that I would get a full days use out of a full battery charge in any circumstance. In my case that is not very important because I am always around an outlet but if you need a tablet that will last all day away from a power source you will have a problem. The camera is good enough, not as good as the Apple camera, but I don't really use it as a camera anyway. I use mostly the 365 programs and find that it integrates these programs seamlessly. Onenote comes with the tablet and has been an amazing app for my vet school classes. It saves my many hours of study time. My only issues are with the instability of Onenote. It closes itself down every few minutes and is very frustrating. I'm sure there is a fix for this but I'm also sure that I won't get it from Microsorft as they have a technical support team that is on par with the customer service team at the cable company. I've contacted them 3 times now and my issue is never addressed. I was actually told to contact Amazon since they sold it to me. It seems like after spending a thousand dollars on Microsoft products they would at least provide a bit of tech support. I'll just have to scour the web for a fix to this I guess. Overall I would recommend this tablet to every student. It seems to be a fantastic and fast machine.", "I was worried after reading reviews and seeing that a lot of people had received the wrong product. Could be they selected the buy used and save button. None the less I purchased the surface pro 7 with core i7 and 16gbs of ram and 256 gb SSD. A week later I received a brand new still in the unopened Microsoft packaging surface pro 7. It runs absolutely great on performance mode and charges fast really fast. The battery doesn't last long under heavy load maybe 5 to 6 hours. And that's fine for looking at blueprints and 3d modeling products for me.", "Great machine but the battery live could be improved. I would use a desktop for gaming.", "This is my first purchase of a laptop and any surface product. I did my research on the device before purchasing because I'm doing remote learning and an art major so I already knew what I wanted in a laptop and the pro 7 delivered! I bought this laptop as new so I don't know the case for the rest of these reviews but mine came in the box sealed with plastic NEW WITH EVERYTHING WORKING. Screen works perfect as a laptop/tablet and connects well with my hotspot. The only downside is that I paid so much hoping for the sim card or esim option to be there but it wasn't and although the battery still needs improvement I find that if you allow the laptop to rest every hour the battery drains less. I work so I don't have to use it every second but something to keep in mind.\n\nUpdate: Turns out this laptop has a tendancy to freeze a lot, so if your wifi is top tier you should have no worries. When I use public wifi (which I hate doing), im able to load pages etc. When i use my hotspot (not on my phone) it takes 5 minutes just to load a simple search. This wasn't the case when i first got it, and I even increased the gigs on my hotspot just for it to run. Also, portable chargers dont work unless you get the same magnetic charging chord with usb at the end and a portable with 10000mah. Now I give it 4 stars.", "My previous laptop was a godzilla, 15 inch monitor, weighs like 3 pounds or something (2014 model). I was looking for something that had the horsepower for what I needed, but also the lightness to carry it around. Although battery life isnt, the best, I DON'T MIND!\n\nThis thing is a beast! Im very happy running programs like tableau, zoom, excel, powerpoint, all at the same time and with various files and this thing doesn't even flinch. The first few hours setting up and downloading all the programs it felt a big sluggish and I was starting to get worried. Once that was done, it started to fly.\n\nYes, the rotating screen isnt as flawless as apple's iPad. That said, I bought this not to look pretty, i bought it to be my tool in battle. Being able to run all the programs that a regular PC can run is the main decision I went for Microsoft Surface. The only downside is that Microsoft is a bit costly on the accessories front.\n\nI recommend this piece of tech to anyone who needs to travel or is on the move. I'm a relatively big guy and i've had no major problem with the size of the keyboard. I do put it FLAT on tables because my keystrokes tend to be pretty hard and the keyboard is the most (in my opinion) fragile of the accessories.\n\nLastly, the Pen interface is not perfect YET but oh man, as a first timer working with it, it kicks total ass and makes note taking in OneNote a complete positive trip.", "I get worried with Microsoft since my last surface died on me after 4 years. Well in this instance I liked the warranty and purchased from this company regardless of some of the reviews. I turned it on to set it up and the tablet just died. It\u2019s charging now. There were a few small dirty marks on the inside of the packaging. It was sealed and in the original box. I purchased this from here brand new along with the insurance. Box had some dings on it that I took pictures of. Hoping that the battery just needed to be charged and no other issues. Product looks good.", "I love this thing! I'm primarily using it as a writing tablet and e-reader for part-time grad school, and I'd like to start using it for work (engineer). It's improved my workflow a ton. The Surface Pen is great and the magnet makes for a very secure attachment. I considered the Surface Pro X, because it has an option for stowing the slim pen in its keyboard but opted for the regular surface pen after trying them out in a retail store.\n\nI've deducted one star because:\n\nThe large bezel. Doesn't bother me much at all, but it really doesn't stack up to competitor designs in 2019/2020. Still looks very sleek overall.\n\nWindows 10 works surprisingly well in tablet mode, but Microsoft is really missing an opportunity by not having a good built-in or Office e-reader (epub, pdf, mobi support) with pen support for document/ebook markup. Edge doesn't cut it feature-wise. Luckily there's a popular app in the Microsoft Store called Drawboard PDF that works really well. The lack of Microsoft application support for critical Surface features is another reason for deducting a star! OneNote and other apps were great on here.

Just google 'ARM processor limitations' or something similar and you'll find a list of what apps and software this device DOESN'T support. Microsoft's product page says this: \"App availability and compatibility may vary. At this time, Surface Pro X will not install 64-bit applications that have not been ported to ARM64, some games and CAD software, and some third-party drivers or anti-virus software.\" So - a beautiful device that I thought would be perfect for my son, and it was a big fat disappointment.

Should've seen the red flag, but was too distracted by the quality of the device itself. Make no mistake it's a very nice device. It looks and feels expensive. The screen is beautiful, the touch screen is very receptive, and the battery life is very good. That's all the positives I have to say about it.\n\nUnfortunately, the proprietary ARM chip they put into this specific tablet utterly destroys any functionality this device might've had. Nothing is compatible with it. It can run word and that's about it. I was gifted the adobe creative suite for a year and was only able to use adobe acrobat and photoshop because NOTHING else was compatible with this device. Even those apps stuttered to the point of being almost unusable. Couldn't work Indesign for my publishing class and couldn't afford a better device despite paying nearly $1,600 (keyboard and pen included) for this useless thing. The surface pen exclusive to this device is utterly useless when the only drawing app it can only run paint, there's not a single decent drawing app compatible with this device. It also has trouble connecting to my printer despite nearly every single other device I own has not a single problem with it. That's not even mentioning that microsoft just got rid of their online customer support, which I have contacted multiple times with a variety of issues this thing had. Including one of their tech support admitting it was a faulty device.\n\nIf you're looking for a tablet to use for school, save yourself the head ache and buy yourself an ipad pro. I wish I had.", "I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought this device (the 8gb/128gb model), but I'm actually very impressed with it. You do have to understand the limitations of the device before buying it though.\n\nTo start, ARM apps run incredibly fast. It's crazy how fast they are. Using the ARM Edgium browser (you can find the exe of this online, it's not published by MS just yet) is easily as fast or faster than my 8th gen Intel laptop. Even content heavy websites load very quickly and scrolling smoothly is no problem. Every ARM app I've tried runs great. The problem comes when using x86 apps. Some apps, like MS Office, Chrome and VS Code, run great, but some apps like Spotify and 1Password run like absolute trash. They bog down the entire system and even just clicking on something can take 2-3 seconds. Adobe also claims that they will optimze all their Creative Cloud apps for ARM \"soon\". WSL (linux on windows) works just fine as well.\n\nBuild quality is also fantastic. It feels very solid and well put together. The user replaceable SSD is a nice touch as well.\n\nBattery life is very good as well. Video playback from ARM apps like Netflix barely use any power at all. With normal use, you can easily get 9 hours out of it.\n\nThe LTE connection is also strong and works great. I'm using it with T-Mobile and I get about the same speeds as my Note 10. I leave the LTE connected all the time (even while connected to wifi) with very little battery sacrifice (the advantages or ARM/Qualcomm chips is really shown here). If you use a Digits SIM (T-Mobile only), you can actually get texts and make calls from this device too.\n\nThere are some strange bugs, like the display being very dim after waking up from sleep (you can fix this by manually increasing the brightness), and night light not working on external displays, but hopefully Microsoft will fix them soon with firmware updates.\n\nOverall, if you already have a main laptop and just want a secondary device, this is a good choice. I do wish it was cheaper, since with a keyboard it's going to be at least $1100, and maybe released a few months later. It's a little strange that their own Edge (chromium) browser and Office don't officially support ARM yet.", "Not sure what all of the negative reviews are all about.

The new Microsoft built (aka non-Intel non-AMD) CPU won\u2019t run most programs: Adobe, Dropbox, etc\u2026\n\nPrior to buying I did my research and found the only complaints with the Pro X were with the processor/CPU. I don\u2019t need the latest and fastest tech so processers do not typically figure into my purchase decisions. Ultimately, I figured an X or a 7 would suit my needs. When I laid hands on the X I loved it and was woo\u2019d by the almost edge to edge display and the keyboard with the hidden and rechargeable pen compartment. I bought it. INSTANTLY THE PROBLEMS BEGAN. I really only wanted it to review and edit large volumes of PDFs for work, which I keep stored on Dropbox. Step one install Adobe FAIL, step two install Dropbox, FAIL. The products could not run on that device. Could not figure out what was going on but then traced it back to the CPU. Microsoft invented their own CPU for the X and it\u2019s not compatible with anything. Everyone knows the Intel and AMD rule the CPU world and I figured Microsoft competing might not be all that bad. But their \u201ccompetition\u201d doesn\u2019t even get out of the gate as it won\u2019t run anything, thus making the Surface Pro X absolute crap. Final straw was trying to create a shortcut on the desktop, you can\u2019t do that on the X.

I bought it for the LTE features after owning a Surface Pro 7 thinking. they would otherwise function the same. Adobe Acrobat DC was glitchy from the beginning. I was having too many issues so decided to factory reset the computer. Then Acrobat would not even try to install. I called Adobe and was told that many of their products will not operate on a Surface Pro X and they had no intention of making them work in the future. Turns out there are a lot of software products that will not run on this computer. I think it is reasonable to expect that anything an earlier version (Surface Pro 7) can do could be done on a later version.\n\nAfter talking to Microsoft Customer Service I'm getting the hand. I explained that it's basically useless to me and just wanted a credit.

I wanted to get a Windows based system I could carry around, had a usb port and ran all Microsoft Office/SQL Server products. Plus I wanted to run some heavy graphics video games. I got everything I wanted with this.\n\nThis did not disappoint! I was first amazed at how easy the keyboard was to type on and how the tablet/keyboard nicely magnetically snapped into place and easily unsnapped. I've used MS Windows since day one and I was a little worried about how it would translate from a tablet to a \"laptop\". Microsoft got everything right with this. I could easily use the keyboard mouse, a usb mouse and touch the tablet and all moved the mouse. They work pretty nice once you get used to them working together since the USB mouse tends to move around when you balance it on your lap.\n\nFast. It is amazingly fast. I got this with a small hd and then bought a 512 gb sd card (one they recommended). There's a nice little slot behind the back flap that the sd card simply slides into. I could possibly get another sd card if needed and swap them as neeed.\n\nI installed some heavy duty games on the sd card and tested out some of the most intensive graphics games. While the tablet got a little warm, it performed like a charm without a glitch. Everything that I installed on the sd card worked without issues so I saved over $500 on a larger hd since the sd card was only $70. I really, really like how Microsoft got the tilt-back flap stand so that it is ideal at almost any angle and stays where you put it. My only (small) gripe would be that if I stand it up straight, it is easy to flip the tablet forward onto the keyboard. Fortunately a simple flip backwards and using the sweet face sensor takes me back to where I was within a second or two. Still, it would have been ideal if they could have somehow prevented it from flipping so easily. A very small gripe.\n\nMicrosoft also did a nice job on implementing some automatic clean-up routines to keep things running smooth like any other tablet. I of course loaded it with software as soon as I got it.\n\nFor me, this is more than just a Windows tablet. I can now setup SQL Server databases and design front-ends in vb.net, excel or MSAccess. Setting up an inventory or other tablet based system will be a breeze and I have over 25 years of SQL Server, vb and MSAccess code.\n\nYes. Microsoft did well on the Surface Pro 7. Like the ipad was when I initially got it, it has now become an extension of me. I don't miss the ipad or android tablet since I also have an xbox and tons of Microsoft games. Gamers will love this gem on the road. All the Steam games I tested (Age of Empires, Civilization, C&C, Stronghold, etc.. worked like a charm (these games run heavy with the graphics) You can feel the back warm up but it never gets hot. The i5 doesn't have the fan where the i7 does. I got the i5. I didn't want a fan inside.\n\nThe charger nicely snaps on which is a nice treat. I haven't tested out battery life because I don't use it much without a nearby power supply. It even has a USB-C!\n\nAs someone who fully understands Microsoft and their \"philosophy,\" this will be something that will put them on the map into the tablet world. I can't compare it to previous versions.\n\nI can only tell you this thing is awesome!\n\nBetter than any Windows based laptop in my opinion. Hell, even faster than my R-11 Alienware with a 1000 watt water-cooled power supply (although Alienware installed a bunch of junk software that I'm finding difficult to remove).\n\nThis thing is a must for anyone needing a Windows based system to connect to work seamlessly in Teams, Citrix or RDP. Connect a 2nd monitor easily using the USB and a converter or USB-C. I plan to get the module that snaps into the side.", "I will focus in this review on the hardware, there were (and are) quite a few problems on a software level, but that's the fault of Windows, and those issues are probably nothing new to people who regularly use Windows operating systems.\n\nI bought it as both a replacement for my old laptop and as a tablet I could use instead of pen and paper in uni.\n\nThe Good:\n-light and comfortable as a tablet without needing to compromise on the functionality of a laptop\n-has good specifications considering the price and form factor\n-ASTONISHINGLY long battery life\n-built very well, other than the keyboard cover and a screen protector I'm not going to bother with a case of some kind\n-built-in kickstand is very sturdy and can handle a wide range of angles\n-screen looks fantastic in terms of image quality\n-the screen's aspect ratio makes productivity great\n-the speakers are better than I expected, nothing that's good enough for high quality audio, but it's more than enough in terms of clarity and volume to view videos where the audio quality isn't as critical as it is for audiophiles listening to FLAC files, so more than adequate for netflix or youtube.\n-the type cover surprised me with how good it is, granted it's not as good as a mechanical keyboard or a thinkpad keyboard, but for a keyboard cover it's VERY GOOD, feels as good as a typical laptop's keyboard.\nIt also connects very easily without messing about with bluetooth or cables, and even lights up!\n-I've heard a lot of criticism of the fact it's not very comfortable to use on your lap (like you would a laptop), but I've had no trouble with it, it's obviously not as stable as an orthodox laptop, but I have no complaints.\n\nThe bad:\n-very intrusive screen glare, I use it for note taking in uni and when it's lying horizontal on the table it reflects the lights in such a way that it obstructs my view of the screen, I haven't tried using the device outside.\n-palm rejection works very well with the exception of the very edges of the screen, if I want to write on the very border of the device in such a way that my palm is resting on the bezels, the line I'm trying to draw jumps all over the place.\n-speaking of bezels, they are gargantuan, making the device uglier.\n-absolutely not serviceable in any way, shape or form, this might not come as a surprise to anyone, but I'm disappointed I can't open it up in any way other than pulling out the screen a la smartphones, the surface pro x can have it's SSD changed and it's a shame the same isn't true about this device.\n-the micro SD slot is only capable of UHS-I speeds, so while it's perfectly fine for mass storage of videos or photos, it's no good for running heavy programs off of it, which would have been a huge plus considering how un-upgradeable the surface pro is, so you either pay a lot more for the models with higher SSD volumes or get an external SSD which gets in the way of mobility.\n-while this is subjective, the keyboard joins the awful trend of making the up and down keys half sized so that together they're as big as the left or right keys.\n-I wish Microsoft would ditch the proprietary port for an additional USB-C port, granted you can still charge the surface pro with the usb-c port, but it's not as fast.\n-no flash on the back camera, in a product like the surface pro the camera is meant to take pictures of documents, notes and whiteboards, no flash means lighting up a document you're trying to take a picture of is much more difficult, especially when you consider the fact the surface pro itself is big and blocks out plenty of light.\n\nThe Neutral: (things that are worth consideration before buying)\n-the cameras are not great, I didn't write this as a con because it's not meant to be used to take beautiful photos by any stretch of the imagination, but if for whatever reason you were counting on it, that's probably not the product for you.\n-The passively cooled models feel VERY hot VERY quickly under medium to high loads, to the point where anyone would be alarmed on most laptops, But having monitored the thing with temperature monitoring software the cpu sits on very reasonable temperatures (35-40c on idle and light loads and up to 65c on heavier loads, I've never gotten it to 70c) so this is probably just a side effect of the passive cooling.\nI'm writing this review in winter, so the warmth is actually fairly pleasant, but I don't know how well it would handle very hot summers like we get here.\n\nDespite writing many cons here I'm very pleased with the device, it does what it's meant to and more than I expected and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a tablet type device for taking notes and lazy internet browsing but doesn't want to give up the functionality of a proper laptop.\nThat is assuming you don't do anything very demanding on your laptop like high level gaming or running AI training.", "First and foremost, I am a Mac person not a Windows person. But this is so much better than an iPad. It is a full PC in the form of an iPad. So much more functional and better. I use this all the time and bring it and my MacBook on trips. Sometimes it is great to just use a screen vs. a full laptop.", "I was unlucky enough to receive a product with a faulty screen initially. This is upsetting and fear inducing - what with the investment involved - but overall Amazon's amazing support made it essentially painless to replace the product. To clarify, the screen issue is one in which a rare number of Surface Pro units have screen digitizers that are susceptible to even low amounts of heat. Do regular work that may be slightly intensive - like Photoshop - can heat up the device (the i5 model in my experience) just enough that the screen will have very obvious faults; namely, horizontal rows of black or non-activating pixels (typically near the top-most bezel) and a weird flickering and ghosting effect - the flickering being incredibly annoying, the ghosting of images making the device nigh unusable.\n\nBut it's rare, and it's not worth judging the product I ended up with - or the ecosystem of products that already exists - on these faults. Everything has faults from time to time. iPhones are notorious for them. Dells and HPs have them. So we'll move on to say that the Surface Pro 7 i5 (with 256gb of storage) is an incredible little beast. It's multi-functionality is somehow elegant while not being elegant. A slab is elegant - there are no parts to futz with. A Surface has a detachable keyboard cover, a magnetizing pen, and a built-on kick-stand. But I LOVE futzing with these things. They aren't cumbersome. They aren't annoying to deal with. They do exactly what they're suppose to do with no real effort required. It's great. The keyboard cover is amazingly comfortable to type on, featuring what feels like rubberized key-caps (I don't know if they are or now, but they feel incredible). The pen (The Surface Pen, not the new flat one) is also amazing to work with. I wasn't sure what to make of it's asymetrical barrel shape at first, but it causes no issue is holding or using it for long periods, and writing and drawing with it are intuitive and easy. I love drawing on this things. Almost zero lag from either the Surface Whiteboard software to Adobe's Photoshop. It's great. The Arc Mouse! People don't tend to like it, but I love this things. Impossibly slim when flattened, and just high enough arch support when curved, with a touch sensor mouse button that also acts like the keyboard touch pad with touch gesture commands. It's a little thing, but I use it constantly. Even the built-in digital keyboard is super responsive and easy to use. Whether all the bells and whistles are connected and ready for work, or none of them are, it's a solid product. I wish more manufacturers would use the magnetic features Microsoft has in this thing - it's so convenient. The Surface Pro 7 does not disappoint. In using the device. In how gorgeous the brushed black look is. In overall performance (the i5 can run Halo: The Master Chief Collection at 30 fps on default settings). Even the wifi built in is superb, outperforming every other device is quality and distance (it stays connected to my router even when on the other devices disconnect, and it stays connected. Just quality all around. Love it.", "I prefer a laptop the surface is more tablet than laptop. I have recently began using the device knowing my laptop can't continue working forever (it's getting old). The Surface Pro and I just are not good friends, but it was expensive to not use it. I have been making a point to use it daily for the past month. July 30, 2022 I tried to power it on and it would not power up. I'm sure it's in the power switch, but still dead with very limited use. Very Disappointing.", "Battery life is way less than the 10 plus hours listed in the description. i only get about 2.5 hours of life before having to charge the battery (3 hours is my best time)", "Everything worked great until the 2 year support window closed. Closed 08/12/2022 and I\u2019ve started having issues on 08/13/2023. My boyfriend got a dell at the same time and no issues yet. Do not buy", "vacation and away from home. Easy to carry around.", "I bought this as a secondary windows portable, primarily for use in routine tasks when I did not want to be tied to my desk. I use it like a laptop, so there may have been less expensive, more traditional options that would have done the job, but I have been curious about Windows tablets, so when this came up for sale with the cover included, I jumped on it. The utility of this machine, as with any computer, is going to depend on the tasks you want to perform with it. Since I mostly use it for document editing, I can't imagine using it in tablet mode would be a very good experience. The Type Cover is always attached.\n\nIt actually doesn't work so well sitting on a lap. On my short-legged, overweight frame, the stand is not sufficient to keep the tablet from falling off. I have not used it in tablet mode, but i notice that it gets rather warm. Leaving the cover on and folding it to the back should provide enough insulation. Feeling the keys press as you hold it is a little disconcerting, but the system knows to ignore that when the keyboard is at the back.\n\nAs with any compact keyboard, the Type Cover makes some compromises to save space. I would have happily given up some real estate on the spacebar, cursor keys, and left Ctrl key to get at least another Ctrl key on the right. As a visually impaired user, I also wish there was another way to tell whether the function keys are going to be function keys or perform their alternate functions when pressed besides a light under the Fn key. It seems the function toggles even when the Fn key is being used in conjunction with other keys. For example, when editing, one can use the Fn pluss arrow keys to access Home, End, Pgup and Pgdn keys. This is handy, but also seems to toggle the function key row.\n\nPerformance is good, at least for daily tasks. I have not done anything to tax the machine, but I do not notice a significant difference between the Surface and my more powerful desktop PC with routine activities. The facial recognition feature for login works great, even with my inability to look at the camera. I don't know what that means regarding the system's ability to be fooled, but that doesn't concern me at the moment.\n\nI've had the Surface just a few weeks, but it is serving it's purpose well, even though I do have to use it on a TV tray. A traditional laptop might have served me better, but I am not unhappy with my purchase. It's compact, looks neat, and performs well. If you live in a Windows world and want a tablet, this is a good choice. In my view, the Type Cover inclusion is a must.", "Purchased this Surface Pro-7 about 3 weeks ago. Fast shipping, 2 days. I gave it 4 stars because nobody reads the 5 star or 1 star ratings. I use it about 2-3 hours per day, web surfing, word documents, excel (no gaming, no graphics design). I'm happy, it does everything I need it to do. Intel core i5; 8Gb ram/ 25G drive. I think the battery life is good, but I only use the battery 2-3 hours before I put it back on the charger.\n\nUntil a couple days ago the screen would freeze for about 6 seconds every 30 seconds. Very annoying and a commonly reported problem. I finally fixed it by:\n1) Installing \"Intel Graphics Command Center\" from the Microsoft store. 2: Click the 4th icon in the left column and then Click the \"POWER\" tab. 3: turn off \"Panel Self Refresh\" and turn off \"Display Power Savings\". 4: Not sure you really need to reboot, but I did and the frequent screen freeze went away.\n\nI had a Surface Pro 4 since 2016 until recently - very happy with it. The battery swelled up and bowed the screen.\nI was afraid it would burn the house down so I decided to replace the battery myself, but after the replacement it wouldn't work anymore. It's possible I overheated it softening the adhesive but more likely it wouldn't work because I broke off the camera and microphone at the very top edge of the screen. If you decide to do this 1) back up your data! 2) don't insert the tools more than 1/8\" under the top edge of the screen or you'll tear off circuity that connects the camera and microphone. For some reason the circuity runs ABOVE the microphone and camera so they are much closer to the edge than you think. In the end I wish I had just sent the computer to a repair facility and let someone with battery swap experience do the job.

I used to have an ipad pro but when the battery died I decided to try this out, this versiin comes with a keyboard but you will have to get a stylus separately and trust me the surface pro stylus is the one you want, the knock off brands won\u2019t stay magnetized to the side and will get lost within two days.\n\nI\u2019ve had laptops and I\u2019ve had tablets, having the functionality of both is amazing. It comes with microsoft white board and microsoft to - do, I use the white board to make bubble graphs to get organized then typing it up into a to-do which has an app I can download on my phone so I always know my schedule\n\nBattery as you\u2019re using it lasts around 4 hours, but standby doesn\u2019t drain nearly at all.\n\nI originally got this for on the go editing, and for smaller scenes it works great, but owing 8 gb ram can\u2019t handle bigger stuff (not a deal breaker at all tbh) It handles 1080p footage just fine using sony vegas\n\nYou can also use this for song recording, I use presonus and I can\u2019t tell you how nice it is to be able to record and look at google docs for lyrics on the same device. One gripe about programs that monopolize the surface pro\u2019s audio device, you may have to disable the speaker temporarily to get the audio to come through headphones, bluetooth or otherwise.\n\nI haven\u2019t tried gaming on this, but tbh I probably will actively avoid that because I love having this as a creative work station.\n\nThe keypad is surprisingly comfortable to write on on just about any angle, which I\u2019ve never been able to say about any laptop I\u2019ve had. Being able to flip the keyboard back to aid in being a kickstand and not worrying about keyboard presses is nice as well\n\nSo yeah, stylus is amazing for creativity, being able to record, write, and edit all on the same device that fits on a music stand : priceless.", "It is decently powerful, I wouldn't try to go full bore on 4k video editing, or rendering 3d models.

It's not overly annoying to me but I am not away from a plug for extended periods of time.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised with the cover keyboard and touch pad...they are both actually really good and \"heavy Duty\".\n\nOverall the ergo on this device is great IMO it fits me very well. and it isn't so large to be obscene but it's so small that is hard to use. It has very little graphics capabilities, I was hoping it would be just powerful enough to play fortnite or some light games while on the road but alas It can only play some RTS and RPG (they are billions and Diablo 3 are great) type games. Shooters are pretty much unplayable especially in a online competitive nature...But this wasn't meant for games. Id suggest a ASUS G14 if you want a compact game capable machine. And I might have purchased that had it been out already especially since I pretty much always use this with the keyboard in a laptop layout. I prefer my Ipad Pro 10.5 for a media consumption device personally.\n\nBut from a productivity standpoint I really enjoy it a lot and look forward to getting a lot of use out of it...if the G14 comes out and I feel like selling this and blowing some extra cash I might jump up...IDK but so far Im enjoying this wonderful little device.", "The speed and battery are great.

Very disappointing.", "This is my first Surface product; so far, I am very impressed. Quick boot, quick response, and most practical to use in my line of business.\n\nI am an Investigator, always on the go, interviewing people, loss of fieldwork, and loss of typing in my vehicle. The Surface is very practical to carry, and having Windows 11, OS same as a laptop, I am able to get my work done in records time.", "My Surface Pro users love the this laptop. Low weight compared to most laptops with enough power and storage. Minimum specs recommended by me are i5, 8 gig RAM, 256 gig SSD. Higher specs are great but most users will never need.", "I've had this for about a year and i've been using it as a laptop for college. It's really only good for taking notes, as the processor is way too slow to do anything. It takes a good 10 seconds to load a new window or program. Something as simple as loading office or even photos take some time. It's convenient because it's thin, but I really only use it as a notebook when working on math or chemistry homework (in paint). For $1000, you can easily get something better than this, no doubt.

This was my second choice, but I accidentally placed the one i wanted in my \"saved for later\" list and put this one in my cart. This jacket seems to be of good quality. It is not very thick, so I don't know how warm it will be, but it looks like the levi jackets we wore in high school except with the sherpa lining.\nI am 5'10\" and 230 lbs, muscular with some belly. The XXL fits perfectly. The sleeves are the right length, the waist is right, and it is not tight on my shoulders. The material actually is stretchy. Which I did not expect, but I can rotate my arms freely with comfort.\nThe denim looks a bit faded, which I like, but it does not have those fake wear marks or tears that the kids wear today. This is a sharp, fashionable jacket that is ready to wear upon arrival.\nIt is not a jacket for new England weather, but I bought it for fall motorcycle riding.", "Overall a good jack except that the sleeves were too short for me. When I reach for my handlebars the sleeves were halfway up my forearm.", "I bought it for my spouse it fits a little too big which is weird cause i buy all his things in that size so i believe it\u2019s the make", "I\u2019m a medium to large adult male. But I ordered a large to be on the safe side. The sleeves were short and middle was tight. The buttons had a thin tin covering (one foil covering fell off on first wear) and are not easy to fit in the button holes. Sherpa was rather thin for my need.", "I have signature and Levi. Can\u2019t tell the difference. Great in the shoulders. It doesn\u2019t bunch up when I move my arms forward.\nGot this one because it\u2019s black on black. Wish there was an inside pocket. Still my favorite coat.", "Great jackets. I\u2019ll start by stating that the pictures on the Gothic color are 100% accurate & pictures on the Glowing color are not, there are 5 pictures up, the last one is the accurate pic, I was hoping the jacket would look like the first four pics. These are very light jackets in comparison to Levi\u2019s Sherpa Jackets I currently have, they feel very warm though. I threw both these jackets in a warm wash & high heat drying expecting it to shrink a bit, which it did, very little. I\u2019m 5\u201911 150-155 lbs and the medium fit well. Most Levi\u2019s jackets that I own, which is about 6 of them seem to have very long sleeves that reach my knuckles, I find kind of odd since I have long arms, great jackets though.", "It was well made but a little short", "I ordered this in both medium and large. Normally I wear medium in standard relaxed fit. I wear large in slim fit. I\u2019m 5\u201910, 168 lbs, 42R chest, 33in waist. The medium was much too tight in chest and shoulders. It cut into my under arms and actually hurt just with my arms in normal position. I could barely move my arms and I\u2019m not even a body builder. Could not fit a sweater under it only tshirt. Fit good in length of both waist and mid section.\n\nSo then I tried large... it was HUGE. Fit like an XL. Was so baggy and looked ridiculous. Massive size difference from medium to Large. So basically they don\u2019t have a size that fits the average man. So frustrating!\n\nSo many brands are like this not just Levis. I have same problem with Banana Republic, Gap, Lucky Brand, Hollister, and on and on. If you\u2019re going to make medium for a 38-40 chest then make Large for a 40-42 not 42-44 and super baggy.\n\nThere are more grown men my size than any other group. You\u2019d think they\u2019d make a size to fit us!!!!!", "Amazing price for Levi\u2019s quality. Just slightly thinner denim then the original Levi\u2019s jackets but I like that. You can move around in this one. Other Levi\u2019s jackets the denim is thicker and makes it harder to move around. Durability might not be as good as the thicker denim ones but I\u2019m very satisfied with purchase. All black one looks and feels great. Can\u2019t go wrong at this price point", "I bought the Levi Strauss & Co. Gold Label Men's Signature Sherpa Lined Trucker Jacket for my husband, and he just loves it.", "The fit was perfect.

He has a hard time finding coats his size, since he is of short stature and having a larger upper area but it fit amazing and he looks great!", "Definitely not high quality but it is a pretty amazing jacket. The stitching isn't as high quality as you can expect but you do get what you paid for. The sherpa is faux(fake) just letting you know. It's still warm and comfortable.", "Excellent seems. Sturdy fit. Made in Bangaladesh. Not in China", "Above-average build quality. Fits wonderfully. A female co-worker hugged me today while I was wearing the jacket, calling me her teddy-bear.

However, the price, color, and design was right for the size I needed, so I took the risk. I am so glad I did.\n\nAs soon as it came, I rolled it out, rolled it back up the opposite way from how it came, vacuumed it, rubbed the fibers with stocking feet, and vacuumed again. The fold was barely visible, and was completely gone in a day or two. I have furniture around 3 edges, so I was sure to lift one piece at a time and pull it tighter to release the remaining wrinkles during the first 2 weeks. It's flat now and we really like it.\n\nTo be clear, this isn't a plush rug like my more expensive ones. However, I put a thick pad under it and it is soft underfoot and to sit on. I will say the off-white fibers do trend to transfer onto black pants, but for the price/size, this rug is great.\n\nAlso not, the white is, of course, not white. It's off-white, but one direction is shinier, making it look more white in one direction.

We normally dealt with the rugs walmart sells, not docking them but they never seemed to be true to size. This one was totally true to size. I love how soft it is for a living room carpet.

Luckily it was close to the edge so I could tuck it under my bed but there\u2019s no reason that should happen.\nThird; this rug is unbelievable scratchy.

Fortunately, I didn\u2019t experience any acne breakouts.\n\nIt was really hard for me to lose weight though because of that condition and my diet. I used to exercise once a week but I wasn\u2019t consistent when I got busy with school. Because of that, after a week of school, work and everything, it became really tiring. I just want to rest and do more school related activities. So, I stopped working out.\n\nBut once the holiday season arrived. I noticed that I had been gaining weight. Even the people around me noticed and tells me the same thing. That\u2019s when I started to think that I wanted to lose weight and be confident about myself.\n\nLuckily during my vacation, I came across a blog on the internet by someone who fixed their slow metabolism and achieved weight loss with the aid of a supplement, Probiotics, to be specific. I got curious and decided to order the product online. I have done the same thing as I had read online, doing the same special diet.\n\nIn a few weeks, I had lost 8 kilograms and that\u2019s a lot. I kept continuing taking these Organic Probiotics with the special diet and have reached my desired weight. I really feel that I have fixed my metabolism with these probiotics which enabled me to lose weight. I also became more energetic with the probiotics and alleviated my tiredness, which had led me to go back on working out.\n\nSince taking these probiotics, I had lost weight, lost my belly fat, my arms, waist and legs got slimmer. I can now wear my old clothes, especially my old pants and shorts. I have some pants and shorts that was so tight, but now I can remove them without unbuttoning them.\n\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to lose my excess weight with the special diet alone. I had to fix my metabolism first with these Raw Organic Probiotics first. And the weight loss wouldn\u2019t happen if one doesn\u2019t have the other, so I followed them all strictly. But I also have some days where I can eat whatever I want, but I tend to limit it for once every week or so.

Healthier stools and a few pound weight loss over a months time.", " I have always been the kind of person to overeat. I would always feel painful cramping in my stomach and I would always take too long in the bathroom because of constipation or sometimes diarrhea. I felt bloaty and heavy with abdominal cramps all the time! I decided I needed to find some kind of product to help me ease the pain.\nI did some research and tried many products before I found and tried this one. Since it was my first time trying a probiotics supplement, I carefully read the details of each brand available on the market and this particular one offers 100 billion CFUs! So, I decided to give it a try. I ordered it to see for myself if it would help me with my IBS.\nWhen I received this product, I immediately started taking it. The first night that I took it, I noticed that the pain eased up and it became tolerable. The following morning, I felt that I was less heavy than before, but I was still taking way too many trips to the bathroom. As I continued using this for the first week, I really started noticing the changes. I was feeling lighter because the excess gas and bloating were gone, I noticed that I wasn\u2019t as gassy as I was before, and I didn\u2019t have out of control burps. The painful cramps were gone. I really felt less stressed because I wasn't having to take so many embarrassing trips to the bathroom all throughout the day...especially trips that took forever. I was more regular. I feel so much better because I'm not getting constipated or having diarrhea while using this product. My stools are even looking healthy. It has definitely helped me in so many ways! I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone suffering from IBS, or anyone that has trouble with gas and bloating. It definitely helped me...", "These are the first probiotics that have worked for me. The only problem that I have with this product is the bottle has less pills than listed", "I had to write in after seeing a few reviews stating that there's \"flour\" in the capsels and no alive bacteria. I 100% disagree! I have Celiac Disease and if these had flour in them I would be grossely ill. So now that false info aside....let me tell you these do WORK! With my issues they have elminated all menstrual issues (no odor at ALL) during that time of the month, no yeast infections at all, and I have only been using these a few weeks. They are easy to swallow. Now, in all fairness if you are having a bout of a yeast issue (like I had), I recommend using 2 pills every other day during the 1st week. One pill in the morning w/food and the other pill in the evening with dinner. That gives these a jump at combating those nasty buggers especially if your body is overloaded with yeast. I had a really bad case of thrush on my tongue (changes in my diet, and the Celiac caused it) and I was tired of being on antibiotics. My tongue is back to normal and I have really great bowel movements now. I will be using these indefinately because they are so great. Not sure what other issues people who are giving these 1 and 2 stars, maybe their issues require something stronger than pre & probiotics. These work, they are great and get the job done. I have ZERO negative reactions from these and have only had positive results.", "I have had issues with my digestive system for years, to the point of having to know where a bathroom was at all times. I even went to a GI doctor, was diagnosed with IBS-D, and that there was really no cure. They essentially told me that probiotics were a scam and a money grab. They had me do a colonoscopy, put me on anti spasmatics, and told me to increase my fiber. None of this really helped very much. I kind of just accepted that this was my life for a little while. I started doing my own research and reading medical and university articles on what could potentially help me. I made a list of strains of bacteria that had beneficial evidence for people suffering with ibs. This probiotic had a majority of the ones that I'd research and was the only one I could find with such robust diversity. Decided to give it a go and try for a month and take one every day to see if it would help. What could it hurt anyway? I am SO glad I did. My symptoms are pretty much completely gone and now I only use the restroom 1-3 times a day in comparison to the 5-10 I was beforehand.

I tried both the 3X and the 4X in this Innersy brand. The 4X fits and the 3X is too small. Because they are a hipster style the top rolls down when I sit but I am used to that with this style of underwear. For this price I can put up with that.\n\nI tested the absorbency by laying it on a flat surface and pouring a few tbsp of water on both the absorbent and the non-absorbent/plain cotton sections. It took a few minutes for the liquid to soak into both, but when I turned them over the water had soaked all the way through the plain cotton section, and the absorbent section was dry on the other side. I am planning to wear these on the last 3 days of my period when I have a very light flow and am confident that they will work as intended.\n\nIt's difficult to find 100% cotton period underwear so I'm happy to find these at a lower price! So far the only ones I've found that are truly 100% cotton are these and the Thinx ones that are sold via Target (the Thinx website no longer has 100% cotton in the adult sizes). The absorbent material inside the crotch area is of course not cotton but I need the rest of it to be cotton otherwise I overheat and am uncomfortable (despite fancy marketing claims). The crotch is cotton lined.\n\nThese do make a small swishing noise when I walk, similar to ski pants, but it's not noticeable unless you're listening for it.\n\nMy only improvements for these would be to make the waist higher and to offer all the color options in all sizes. I like that the absorbent material goes all the way up to the waistline in the back.", "I bought these because period decided to come right before my trip to Vegas. They are comfortable. I wore them to a concert so I didn't have to worry about pads while dancing, or walking down the strip. Amazing for those not so heavy times. I have no idea how comfortable they are for the heavier days, but they work great for what I ordered them for.", "Things I love: Super comfortable! I get incredibly bloated and while I did have to order up two sizes up from my usual, these were extremely comfortable.\n\nThings I didn't love: The fact that I had to read alot of reviews and order two sizes up. I'm a size 20 (usually a 2x in most sizes). I'm 5'9, 260lbs. I had to order the 4X and they fit perfectly.\n\nNot great on heavy flow days. I went through 3 pairs of panties in about 5 hours on my heavy flow day. These would be perfect for lighter flow days and that's how I'm going to use them in the future.", "I have adenomyosis which means I have heavy periods. I use these on my \"low flow days\" (which are probably heavier days than the average \"low flow day\") and I am amazed how much these absorb. These are also great to use when you aren't sure if Aunt Flo is coming -or if you have a flow like mine that likes to skip a day.", "Larger lady with some really have days in my cycle! Say goodbye to leaks on those heavy days. I am a size 16-18, 5\u20193, around 215 pounds and ordered the 2x size. They were perfect. I wore a pad with these and finally didn\u2019t leak once on my heavy days or at night!!! I always have to change the sheets or being extra clothes and these have saved me. The ultimate backup!\n\nI wore these on a really light day alone and had no issues as well. I have longer periods and those last 2 light days my skin cannot handle anymore pad type products so these are great for that too. I am Buying more!", "These work Great! But you may need to size up, the leg opening is a bit snug. Other than that, Total Game Changer!", "I had 2 pair in the pack that was tight. I had to cut a slit on the side to help with my thighs. But over all I love them. I usually have problems at night when asleep but these bad boys saved me from the embarrassment of having to strip the bed", "I don't normally give poor reviews but I must say these should be only used as backups. If you're a person who uses menstrual cups or pads or whatever, this is just for that purpose. I wore my menstrual cup and eventually it got filled and began overflowing, I felt it and I was like, ok then I have these undies on so there's nothing to worry about as my day was busy, around 3- 4 hrs it began soaking and mess my clothe up. They fit well and all but I would not recommend using them alone. Please note that even though it may be used as backups, do not get too comfortable as you might just get messed up.", "I love these panties. These are my period panties. I love that theyre black so no stains but the interior of the panties is wat makes them unique. Its like a cotton, & small leather lining. Theyre the best when on your period", "These underwear are comfy and I haven\u2019t gotten one wedgie wearing them. They are perfect for them heavy flow people out there (including myself). Even if you don\u2019t have a heavy flow they are good as everyday underwear too. They don\u2019t look like diapers when you wear them and I couldn\u2019t really see the lining when wearing shorts/pants. I don\u2019t have to much to complain about. I give it a 5 out of 5 and would recommend buying.", "I went a size up after reading reviews. They fit perfect. They are comfortable and just enough stretch. They dry quickly. They don\u2019t last all day on a heavy flow. So for really heavy days I would suggest wearing a pad also. But overall good quality and it works!", "Although these work well. After a few washes they shrink.", "I was skeptical about period panties. However, no other form of period products work for me. I made the jump and do not regret it at all. Absolutely no leakage. Not even on the heaviest days. I highly recommend these.", "You can\u2019t wear these for super long or if you\u2019re bleeding heavily but they worked well postpartum and being able to throw them in the washing machine is amazing.", "Love that these are lightweight and breathable! These are made to use in combination with discs, tampons or cups as back up. Not made to use alone unless you\u2019re just spotting, end of cycle or have a really light flow. Sort of like a full coverage panty liner but way better. I can officially say goodbye to pads!!! Ordered 2 sizes up from normal size underwear per the instructions and they fit perfect! Ordering more!!!", "Definitely order a size higher than you think you should have to. I love these. They are comfortable, not bulky, and leave me feeling protected.\nEver since giving birth I feel like I\u2019ve had a lot more leaks outside of my pads. These help me to feel confident that I\u2019m covered.\nYou can\u2019t wear these INSTEAD of feminine hygiene products, but they\u2019re still worth it in my opinion.", "I have some Innersy underwear (just the regular black set in Large) and I enjoy that they're double-lined with cotton. I'm on a birth control that causes a lot of spotting and the basic double-lining does the trick on a really light day. My period is totally unpredictable on this medication, and sometimes goes a very long time at a medium-flow level. I can't use liners or a thin piece of cotton on those weeks, and it felt like a waste cruising through as many pads as I was. Also, it didn't feel sexy wearing a pad so often, and I wasn't getting to enjoy cute underwear. (I don't tolerate tampons or a diva cup well, and several people in my family have had TSS.) I like cotton pads, but they rarely stay all the way in place on an active day, and certainly not in all types of pants. So, I figured, why not try the Innersy menstrual panties since I like their underwear.\n\nThese are okay. I bought the light colored set, and was a little skeptical about it. On a heavier day, I do bleed through and it's also easy to stain the outside of the lighter ones while you're washing them by hand (which I do before throwing them in with laundry). It hasn't been a ton of bleed through even on heavier days at home and they're still cute. It's also nice to have distinctive color options, and I know right away which pairs are for my period (I have a million black pairs of underwear) so I would buy this color again. That said, I might try a different brand and don't know if I expect them to hold up as long as I initially thought.\n\nI had the impression that these were mostly cotton, but I don't think very much on it is. The lining is a little stiff and obviously several layers of some kind of synthetic material- makes sense, and I knew there was a water-resistant layer. But the main body of the underwear is also pilling up in a few months in a way cotton doesn't. These definitely won't last forever and I might try a different brand to expand my options, but I'd also totally buy these again. They aren't good on their own for a heavy day, but they also have a sturdy construction so they could be a great way to hold a cotton pad or liner in place (when the elastic on other underwear might be too weak to be confident). If I'm only bleeding lightly, I'm not worried at all pairing these with most any pants. They fit as expected (I got a Large) and they're cute enough to hang out in around the house without having to wear a pad at home. I'm home all the time in the pandemic, but would happily also wear these out with a back-up pad. Overall, they do the trick! They cut down on my pad use a LOT and also provide a way to make cotton liners more viable, which is great, because all that plastic adds up.", "So my review is based on using this for bladder problems I got after the accumulated issues that come with having my third child.\nI decided I didn't want to do the review unless I had one of the more expensive alternatives to compare it to. So I am comparing it to THINX since this is one of the most popular looking menstrual panties out there.\nStarting out, the price is a major difference in this line's favor. it costs roughly the same for three of these as it does for one of those other period panties. that is enough to catch a person's attention. so naturally I bought them.\nWhen they arrived I could see a huge difference in the presentation. These all came neatly folded in a little package together, not bad. Their expensive counterpart came in a fancy box with individual wrapping.\n\nNow for the actual product: they are nothing like the more expensive one, and not in a good way. The shape of these panties is really nice and you don't feel like you are wearing \"protective\" panties but you also don't really feel all that protected compared to the safe feeling you get from the other. There are no layers to absorb, so you just end up feeling...gross, and maybe a little nervous that things could go wrong at any moment. and while I know that these are to be worn with other protection, my problem is minor and I don't want to do that every single day, but I do want to feel like I don't have to run away and hide (and change yet again) when I sneeze, or am startled, or cough, or laugh too hard, or run to grab something... i think you get the point. so yeah, that is a bummer. Overall, I would say that you should get these if you are one of those people who have the same problem I have (too many kids = some inner organ displacement complications) or if you have light periods and just want to be on the safe side.\nBut if you are looking for a way to gain freedom from the pany liner game, these are not for you. They don't give you that kind of confidence, they just make you feel like you have at least enough of a barrier to make it to the bathroom before that second sneeze destroys your outfit and your reputation.\nHope this helps, have a great and informative day.", "These worked so well for me, especially for bed during those heavy days. I\u2019m finally comfortable enough to no worry about my sheets 10/10", "Lil backstory, I started my reusable period journey about 7 years ago.\nGot the lunette cup, which I still use, but I was still buying panty liners for the just started/almost done days, when a cup is just too much hassle to deal with.\n\nAnyways, this year, I've really not been feeling like doing origami folds with my cup, so I bought cloth pads.\n\nI started out using the cloth pads for my at home days and the light days.\nGood stuff.\nThen I bought longer ones for night time, because again, I'm just not feeling the cups right now.\n\nBut the cloth pads have no adhesives, just the button flaps.\nSo during the day, that's fine if you're able to adjust it and whatnot, cause they can do somersaults if you're really moving around.\nBut at night, that's pure paranoia for me.\n\nSo I decided to buy period panties for that extra added bonus protection.\nNow I feel extra secure with the cloth pads plus period panties at night.\n\nHowever, I discovered that with the period panties alone, if you aren't a heavy bleeder like I am (\u22483-4 tablespoons on my heaviest day), they're great to wear on their own during the days... at home.\nBecause if you are an active person, or heavy bleeder, if the panty shifts, you might be in for some woes.\n\nAs long as everything is on the grey catchment areas, I have had no seepage or leakage for a whole day and night.\nBut if anything lands outside that area, or where the stitching on the leg holes, you might be in trouble.\n\nOk, so sizing, I am 43-44\" waist, and the 32\" leg joints.\nBased on the sizing chart, I would be 2X but I had read that some said to size up because around the legs were tight, I got the 3X.\nWhich fit fine. They fit my waist, and fit around my legs, but they feel a lil loose.\nAnd they're stretchy, so I'm concerned that they'll stretch out to be too big for me over time.\nSo I'd say, measure yourself to be sure.\n\nTLDR: They're fine. Comfy. Soft. Stretchy. Good on their own for light-medium bleeders. May leak if shifted.\nThis is what works for me.\nCup outside the house.

They have a nice thickness so you don\u2019t feel like anything is leaking through the wipe as you use it. And the best part is that when you\u2019re grabbing one you get ONE and the next one is peeking out so it\u2019s ready to go when you need another. You don\u2019t have to do the wipe shake when you\u2019re grabbing one with one hand and using the other hand to hold the baby. It makes changing a diaper so much easier and quick. I highly recommend these wipes!", "Unscented for sensitive skin. These wipes are some of the best on the market. The price is unbeatable. It's 5$ more for twice the amount of a box from Walmart, which is 6 packs for 20$. They aren't thin, too wet/slimy or that material that's like a paper towel, weird, scratchy, skin-craeling type material. They work great in the wipe warmer and we use less of them because they're so thick and durable. Less wipes and wiping, means less contact with baby's sensitive skin. I started using them with my newborn, who is now a toddler, and even use them on myself! Highly recommend. Comparable to Honest Company wipes.", "This item is not only incredibly priced but are the best wipes ever. I'm an elderly woman with very thin skin and am 90% bed bound. Just mild wiping with softest to causes skin tears and I also deal with pressure wounds aka bed sores. These wipes are so gentle but cleans with minimal wiping. They can be used in place of wash cloths on the entire body for sponge baths. Great for all skin types.", "I love these wipes so much that I still order them, even though I no longer have a baby in diapers. They are so gentle that I can use them to clean my face at the end of the night when I'm not in the mood to do a full wash. I will continue to buy these for a long time!", "So thick and soft.

I like they are thicker, my husband doesn\u2019t but I do.", "These are really great wipes. I rarely leave product reviews unless I'm really unhappy or really happy. For my first kid born 3 years ago we eventually used the original Amazon Elements unscented wipes for most of the diaper time. Months after potty training I went to order another bulk box for toddler poops and prep for baby #2 and they'd changed them up. Ok, ordered the new Amazon Elements ones and they were ok but kinda thin and the top ones in the package would be pretty dry with the bottom ones soo wet. Got close to using them up, went to order more because I'm a creature of habit and they'd discontinued them! Now they have two Momma Bear kinds, both have mixed reviews and I wasn't loving the Amazon ones we had anyway so I went looking for something else.\nThese Huggies Special Delivery had practically all good reviews so I ordered a 3 pack to try them. I've since ordered a 6-pack and gone through half of those as well. Search complete, these really are their \"perfect wipe\". They're soft and thicker but not annoyingly so, enough that you can fold it over several times and not feel like the baby poop might soak through from the other side. My husband even commented to me that he thought they were really good, he could usually use one whereas he was sometimes needing three before.\nThey have minimal ingredients and I haven't had any sensitivity issues with them. They're unscented so no flowery or powdery smell, no strong smell at all. I also like that they're climate pledge friendly.\nThey are pretty evenly moistened. The bottom ones are slightly wetter than the top but not enough to be bothered and nothing compared to the old Amazon ones.\nAnd a feature I appreciate - they pop out of the package really well. 6 full packs through and not once have I had more than one wipe come out at a time the way the overlap \"tissue style\" packed ones sometimes do. These are perforated but only attached at a small section on one corner and it rips off easily as you pull it out leaving the next one ready. You'd have to yank pretty hard and fast to get two out at once.\nI've included two photos, one to show the perforated attachment and one comparing the discontinued Amazon Elements wipe on the left to the Huggies Special Delivery on the right.\nMy only complaint is them being a little expensive, but it's not so much as to disuade me, they clearly put some research and development time into these. In my opinion they're worth the cost. I know Huggies Natural Care are slightly cheaper but I haven't tried them so I can't compare. Perhaps I'll buy a single pack to try out but I've been very happy with these.", "These are my favorite wipes to use for our daughter. Even though they are a bit more $, I will pay it. They're so soft and she has no issue witu them.", "Seriously just good nice and thick and a good amount", "I wanted to try these wipes because I think the Huggies Special Delivery diapers are the best available. After using the first bag/container, I can safely say that these are not as good as water wipes. They're not as moist as water wipes, but they are textured which is nice. Overall, good product, but not as good as water wipes (to me, I know some people who don't like them because they're too moist!)."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B082XHTYLP", "title": "Biotin Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Hair Growth and Thinning Hair \u2013 Thickening Formula for Hair Loss Treatment \u2013 For Men & Women \u2013 Anti Dandruff - 16.9 fl Oz", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71u02F5seAS._SY450_.jpg", "ratings": "11,175 ratings", "description": "Biotin Shampoo and Conditioner Set for Hair Growth and Thinning Hair \u2013 Thickening Formula for Hair Loss Treatment \u2013 For Men & Women \u2013 Anti Dandruff - 16.9 fl Oz", "reviews": ["I have been using this for 2 weeks now.

If you've ever walked on marble tile floors in socks or when they get wet at all, you know what a hazard they can be (especially when we are coming in from the pool). I am pretty picky when it comes to area rugs in my home. They need to look nice but the ones that are in our high-traffic areas like the living room need to be durable. This is a great choice. The rug looks very nice. It's a low pile rug so it's easy to maintain. We did have to put some additonal friction pads on the back of the rug but that literally happens with almost every rug we buy. It was very easy to get this set up We opened it, rolled it up backward twice and it was flat and ready to lay on the floor. Some rugs it has taken us weeks to get that degree of flatness without any curling of the edges. The color is graded but it looks very nice and its deifnitely a rug that won't look direty five seconds after you vacuum and/or clean it.\n\nOverall this is a very nice rug at a great price point. I've paid much more for rugs of similar qulaity. Looks very nice in constrast to the white marble tile. Very happy with this product.", "This is a nice low pile rug that would be great for an entry way or a wide hallway. It arrived conveniently packaged in carpet roll, but once opened I had no problems with it curling along the edges. It was able to lie flat right away, which is very nice. The weave has a good amount of variegation in color, so while the background is a bone white color, there is sufficient gray woven throughout to keep this from looking dirty.\n\nThe Moroccan Trellis pattern is both classic and modern to my way of thinking - I really like it, and I don't see it going out of style anytime soon. The gray and while color scheme, combined with the low pile weave modernizes this in such a way that it looks perfect in my office, which is fairly sleek with stained concrete floors and modern matte black furniture finishes. I also think this looks lovely on the light wood floors shown in the description photos. It's very versatile and would brighten up just about any space. I highly recommend it.", "I ordered this to use in my son\u2019s bedroom here in our home, I also was thinking about letting him take it to his dorm room in college. However the texture of this is not what I thought it was. This is not soft under the feet. It is a very durable cotton, but it is not soft. It is not a plush rug. My son refused to have this in his bedroom he said he prefers the texture of the hardwood floor bare, to this hard cotton weave feeling under his bare feet. He also wants something that is plush and warm feeling under his feet in his dorm room. I decided I am going to use this in my school classroom to give it a more homey feel in my flexible seating area. It seems very durable and that it will take a lot of wear although the light color also means that it will need cleaning. Rating 4 stars = Like It.", "This is the 3rd area rug I have gotten from Amazon and I am happy with them all.\n\nLike the rest, this one is well made and looks gorgeous on our hardwood floors.\n\nIt arrived fast and was quickly put to the test when our grandson spilled his juice on it. A few paper towels and some rug cleaning product and the rug looked brand new again. The juice was spilled because he tripped over the edge of the rug. Which leads to my only complaint. Because the rugs are shipped rolled which they have probably been for a very long time, you do need to weigh down the corners and sides to train them to lie flat, but after a few days that issue is gone.\n\nThe price is right for a run of this quality, you get what you pay for. For our home which usually has quite a bit of grandchildren traffic this rug is great for us..", "This one fit my decor perfectly.\nI like the pattern on this one.\nSo easy to have anything go with it when I change up the wall art.\nOnly thing I did have to eventually tape it down.\nI do have it on a hardwood floor.\nFirst I tried it bare like the rug it was replacing.\nEven though not a high traffic spot in the house it was moving more than I liked.\nSo I tried putting part under the couch. Nope didn't work.\nHad a nonslip rug mat that I put under it. Worked ok but still was moving more than I wanted it to.\nSo out came the double sided carpet tape and it has not moved since.\nEasy to vacuum to keep clean", "It's nice and durable. It's just that I was expecting a more carpeted feel. When I unrolled this, I thought \"oh, it's for outdoor use too\" as it was more rugged than soft. The color is perfect and the design offers a nice clean contrast. It's a decent size too. I put a heavy cabinet on one rolled end and some weights in the corners. It didn't take long to uncurl. While I didn't use a carpet mat under it, I do have these little rubbery drawer liners I may stick under the edges, just to keep it down and immovable. I wouldn't go less than 4 stars for this as it does look nice and could be used in a patio or bedroom.", "I was tired of the 5x7 I had in my kitchen and I wanted something a little smaller so this was a great size. This rug has a quatrefoil design and is made of 100% recycled cotton in Turkey. The best rugs are made in Turkey. This is definitely a rug you would want in a high traffic area. I just used the carpet pad from my old rug and cut it down underneath to keep it in place. I think I will probably be in trouble if someone drops ketchup on this because it is so late but it is a really good looking rug and seems pretty well made.", "Very happy with this rug! It is definitely true to color based on the photo. It is well made with a tight weave which seems that it will be durable. Took no time to lay flat and had no creases or odor. The only complaint I have is that the measurements are slightly off maybe by 1/2 inch on one side or another, had a hard time placing it into the corner because the edges didn't line up flush. Either my wall is crooked or the rug is slightly misshapen. Once I got it in place and put my things on top it wasn't noticable at all.", "This review is for the Unique Loom Decatur Collection Trellis Geometric Contemporary Dark Gray/Ivory Area Rug (5' 2 x 7' 5)\n\nLow pile rough weave rug with basically no backing. Lays flat without curling.\n\nGood for high traffic areas, and is easy to clean.\n\nNot a soft rug you would lay on with the kids most likely, as it would be harsh to any exposed skin.\n\nWould be superb on a patio", "I'm thinking this might be a great rug for outdoors, but not as much for indoors based on the material. It almost feels like sisal or a plastic-composite. It is not a soft rug, but looks nice. I'm using it as a back door rug to hopefully catch dog tracking and keep the area bright by avoiding a dark rug.\n\nSo far, it seems pretty resilient and I haven't seen any tracking beyond the rug. It also vacuums fine.\n\nTo me, this is a great basic rug but not something you want as a decor item. It isn't fancy, but it works fine.", "The rug is nice, it is a lower quality than I was expecting. The material is very synthetic feeling. It also looks like a solid color (with geometric pattern in a second color) but the green is actually kind of washed. Its a pretty color and looks nice in my room, but I think it is priced too high for its quality. It has several bumps in it that Im hoping will relax over time. Overall, I'm not really impressed but I would still recommend it.", "I have hardwood floors, live in a condo and I'm mostly covering areas to soften the sound of foot fall for the people below me. This rug is exactly as shown in the ad, and the photos are accurate for texture and color. What it doesn't show is the softness, zero odor, and it's supple enough to be easy to carry and place, it lays flat, but it's heavy enough to not slide around. I do have the carpet pad to put under it and that helps but this rug is probably safe for use without the pad. I recommend using pads though. It's great, I recommend it if you like the ad, the images and design, it's a great buy. It came well packaged and in excellent condition. This is not a wimpy carpet, I'd say it's a medium weight soft area rug, not stiff or plastic feeling like some rugs. It's well made back side and pattern up side, as well as the edges.", "This is a rattan-style rug. There's no real backing to it, and it isn't plush. It feels more like something you'd put under wicker furniture on your deck, which we might do anyhow. Right now it's under a dog crate protecting the floor. It looks really nice - it's a nice geometric design and I like the blue-gray coloring. Not the largest rug but would make for a good outdoor accent piece.", "This rug is a bit brighter green in color than the image on my computer, but it is a lovely, fresh, subtle green. The design fits in well with our other decor, and the rug is perfect for the high traffic spot at the foot of our stairs. It gets a lot of dirty shoes/boots there. It's easy to vacuum and spot clean. It seems durable enough to last quite a while in our high traffic/dirty area.", "I am using this rug in my kitchen because it's durable enough to hold up against all the foot traffic and it looks great. The rug isn't the softest rug, but it's thick, durable, easy to clean, has a flat weave, and is low profile. I would recommend using a mat to keep the rug from sliding around on the floor.\n\nOne thing that I really loved about this rug upon delivery was that it was wrapped tightly in thick plastic so it was well protected. It was simple to cut through the plastic, be very careful, and it rolled flat immediately. I didn't have to weigh it down for it to gain the proper shape.", "Love the pattern and colors but it's not very thick - feels more like a woven kitchen rug which is ok but meant I had to change where I meant to use it since I wanted something 'soft' to walk on in the living room.", "Some things still make me nervous to order online. Rugs are one of one. What does it really look like? Feel like? So much possibilites in my mind to go wrong. But this one is thankfully just as pictured and described. And is now in our entranceway welcoming all visitors.\n\nThe green colour and understated design is just what we were looking for. Tired of rugs that look like an Egyptian bazaar or a Southwestern Resort or geometric oh-so-modern monochrome blocks. This is a pleasing design of gentle colour and curved repeating pattern that does not intrude. Material and construction are good quality, this is not a $20 rug you'll leave in the college dorm. Perfect for higher traffic areas, or by outside doors. Gave me confidence to buy another rug online. Hope you find this quick review helpful.", "What drew me to this particular area rug were tow details which included the colors and the geometric trellis design. The colors are wonderfully vibrant and modern. When mixed with the geometric design it really adds good energy to the space and makes it come to life. I love having it in front of my sectional in the living room with a coffee table in the center. But I could also see it in a bedroom or front entryway for example. It's really nice and looks so expensive. Definitely something that I'd be willing to recommend. :)", "Got this rug for the home office. I needed something that looks modern and good, not too expensive, since it will be used in a high traffic area. I do expect the need to replace it in a year or two.\n\nThe quality of this rug is good. The color is good especially for an office environment. If I did not know I would have thought this is from that Swedish brand -- quality and affordable stuff. It arrived rolled up with a thick plastic wrap. The rug is thick enough that it unrolls flat quickly and I do not need to stick it down to our wood floor.\n\nRecommended.", "Beautiful large rug for my living room.

So I am limited to only the 16oz.\n- This is not \u2018double walled\u2019 so any drinks you put in this bottle with a large amount of ice will result in \u201csweating\u201d. Even though the lid does not leak, the \u201csweat\u201d gets my table, my bag, etc, wet \ud83e\udd72. Yes, I used a coaster, it\u2019s still pooling with water.", "I purchased the wide mouth 12 oz bottle.\n\nSomething that is unique about this bottle is the seal. Instead of an O ring, the entire inner lid is silicone. I do not believe it can be removed. I like this a lot, provided water won't eventually seep in. It's one less piece to clean, and the seal seems more secure.\n\nThe bottle over all is beautiful. The wide mouth bottle is large enough to accommodate ice even from a fridge dispenser.", "Always had this weird smell, and if water is left in the bottle for over a couple hours, it has a weird taste too. I wish it didn\u2019t do that. I loved the bottle.", "I found one of these water bottles at Ross and it was the limited edition confetti design for only $15-by far a great deal and the best water bottle I can say I have ever owned and there have been plenty! I searched on Amazon and there it was-the confetti glass water bottle! It was $20 and made well with thick glass and the full silicone cover so that if I dropped it I am sure I would still have an intact water bottle. Easy lid to take on and off and secure when on and no straw that gets gross and dirty. Will stick with this product forever. They come in great colors and fun confetti decor on the silicone as well!", "Great bottle, sturdy and sleek. Water tastes better out of glass. Makes a great gift too.", "I\u2019m so happy I came across this water bottle. It is very beautiful and functional. I was suspicious of the lid as a totally separate piece, but it opens easily and holds nicely in my hand as I drink. Clearly designed well.

I am so tired of seeing a plastic bottle sitting there looking like it needs to be thrown in the trash! This new water bottle is so pretty and it matches my cosmetic case beautifully. Good quality and very nice!", "I love that this glass water bottle has a sleeve. I don\u2019t feel like I am going to break it and it feels sturdy.", "I bought this bottle for my morning smoothies, since hauling around a NutriBullet cup all day just kinda sucks honestly. I make them at night and pour it into this bottle, so I can grab and go in the AM. Yes, it condensates, but it goes in my lunchbox (no biggie). The silicone sleeve makes it really easy to hold, it fits in my car cupholder, and it fits in my lunchbox. Highly recommend.", "Loved the design and everything about it until it broke after about two weeks of use", "I want to love this product so bad, and did until the second time washing it. Mold grew between the gas\u2019s and rubber barrier. Hard to remove rubber part to clean.", "Easy to clean, stores in fridge and in car .", "The upper bottle/neck is not protected and will break if it falls.", "I love this bottle. The color is lovely, the size is perfect to throw in a bag or car on the go, and the cap seals tightly. Good quality, but gave 4 stars only because traditional ice doesn\u2019t fit.", "I purchased this bottle in the pink terrazzo option, which has a very nice aesthetic. I prefer glass water bottles over all other materials, and this one is a nice choice. I also use glass bottles from BKR, so I can compare the two options. BKR bottles are shorter and thicker in comparison, but the standard size doesn't hold as much as the Porter bottle. BKRs have the advantages of a removable silicone sheath and a loop on the cap to hold the bottle. While it is easier to wash the Porter bottle without having to take of the silicone and put it back on, I like to have a sheath that's relatively easy to remove in case I feel I need a deeper clean. The texture of the terrazzo Porter bottle feels nice in the hand and has a wider mouth that allows for slim ice sticks to fit inside (though not regular cubes). Overall, I'd like both the silicone and the glass of the Porter bottle to be a bit thicker, but I still enjoy it!", "I love this bottle! The \u2018confetti\u2019 pink is what initially sold me, but once I received it I realized how soft and beautiful the silicone is. It is really easy to clean with a bottle brush, or pop right into the dishwasher. The cap is one single piece, so it doesn\u2019t get moldy or gross easily since there aren\u2019t many nooks for bacteria to build up in.\n\nI don\u2019t really put it to the \u2018leakproof\u2019 test as I take it from my work bag to my desk and back, but in my personal use I have had no issues with leaking.\n\nAnother awesome extra is the customer service!! I accidentally chewed up the lid in the garbage disposal, and was really disappointed that my $40 water bottle just became useless. I reached out to the company, who quickly responded to my query about a replacement and shipped one free of charge as a courtesy. Will be a forever customer at this point!", "The wide mouth makes it perfect for the dishwasher to get in and really clean this bottle. It's so easy.

I found this 6 item set which worked out to a little bit more per unit than I pay at my local supermarket, but nothing crazy like the insane markup on some of the national brands. It does seem to work well enough, but I did notice something kind of strange. I mean I've bought different oxymetazoline HCL products for years from a plethora of different brands, but they've all been pretty much the same. I usually consolidate them into a better atomizer I own than using the bottle they come in. When I was pouring the first one of these into the other bottle I noticed that it wasn't super clear like all the others I've used over the years. In fact it was so viscous that it was almost gelatinous. Every other one I've ever had was basically as thin as water. This one took a long time to pour out and transfer to the other bottle. So that's kind of weird. There has to be some kind of thickening ingredient in it that is out of the ordinary. Still, it relieves my congestion so I have to believe it's that way by design. I just feel like it's so thick that it's more likely to clog up an atomizer and it's annoyingly slow to pour. I guess if my store brand continues to be hard to find I would buy these again, but otherwise the formulation of the substrate seems off to me.", "I normally purchase Dristan but I was shocked by high the price has gone. There was no way I was going to pay $8 or more for 1 bottle. I did a search for the active ingredient and came upon Major and a couple of others.

I suffered from really bad dandruff (scaling/peeling) for 4 years straight after neglecting my hair for so long due to stress. And this product worked like a miracle.

Literally I would have dandruff on my scalp in two days after washing and it was so embarrassing to have dandruff fall off on my shirts, but after using this product I have no more itching, scaly dandruff and flare ups. I wanted to cry because, I was so desperate for a product and didn\u2019t want to go to a dermatologist, because they will just prescribe a topical cream and I can\u2019t use creams on my scalp since I have locs and that causes build up. I even use it for my face now , since I suffer from hormonal acne and it cleared up my skin almost instantly as well. I used a dime size amount to 4 sections and rubbed my scalp and left the product in for 2-3 mins. They say wait for 5 mins, but I honestly don\u2019t like staying in the shower that long. I washed my hair 3 times with this shampoo and followed up with a moisturizing shampoo and rinsed. The only downside is that the shampoo is very drying to your hair, so I would recommend to either dilute with another moisturizing shampoo or use a moisturizing shampoo afterwards on your hair.

The worst!\nWe had a arsenal of dandruff shampoos and none of them worked. The tar smelt horrible and I swore of chemical solutions. When I turned 27 and my scalp was worse than ever, I hit a breaking point. I was done with natural remedies. I wanted something that worked.

The itching and scaling continued for the first three washes or so, then I noticed... It was starting to work! I could feel a difference on my head that went beyond a surface level solutions. I also ordered and still use a shampoo brush which is amazing for getting off all the dead skin and working in the active ingredient.\n\nIt's been months since I've seen a single flake on my head.

The operating system and built-in apps are slow and clunky, and worst of all there are ADS EVERYWHERE. Even if you opt-out of all privacy choices, you will be shown ads on the TV interface from Samsung. The only way to truly get rid of them is to disconnect the TV from the internet (wifi/ethernet) completely. Which works for me, I don't want to use the awful built-in software or the slow unresponsive apps. But buyers who want an all-in-one smart TV, be aware: you're paying thousands of dollars for the privilege of being shown ads. Ads should subsidize the cheapest products, not the top end.

So the fact I'm giving this TV a 5/5 the day after trying it out means a lot. I usually wait a month or two - but I've seen enough!\n\nPRIVACY\n\nMy biggest hesitation in buying a television over a projector was the fact they all come with bloated apps, malware, and sell your data to companies. Some of the worst examples of this have manufacturers tracking everything you're watching and data going through your home network.\n\nSony gets an A+ here because in the install process they let you opt out. Sony has always been very good about privacy implications, which is the only reason I even bought this TV. Everyone else is sneaky about forcing you to agree to tracking.\n\nUSER INTERFACE - Performance\n\nMy second biggest concern with getting a TV was that I've always seen these user interfaces lag. I hate lag, no one likes lag, it makes you feel frustrated. The apps that I saw my friends use on their devices were slow, sometimes taking multiple seconds just to show basic information.\n\nThe processor in this TV is crazy. I've not only never seen lag, but the TV remembers what you were last doing in apps so you can easily swap between apps. Truly unbelievable they achieve this without lag, this television often feels more like a computer.\n\nUSER INTERFACE - User Experience\n\nI've been developing user interfaces for 10 years now. I've seen a lot of horrible interfaces. This though.. this is one of the absolute best.\n\nYour dashboard entirely customizable with apps you want to use. The dashboard is great at showing you content from each app that you want to see without having to dig for it. As an example, the news app shows latest news that's relevant. Or the music app shows your recently played playlists. Amazing.\n\nThe UI is great, but what is more amazing is that each app has its own well-designed interface. Truly the individual apps for Netflix, Google Music, and others are even better than the companies that made those apps have developed. I would take Sony's app interfaces over the others any day. So good.\n\nIt's hard to believe Sony made such a killer UI for its products and the products of other companies, and yet, they did.\n\nANDROID OS\n\nI've always been an android guy. Naturally this TV integrates with my entire ecosystem of Android and Google products. You get deep integration with the Google Assistant, all the Google products, and if you have an android phone you can easily pair/cast it. And without hassle! I was very impressed with how simple everything I wanted to do was.\n\niPhone users also get Air Play and other goodies too.\n\nSOUND QUALITY\n\nIf you care about sound quality you're going to always skip the tv speaker and use your own hardware. That's the truth here too, but the default sound quality is above average. Very good lows, highs, and hearing conversations in noisy moments is well done.\n\nPICTURE QUALITY\n\nAs another review said, the tv gravitates towards a darker picture. I had no trouble modifying this, and the settings to quickly do this from one moment to another is extremely simple. Otherwise, this has been my first 4k tv so I can't give a great comparison, but I'll say the opening sequence had my mouth dropped :)\n\nAPP STORE\n\nThis is just a notice that you can (and should!) install more apps for your tv. If you want to add apps in the Play store that Sony doesn't offer you can \"sideload\" them. I love that advanced users have this option!\n\nThe App store Sony gives access to by default is also extremely good, with plenty of apps for all uses cases, even techie users who might want to do crazy things like SSH into their device or run a file server.\n\nOVERALL\n\nThis unit nailed every single thing I was weary of, and over-delivered everywhere else. I would buy this device again in a heartbeat. Keep it up Sony, you truly are a wonderful manufacturer.", "I been wanting to buy a new tv for some time now but after doing my own research i ask myself what features i want in my new tv. built in android Google play store and two fit my budget. so I gave this sony tv a try even though there so many mix reviews I still bought it to try it out myself. First of all im happy it arrived in one piece nothing is broken or missing. This tv looks bit fragile so be careful installing the feet and setting it up. I love that the sony tv comes built in android Google play store so I don't have to go out my way to buy a android tv box. Since I got this tv I been having a bit of small issues with Google assistant but that doesn't bother me since i don't use voice search to be honest im sure I can fine a way to fix it but I'm ok without it.\nAlso i had problems with the Sony Bluetooth connecting different Bluetooth headphones and earphones and speakers and gamecontroller. For days i try connecting them and nothing. I was upset for awhile because at night I dont like disturbeding my family members with my tv been loud so I would connect any Bluetooth headphone to my old smart TV and never had problems but since I got the sony tv I try connecting many different Bluetooth headphones and earphones and speakers and nothing work. Untill I went to the Google play store on my sony tv and search up Bluetooth scanner for Android TV and there were a couple of different apps but only one was free to me and i gave the free app a try and it work. It connected all my different brand headphones and earphones even my main big speaker also i try a BluetoothGamePad controller and work. Then I try one game called Asphalt 8:Airborne with a old Bluetooth GamePad Android controller i had and it worked So far i had some small issues but I been able to fix them. Also the hdmi port on side are bit slim so make sure ant you plug is not bulky or won't fit. Its been a while i owe a sony product hopefully it last i do take care of my stuff. Also in case you want download alot apps I recommend you find a way to add storage.\n\nGo to Goggle Play Store> Search>Bluetooth Scanner For Android TV > Chose the first Bluetooth scanner for Android TV APP> Installed >OPEN> Scan for Bluetooth devices > allow Bluetooth scanner location click ALLOW>scan for Bluetooth devices> click on your name device when it shows up> Bluetooth pairing request then click PAIR> go back home > Settings >Remote & assessories >Bluetooth Settings >Then search for your device and click on it > chose Connect after that it say connected and ready to use. if it says not connected it still connect. Hopefully this help any of you. You can always delete the app if you like and it won't mess with the Bluetooth you pair to the sony tv it stay connected until you unpaired it. I did see some reviews saying that sony tv Bluetooth didn't work on different brand products then sony compatible products with the sony tv. Well i found a solution around it works for me. Might help you guys out. So far small isses I been able fix but I happy I bought this tv and love it.", "Our experience with the Sony X800H & the ills of its IPS panel leaves us with some clear impressions:\n\nFirst, and most important, this model does not display well in a dark room and is a poor choice for night time movie, Netflix or DVD watching. There is significant light bleed through when the original intent is to show a black screen with only a logo, title, screen credit and the like. Dark scenes are not Film Noir with this set as the bleed through spoils the dark areas particularly in the lower areas & corners. Frustrating is that when you watch a series, each between scene change displays a partially washed out screen when the intent was to show a momentary black screen. We could not shake the disappointment as we were used to our Sony X900F 49 inch TV which preserves, for the most part, what the original show is trying to display. In fairness, read on.\n\nThe TV's performance in a well lit or daytime setting is admirable. Very bright, clear and easy to enjoy watching cable content. Some of this enjoyment disappears if we put on a DVD or switch to Netflix. This is the perfect set for an automobile dealer to use in a customer waiting room or for a store to use as a demo unit. Again, watching cable news or main channel programming, the set was enjoyable to view.\n\nThe set we received was clearly a repacked unit and the box showed much wear & tear. The bagged set was in disarray and the accessories, paperwork, etc. were casually thrown in. Still, we have enough faith in Sony not to let this top us from trying the set and we gave it our best shot. We wall mounted intending to keep it and powered it up without a problem.\n\nNoted was a much improved navigating response time and a welcomed quick \"opt out\" of the apps which we avoid. We do use Netflix and hope to see Britbox soon but that is all. The power up, channel change, function change times are the best we have ever seen. On the \"con\" side however are two points that disappoint us: first, while the TV detects and automatically changes to a powered up DVD player, the TV WILL NOT change back to the cable box. There is an advertised setting for this be we could not find it. Secondly, the new simplified remote omits the important DVD functions such as eject, chapter change, etc. We solved this by using our X900F remote and it worked well but we should not have had to do this.\n\nIn Summary: the poor black level performance, absense of local backlight dimming, and excessive bleed through were the game changers. We love cinema and any TV worth its salt must display the classsic movies with 35mm quality. Despite the loss of time, the additional work and the inconvenience of dealing with UPS's unreliable pick up service, we are returning the set and will study the VA panels and the QLED options.\n\nWe hope these comments will help someone else in selecting their set. Cheers.", "The stand that comes with this TV is just so much garbage. If you buy this TV and want a quality stand buy one. This stand does not allow for effective cable management. Technically if you buy this TV to use as is the room should be a dorm room or man cave where presentation is not a controlling issue. This is not the TV for a quality room if you use the stand that comes with this TV.\n\nHorrible as the stand is that comes with this TV it is very easy to attach the included TV stand. A philips head screw driver, a little elbow grease and the most basic common sense is all you need to set this TV correctly on its cheap perch. The TV has a better than most picture quality. The picture quality on these 2 mid price Sony's is far and away better than the garbage picture I had on the two cheap Samsungs the Sony's replace!\n\nI've never had problems with Sony products. I have an 85 inch Sony TV that has given great service for almost three years now. The star ships look so good on my 49 inch Sony it almost makes me home sick. LOL! The other awesome thing is it has many HDMI connections so you can hook computers, gaming consoles and other stuff to it without issue.\n\nI brought my Sony 49 inch TV on Prime Day so I got a small break on the price. I usually wait till black Friday but, with COVID19 running amuck, who knows what struggles the future might bring. I brought my extra freezer for meat storage early and now finding a freezer for sale is extremely difficult. I'm buying my Christmas TV's now to avoid the uncertainty of our times.\n\nI need these huge 49 inch TV's to work from home and for my gaming after office hours. I have low vision and these TV's make everything on my computer screen HUGE! I have pre-diabetes and bad eye sight due to brain damage. These TV's make everything huge without buying expensive special magnification software.", "I've had this TV for about seven weeks and still get excited every time I watch shows and movies on it. Last night I watched the two part episode Once Upon a Time on DVD from the original Hawaii Five-O TV series and couldn't believe how much I enjoyed it compared to my old 1080P set. As a recovering audiophile I try very hard not to get too obsessive over picture quality etc. but it's impossible to deny that better picture quality makes a huge difference in how much you enjoy watching shows and movies.\n\nMotion Blur:\nThe first thing I noticed with this set was the lack of motion blur, one youtube review estimated the response time to be about 5 ms which was not as good as the much more expensive OLED TVs but better than the QLED TV I was considering. I've become much more aware of camera movements with this set.\n\nImage Depth:\nThe second thing that stood out was depth, scenes look much more three dimensional with this set which really adds to the realism of a scene.\n\nColor Accuracy:\nThe third thing I noticed was the color accuracy, flesh tones look totally natural and I haven't once found myself thinking that I need to make an adjustment to the settings. I've seen reviews calling the picture dark but that hasn't been the case for me, I recently subscribed to consumer reports and they generously shared their settings for this set which were done using professional calibration tools which was well worth the cost of the subscription.\n\nAudio:\nThe audio is good enough that I haven't felt the need to add a sound bar or home theater sound system but I may try it in the future.\n\nReliability:\nLastly and one the main reasons I chose this set is the reliability which is reportedly top notch. My first Sony TV was a tube set purchased in the 80's which lasted over 20 years. I've read horror stories from Amazon customers who bought other brands talking about the screen just going black after the warranty expired or the screen developing dead pixels. I don't purchase TVs that often and it was important to get one that would last a long time.", "As far as the tv set itself goes, it deserves 5 stars. However, having said that, the setup took over a week. The problem was that it shipped with old firmware which was somehow incompatible with my up-to-date WIFI setup, and none of the Android functions would work thus no Amazon Prime or Netflix. So, after spending a total of about 4 1/2 hours on the telephone with several Sony technicians as well as an AT&T technician, running a battery of tests, more than a couple of times, it was decided that I needed to download the latest release of firmware and install it.\n\nAfter downloading the software onto a thumb drive, the tv set refused to read it. After more conversation with yet another Sony technician, it was concluded that my 32 GB thumb drive was too big. After escalation to a Tier-2 technician, I was told that the tv set would only take a 4 GB or less thumb drive. Not having one, I had to order it from Amazon and await its arrival. Once it arrived, I again downloaded the 1.3 GB of software onto the 4 GB thumb drive, inserted it into the tv set and it immediately began updating.\n\nBut, I still wasn't able to access any streaming video. I then was back on the phone with Sony, and after being on hold for 45 minutes listening to what sounded like it was Azerbaijani Techno music playing the same bit over and over again, someone came on and after about a 10-minute explanation I was again \"escalated\" to Tier-2 and the new person led me through setting up a \"Hotspot\" with my smartphone with which I was able to then access my streaming sites. Voila! Success after only 8 days!\n\nThe tv, like I said, delivers everything I've come to expect from Sony. However, it being shipped with out-of-date firmware shouldn't be allowed to happen, in my opinion.", "I will come back to update at some point. Back...\nPros: It has great picture quality\nAfter sketchy start and resetting TV everything worked and apps stopped having hesitating video.\nThe familiar Android layout works smoother than my old one.\nSound is great and I've decided not to get another sound bar.\n\nCons\n1) little feet I looked but none were available with center wide pedestal. Why do you sell with skinny moderately spead feet? It definitely isn't as stable as a center pedestal form. Guess they hope it gets knocked over easier you'll have to buy a new one.\n2) connecting layout is outrageous stupid. Who looks in back of the TV and then upside-down? Need a contortionist to plug things in and I'm one short. I'm not the only one mentioning this issue. They say get a professional installer. I may be getting older and definitely can't move good anymore, but I've been installing computer systems and home electronics since the 90's. Which is why most of the family calls me.\n\n3) sound bar support is lacking. Limited list of manufacturers.\n\n4) Apps like Plex, Prime, working over internet is sticky after software updates. This might resolve with modem restart or setting modem differently. It did resolve but I leave this for others who can do this before calling tech support.\n\n5) remote is unusually long so going to have to watch how I store it. Layout needs improvement back key is back but needs an EXIT KEY. Update: getting use to the layout so things but it could use a backlight?\n\nFinal thoughts:\nRemote could use back light.\nPoorly thought out plug set up. Middle right and far right usb connectors and except for the usb ports the rest are not designed for easy plug and play. Even the 4 HDMI ports are spead out in two places and tucked underneath. Who ever engineered should go back to school.\nQuestion can I remove NETFLIX trash?", " I\u2019m just your average consumer and not a TV expert, but I couldn\u2019t be happier with this TV! Surprisingly, it\u2019s really hard to find a high quality, smaller TV for your bedroom. I recently had a Samsung, but I fervently hate their remote and their Smart TV interface leaves a lot to be desired. I really didn\u2019t want to spend the significant price difference between the two, but I\u2019m so happy I spent a little more and went with the Sony.\n\nI think the picture quality is excellent. I researched my models and I know it has a low contrast ratio (which means your blacks Look more grayish) per RTINGS.com, but I honestly don\u2019t notice. Everything looks crisp, real and high def. I love that you can hit the settings button to easily make it darker for when you are watching TV at night, or adjust the picture settings super quick. I don\u2019t use a sound bar, but it\u2019s great that you can adjust the onboard sound in your settings so commercials or sound effects are not too loud compared to dialogue. I\u2019ve always been searching for this type of volume control. And it\u2019s perfect for a bedroom.\n\nThe Android interface is awesome and miles above Samsung\u2019s. I always had to use my Firestick on the Samsung to use apps, but I almost never use it now because everything I need is on the Sony Android interface. The Google voice interface finds things quick, but the results are not as elaborate as I can get on the Firestick. I have the TV hooked up to my Alexa. It was a little finicky to connect, but I got it working.\n\nFinally, I love the remote! It\u2019s so intuitive, and when I instinctively go to click buttons I\u2019m always at the right button. It\u2019s lightweight and fits well in your hand. When I\u2019m next in the market for a living room TV I\u2019ll definitely be going with a model similar to this.", "I don\u2019t really use my x800 43 inch as a TV. Instead, it functions as my secondary monitor, next to a BenQ PD3220u, a display that costs more than 2x as much. Having bought a few 4k monitors and returning them, this was a massively pleasant surprise as the viewing angles are superb, and backlight uniformity in the very good range. It also surprisingly covers a P3 color space although isn\u2019t a true 10 bit panel. Thus it looks natural paired with a MacBook\u2019s internal display or the BenQ which matches Apple\u2019s color profile. The mere fact it holds its own against the far more expensive display is surprising. Is it as good? Nope, honestly close though.\n\nIt connects to my Mac Pro 2012 via a Radeon VII and also MacBook Pro 15\u201d 2017. There\u2019s no overscan issues nor necessity for color space corrections. I\u2019m honestly shocked. Turning the display to game mode is a requirement when using it for a monitor.\n\nI also played around with Android which is nicer than using Roku. I located the annoying adware software, disabled tracking and haven\u2019t seen a single ad. I haven\u2019t done much with the smart tv features nor do I use the TV\u2019s speakers. It\u2019s the first smart TV I\u2019ve owned personally, as I still have a plasma screen I\u2019m carrying a torch for, thus my exposure to smart TV features is limited to using other people\u2019s TVs. I don\u2019t care much for Roku. WebOS has a Wiimote like pointer but can be clunky, and Android is nice as it\u2019s a full blown OS which is a good or bad thing. Personally, good as you can enable developer mode.\n\nThe only complaints I have is: it could be brighter, most of the advanced picture stuff gets disabled in game mode (I don\u2019t seem to miss it) and a variable refresh rate. I really hope they keep making 43 inch TVs as the PPI is roughly 110, which is almost on the nose of what pre-retina MacBooks were.", "In the past I'd have cared a lot more about the kinds of features that the higher end sets have, but in my current house there is enough ambient light leakage that chasing super dark blacks and high contrast ratios is pointless, so instead I decided to just go for something as big as I could fit with HDR. I bought this to replace my existing 65\" LG 4k non-HDR set.\n\nI only use this as a display. I do not use any of the smart TV features in the set and I only connect it briefly to install the OS and security updates (since over time on other sets Sony has bundled display processor improvements with the Android updates). Beyond that, installing updates in the background is relatively unobtrusive.\n\nI picked the Sony mostly because I use the Sony HT-ST5000 sound bar and my experience has been that while all of these things should work transparently across brands, in practice there is enough underlying complexity that putting products together from the same manufacturer results in fewer encounters with user experience quirks. Sony seems to make a bit more of an effort to explain privacy features than Samsung or LG, but in the end you're bolting what is essentially a giant Android phone to your wall, and it will probably not get security updates after a year or so.\n\nI have been driving it with an Apple TV 4K and a Sony Playstation 4 Pro. It works perfectly well with both and I have not run into any weirdness - unlike the LG which would occasionally take a very long time to sync the picture when changing inputs and while it was attempting to enable its fake HDR mode with the Apple TV. Brightness in a room with a lot of ceiling lights is excellent. Since I have a relatively high ambient light level from lights outside the house at night, it seems to do a good job of giving me reasonable blacks and low level details.", "Sony still the best", "Updated: After working with Sony technical support, received a new replacement TV to replace the defective unit. New TV is working well. I\u2019m happy with it. The UI is pretty fast and responsive. Picture is good, although there is some backlight bleeding, as I have the 49\u201d, which doesn\u2019t have some of the fancier features of the larger models. For the price, though, it\u2019s very good.\n\nOriginal review: I purchased this unit for the holidays this year. Upon plugging it in on Christmas, it initially worked okay, but within 30 minutes started to show distortion with lines appearing across the image. It gradually got worse to the point that within an hour it was completely unusable. I tried all the standard troubleshooting steps: factory data reset, firmware update, running with no attached devices, checking different inputs, unplugging for some time, etc. Nothing helped.\n\nOf course, Sony support was closed for the holiday, so I contacted over chat the next day. Same steps I had already tried... same result. They escalated it to the L2 support team, which only works business hours. Several days later, I was contacted requesting photos, which I uploaded within 15 minutes. It's how been almost a week with no updates, even though it's obvious to me that the unit is defective and needs to be replaced. I'll contact them again this week, but so far, I'm going on nearly two weeks with a non-functional TV and no progress from Sony. So far, this has been a big disappointment on multiple levels.", "We are replacing a gen 2 Sony 40\" XBR LCD tv from about 15 years ago that is edge lit by florescent lights. This new 43\" LED LCD has phenomenal color, but it is much darker than our 15 year old florescent LCD...even on custom picture, brightness turned up, and automatic dimming turned off. If it had the ability to be as bright at the 15 year old model, I would give it 5 stars.\n\nUPDATE: Feb 25, 2020: We've been able to get it brighter by reducing the Black Level settings. Now we are having a 'picture jumping or stutter' problem with fast camera cut scenes, like on Food Network \"Diner, Drive Ins, Dives\". I've disabled both of the motion smoothing features and it still is happening. Not 100% sure we are keeping it.\n\nUPDATE: March 7, 2020: I've been able to solve the majority of the problems with the picture being too dark. We were still having issues with picture 'jumping or stutter', so I reached out to a high-end a/v store in the area. He said it's a great tv and we should buy new HDMI 2.1 cables, so I bought an 8K HDMI 2.1 Ultra High Speed 48Gbps on Amazon ($19.99). It has helped but not solved the picture stuttering completely. I have turned off all the motion smoothing settings and it doesn't make it any different. The a/v store is now suggesting that it's the quality (or lack of) from our cable tv provider (Comcast Xfinity). 4K HDR10 content on Amazon Prime and Netflix does not seem to have the stutter issue.", "First of all, there is nothing but good I can say about picture quality. Also the apps and antenna connections are on a common home screen, so no changing inputs to switch from smart Internet TV via Ethernet to broadcast TV via coax. This TV also turns on faster than any I've ever had.\n\nNow the bad: (1) Typical Sony remote and menus, presumably designed for people in a parallel universe who do not speak any earth languages or use earth people's logic.\n\n(2) Next the volume control will not control output to optical connected audio systems. If you want a combination of TV speakers and external audio, you have to adjust the two systems separately.\n\n(3) Last, I have 2 different Vizio TVs, a Samsung, a Sansui, and an older Sony. ALL unlike this one, have a remote button labeled zoom, or wide, or picture size, purpose of which is to zoom the picture, like if you have a lower res DVD or digital movie, and you'd like it to be full screen (either height or width, depending on aspect ratio.) Not so this Sony. An HD movie 1920x1080 will not zoom to full screen, much less a 720p HD program. I've searched menus (see Sony menu complaint above) and settings. Not on the remote. Not in a menu.", "Before I purchased this TV I bought a TLC Roku and there was a world of a difference. Setting up was easy and streamline. I was a bit confused that it was asking for Google play and Android connection since It said it connect to Alexa.I am a OS Apple user so I was concerned that I needed a Android phone. It did connect to Alexa and I just ignored the rest. The picture is clear and although not as great as OLED the color are detail and rich. I like the speed of changing Channels and volume. The remote control is awesome. We have the TV hooked up to an outdoor antenna and when we want to watch Cable we connect to the internet by pressing the AP button. You do have to download the Apps let say you want to add HBO, Disney, Prime Video and Youtube etc. I like the TV button where you press it and you are on local tv channels. There is a Netflix button and Google Play button which will directly send you to those providers. I like the voice command where.I can tell it to go to youtube to watch my favorite videos if you are on youtube search for whatever subject you want by voice command, and when I want to go back to TV just hit the TV button. The remote is slim and light and easy to hold and the buttons are very clear. I am very satisfied with this unit and still exploring the other options.", "1) It turns on randomly all by itself!!! How strange is that? I've googled this problem and apparently it affects other people too. Our tv's software is current and we've reset everything numerous times and as of today, 3/22/21, the problem persists. Our current solution is to mute the sound before we go to bed. It's VERY disconcerting and luckily it's in the living room and not the bedroom.\n\n2) The remote doesn't have a button that pages down when we view our cable company's program listing. Hence, we have to hit the down button every time. Our solution has been to continue to use the cable box's remote if we need to do a lot of scrolling.\n\n3) Once or twice a week we have to resync the TV with our \"Sony HT-S350 Soundbar with Wireless Subwoofer: S350 2.1ch Sound Bar and Powerful Subwoofer - Home Theater Surround Sound Speaker System\" by unplugging & replugging power to both the TV and soundbar simultaneously (simply turning the devices off/on hasn't worked for us). The fixes the problem every time of the sound lagging the picture. We purchased both the TV & sound system at the same time from Amazon.\n\nOverall, we're pleased with the quality of the TV and would recommend it with the above caveats. 8^)", "i am a very picky kind of guy, back in 2011 i bought a panasonic 65 inch plasma tv from amazon wonderful tv, still works like new, now for this sony tv i am so happy is it as good as the plasma, no and yes, the plasma has blacker blacks however i was looking at a night scene on the sony, and i could see a tree in the back ground, that i cant see on the plasma tv, because of the blacker black on plasma so its a trade off, this tv is so easy to set up wifi was a snap it has a tun of apps very easy to understand, the instructions are built into the tv is the samsung better or the lg i dont know they offer a few more features for the money, but i am very happy with this tv the skin tone is a hair better then the pasma, or samsung and lg, however i may send it back, only to get the 85 inch, and for the money this model is the one to buy, sony has upper line but at a very steep price, and by the way i called sony, on a tec question, and they were very nice to talk to, and answered my question just fine, just kidding going to keep tv big enough for my area, takes alot to satisfy me, and this does so in spades, remote is not bad 3 stars remote, 5 plus stars for tv.", "Background; I live by myself, and work all day long. Because of that, I have a lady broke into my home one day, which prompted me into getting security cameras. Good thing I did because less than 3 months later, a guy decided HE wanted to break into my house also. But the cameras caught him, and I was able to get the Sheriff to my house while he was still in my house.\n\nBut I really didn't like the fact that someone came in at all, so I started leaving the television on while I am at work in an attempt to make people think that someone is home. The problem with that is that I cannot face one of my cameras as the screen would set off an alert. Also, the light from the television, especially on cloudy days, would set off an alert. That can get very frustrating having to check the phone every time while I am trying to work.\n\nTHIS television has a feature on it which I love. I can have the television on, and I can turn the picture off. So now I can have the desired result, without getting so many false notifications because of the light from the television. And I am able to point one of my cameras in the direction of the entertainment center again.\n\nAs for every other thing about this television, I like it. I would surely recommend this television.", "I bought this TV because I read a lot of information that it was supposed to be very good for fast action in sports. Most of the time it is good, but sometimes when I'm watching football, the ball gets blurry when it is going through the air on a pass. I'm a little disappointed because I expected the technology to be better.", "Some knowledge you should have is that this is an IPS display as opposed to the more common VA. The difference is that an IPS has a better viewing angle at the expense of contrast ratio. That means it is ideal for putting in a room where people see it from many angles, such as a den or game room. Ours is wall mounted above a mantle where it can be seen from multiple rooms in an open living area. If you are looking for a display for home theater or gaming and you will be sitting directly in front of it then you could likely do better.\n\nHaving said that, this IPS achieves a 1000:1 contrast ratio which is considered \"passing\" in quality even for a consumer tier VA panel. So it is one of the best IPS displays you can get and therefore ideal for applications where a wide viewing angle is important. Also, if you watch in a lit room then you do not really benefit from a high contrast ratio, (a fact that many people have wasted much money because they didn't understand).\n\nThe color, grayscale, and gamma were accurate enough straight out of the box that it wasn't worth calibrating."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086VR4QR4", "title": "SAMSUNG 32-inch T55 Series - 1000R Curved Monitor: 75Hz, 4ms, 1080p (LC32T550FDNXZA)", "price": "$249\n99", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61WNCVMVS+S._AC_SY300_SX300_.jpg", "ratings": "1,476 ratings", "description": "32\" Curved Monitor with optimal curvature 1000R.

I was a bit apprehensive about the stand that supports the screen as I read in the reviews some people had issues with the installation of the stand. Followed the instructions carefully and noticed that there are two grooves in the assembly stand that have to be lined up with the metal base.

For work, I normally used dual monitors, but working from home, I've been making due with just one 27\" flat 1080p monitor for awhile now, which makes it hard to read info going from one edge of the screen to the other; so I sought out the most aggressively curved screen that I could find and landed on the Samsung T55 series with it's spectacular 1000R curved screen.\n\nWith my old flat monitor, I mainly worked on one side of the screen, and if I needed to read info on the other side of the screen, I would have to physically lean over to do so, now with the Samsung T55 monitor, I mostly sit at the center of the screen and can work comfortably from one edge of the screen to the other without much strain with it's aggressive curve. Now, I do have to say, a 32\" Monitor at 1080p is not ideal for work, as texts are noticeably pixelated, and smaller \"copy-right\" texts can be unreadable without magnification, but it's something I can live with...\n\nI probably should have gone with the 27\" model of the Samsung T55 series, but I also wanted the largest monitor I could find to game on with my PS4 (I live in a small apartment, and have nowhere to put a large separate TV set). 27 inches is way too small of a screen if you want to be immersed in beautifully crafted game worlds; the extra 5 inches on the Samsung made all the difference, and with it's aggressive \"natural\" curve you can comfortably sit even closer to the screen, making this monitor seem much larger than it really is. Also, with the Samsung \"Cinema\" pre-set setting, the image is wonderfully vibrant with deeply rich colors, the new 'Spider-Man: Miles Morales' PS4 game I first played on with this monitor was gorgeous as shown in the pics included in this review.\n\nWith the Samsung T55 monitor, know what you're getting into, if you can't live with reading pixelated small text, consider the 27\" model if you're mostly going to be using this monitor for work.

Was having problems and wanted a larger TV to fit the opening of armoire but needed a pedestal type. I saw this 32\" monitor with speakers on sale Black Friday. Because of the curved screen it only takes a 28 inch opening so it fit perfectly and gives more and better viewing area. Speakers were fine, but I purchased a Vizio 20 inch sound bar system with wireless woofer also on Black Friday and the total setup is great. TV speakers were fine but my wife listens to music during the day so sound bar system was even better coming out of the audio 3.5 output. I was able to get my 4K Firestick to control the volume and put the monitor in sleep mode. Don't think turning the monitor on and off with the 4K Firestick is possible, but there is an on/off switch in the middle and under the monitor. I usually just put in sleep mode. Sound bar goes off automatically after so many minutes. I stream so my HULU, Netflix, YouTube picture quality is great. I did do a little tweaking with the manual buttons on the monitor. Where I sit is about 6 feet away and I can comfortably surf the net with my Firestick and reading and viewing seems to be easier on my eyes. Typical viewing is streaming TV with sound bar on. Put monitor in sleep mode with Firestick when I stop and sound bar goes off on its on. I do have to turn sound bar back on with its remote when I start back viewing, but I am typically playing with the bass and treble settings anyway. The sound bar can be programed to not go off but I dont see the need. The only thing the monitor does not do that I would like is show a sound level bar wit numbers on the screen, but hey, my ears can tell me where the level should be. I would have given a five star on everything if I had been able to program the Firestick to do everything. I am glad I made the purchase and highly recommend the monitor.

Other naturals I found I had to carry with me and reapply several times throughout the day, this stuff lasts all day for me. Buy it now, don't hesitate.", "Can't go wrong with Duke Cannon products. I have buying them for years. This natural deodorant holds up all day and smells good.", "Smells good, lasts all day. Best I have used", "*UPDATED*\nAfter using these for a few months I realized I cant pick a favorite in terms of smell! Nevertheless, now that it's getting hotter out I've come to realize that they simply do not last long, at all. Sitting at a desk, like I do most days, they'll last about 6 hours. On days where I'm out and about or doing laborious work or it's simply hot out, it'll last 1-3 hours. Yes, sometimes only one hour. Because of this I had to drop the star rating to 3 because it's simply unacceptable that any deodorant would last that long. If it was 6 hours MINIMUM for a hot laborious day then I would have kept it 5stars.\n\n*ORIGINAL*\nThese are excellent deodorants! I was a little skeptical of the scents at first and started off using only the Sandalwood & Amber stick until one day it lost it's sandalwood part of the scent and only smelled like Amber. I don't mind though since the other two have really grown on me!\n\nIt hasn't been particularly hot enough to really put them to the test but so far they've lasted all day.\n\nThese are very Earthy, Musky, Rustic scents. They remind me of things I would smell as a kid while running around in certain family member's rustic garden. The Fresh Water & Neroli reminds me of the smell of the manmade freshwater ponds my grandfather had in his yard.", "I\u2019ve been using this deodorant for about a month now. I can honestly say no smell, no sweat, no stains. The fragrance is amazing and lasts a long time tho not all day. What lasts all day is you don\u2019t stink. Highly recommended.", "Inched after about 8 hours", "My husband switched to this and I love it.", "Smells okay, if you want to smell like you rubbed your pits with a used dryer sheet. Weak scent, which is the most important element of a deODORant stick. Sure, I know charcoal absorbs smells, but come on! They couldn\u2019t add just few more teaspoons of the flowery/smelly-good stuff? I\u2019m sure someone out there enjoys these sticks as much as they enjoy smelling like a dirty hippy. I\u2019ll stick to Old Spice.", "I really love Duke Cannon products and I love the scents offered, but I can't call this a great deodorant. I'll get maybe 4-8 hours max of smell coverage out of these. For reference, Degree gets me 24-36. I've had such a great experience with their other products and I had such high hopes for this deodorant, but considering the price and the fact that I have to apply it 4x as often, I'd say this is a flop.", "It smells good when applied and after sweating for a few hours, what else can I say? There is no aluminum or toxic chemicals and it just works.", "Wife loves all the scents of these three items. They won't leave you smelling like detergent."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Z2XFK1", "title": "SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 10.4\" 128GB WiFi Android Tablet w/ S Pen Included, Slim Metal Design, Crystal Clear Display, Dual Speakers, Long Lasting Battery, SM-P610NZIEXAR, Chiffon Rose", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61jfI8GyQgL._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "16,935 ratings", "description": "With the Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite, you can unleash your creativity and leave your mark on whatever comes your way.

TLDR, a very fairly priced high quality mid-range tablet with great performance, respectable battery life, and a great display.\n\nDesign\nThis tablet is designed very similarly to the nearly double priced Galaxy Tab S6, with the only removal being the pins for the first party keyboard. It does however, gain a 3.5 mm headphone jack, which is a must-have for any high quality headphone user. It is made of aluminum and glass, with the only plastic being for the Wi-Fi / LTE antenna bands. Very modern and sleek with minimal bezels that aren't too small, nor too large making the tablet look dated. However, I wanted to protect this tablet for years to come so I won't be looking at the bare metal chassis too much, as I purchased a case for it. I recommend doing that, since it will keep the resale value of the device high, and prevent it from being damaged as easily. That and a screen protector are a must-have for this tablet. I recommend the Poetic Revolution case.\n\nFeatures\nThis tablet features, two speakers tuned by AKG certified for Dolby Atmos, facial and pattern unlock, the latest Bluetooth and Wi-Fi standards, a 3.5 mm headphone jack, an 8 megapixel rear camera, and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. No fingerprint reader unfortunately, that is something in the higher-priced regular S6. 64 or 128gb of storage. This tablet also includes a passive S-Pen that does not require charging and can magnetically stick to multiple places on the tablet.\n\nSoftware\nAs of 2021, this tablet is running Android 10, with Samsung One UI 2.5. Android 10 is a great operating system, but is even better when paired with One UI 2.5. Samsung really knows how to make a good tablet OS, but considering they're pretty much the only company who's making decent Android tablets, there's not much to compare it with. I would be here all day talking about every little detail, and I don't think I found everything yet. But here's some of the highlights. Dark mode, smart select which allows you to take screenshots of a custom size using the S-Pen, Samsung Notes which allow you to take notes with the S Pen, allowing apps one time or partial location only when in use, better battery management, better notification handling, and many other things that I haven't discovered or noticed yet. What you should take away from this, is the operating system is very well-balanced and has very few bugs that I have discovered, Samsung knows what they're doing.\n\nHardware\nThe Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite is running an Exynos 9611 Octa Core processor (4x2.3GHz + 4x1.7GHz) with 4GB of ram. While the processor is a bit weak, it is acceptable for multitasking and moderate gaming. This tablet runs Minecraft, Terraria, Call of Duty mobile, and Asphalt 9 with decent frame rates. Note it does not run fortnite officially, and unofficially very poorly. Some of that is due to poor optimization, but if you want to game at high settings buy a tab S6 or S7. It is perfectly acceptable for watching videos or TV, and the 4GB of ram makes multitasking very effective. It's much more powerful than a Fire tab or something cheaper, so it's certainly very usable.\n\nStorage\nBy default this tablet comes with 64 or 128 GB of storage, with around 20 GB of it being reserved for the system. It has plenty of space for all your apps, and a decent amount of downloaded content. Not to mention it also has MicroSD expansion, which allows you to expand the storage up to 2TB, not that you could actually find 2TB micro SD cards for a decent price, or at all. To save some money, I would recommend buying the 64GB model, and buying an SD card later.\n\nScreen\nThis tablet is using a 2000 x 1200 resolution LCD display. While it is certainly not an AMOLED display, it is bright, vibrant, and certainly high resolution enough for mostly anybody. It's actually visibly brighter and sharper than my old Galaxy S6 Edge screen, but that's a first or second gen OLED. If you want a high-quality OLED screen, buy a tab S5E or S6. It certainly perfect for watching movies or TV, and unless you are directly comparing it with an OLED you won't notice much difference. There is some slight backlight bleed but it is not noticeable in my unit.\n\nBattery\nThis tablet is using a 7040mAh lithium ion battery, which is unchanged from the tab S6. So naturally since this tablet has a lower power consumption it's battery life is slightly better, I went through almost an entire day and still had 35% battery left. As for the battery health, it's still perfectly fine now, but this tablet is less than a month old, so have yet to see how much it will degrade over time. Charging this tablet has been somewhat interesting. On my original Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge wall adapter it actually fast charges over the spec of the wall adapter. Measured on the app Ampere, the charger is rated for 2.1 amps but the tablet charges at up to 2.6. This shouldn't be an issue, as the charger has in-built safety features that will shut it off if it gets too hot or if something draws too much current. I've also tested it on an Anker Powercore 26800 power bank, and an Anker Powerport Speed 5 USB charger. Interestingly, it does fast charge using the blue ports on my USB charger, it does not fast charge using the black ports nor any of the ports on my power bank. It's not totally an issue, because it's only about a 30-minute decrease in time for the fast charging ports, just somewhat annoying. Keeping in mind all of these ports can deliver the current and voltage required to fast charge.\n\nCamera\nThe camera on this tablet is perfectly fine. While it's no Flagship smartphone camera, it's certainly good enough for scanning documents or video calling, since I doubt you're going to be hauling your tablet around taking pictures with it. The rear camera is 8 megapixels, and front facing camera is 5 megapixels. Both 1080P, and the rear shooter can shoot video in 1080P 30fps.\n\nS Pen\nAh yes, the S Pen. The S Pen is Samsung's claim to fame with this tablet, this S Pen is different from the one on the regular S6, as the one on the S6 is active and needs charging for the fancy Bluetooth features. This S Pen however is a passive stylus, made internally by Wacom and licensed to Samsung. Samsung made the right call in this decision, as the S Pen feels great, is well-balanced and not too heavy, and has minimal latency when drawing fast. Even though the S pen is made of plastic, It Is by no means cheap plastic and feels very quality in the hand. It does have replaceable nibs, as it rubs off a little bit on the screen protector I have. If you lose or break your S Pen, since it's a passive stylus it's only $60 for a new one. Still expensive, but not too bad. The S-Pen stows away on the side of the tablet with the point facing up, using magnets it is quite a strong hold and the pen is unlikely to fall off unless you bump it. With the case I chose, the pen is still in that location, just with a bit of plastic in the way of the tablet. This is not really affect the magnets, and the pen stays where it's put. Certain apps don't support the S Pen, but most of the first party Google ones and Samsung ones do, and Samsung has built in some extra features like screen write, that takes a screenshot and that allows you to write on it immediately, smart select which allows you to capture a custom size screenshots of most content except most streaming services, and some added functionality with Google Translate. I actually found myself using the S-Pen to navigate the tablet, rather than just writing. It's very precise and easy to use, and easy to put away when you're done.\n\nConclusion\nOverall this is an outstanding tablet, a very major upgrade from A Fire tab, or a cheap Chinese one. With it's relatively low-cost especially if you can get it on sale, decent performance, well thought-out software, large storage with expansion, great LCD display, and free S Pen, this tablet should be a major consideration in anybody's tablet buying process. 5/5 Stars.", "As I do read what other people say \"Daisy\"said everything I could say or even more so I will just copy her description, Before that I just want to add that I tried several High end Chinese ones which by the way are impressive on speed and perform quite well to be half price, but if you like quality, Samsung made this model as an affordable one, but still quality of video is excellent, audio best of best for a 10 inch battery an outstanding 7000+ mAh,and so I do recommend it completely. Now I do copy what Daisy wrote as it is an excellent analysis.\n\n\"Reviewed in the United States on May 29, 2020\n* UPDATED REVIEW after I used this tablet for a while now. *\nFirst of all, I usually buy my tablets and phones from Amazon, but at the time I wanted to purchase this tablet (the day it was released), it was out of stock, so I purchased it at a store near my home.\nAlso, I am a techy type, so the purpose of my review is to help you to decide if this is the best mid-range tablet for you (or not).\nBelow, I list the Pros and Cons that I discovered.\n\n+ Screen Resolution for a TFT Screen and Sharpness...First of all, the Display Screen on the S6 Lite is a TFT type screen, not a Super Amoled Screen, the ORIGINAL S6 Tab 2019, has the Amoled Screen. However at 224 ppi, this screen is clear and has a soft white appearance, NOT a super bright white appearance because of the TFT Screen. Yet I found that the colors are vivid. And watching videos on YouTube, they totally filled up the screen and the videos were super sharp! In addition, reading on the Kindle App is very clear.\n\n+ OS is 10.0, UI is 2.1 Samsung. I went to Software Update as soon as I received this tablet and this update enabled the double tap feature to wakeup the screen. Be sure you update it because before the May 2020 security update, the double tap did not work, update fixed it!\n\n+ S Pen...The S Pen works great and has several features I like. The S Pen is easy to use, it glides across the screen, no lagging. Also, it doesn't scratch the screen. To start the S Pen, just hold the Pen on the right side of the tablet, about a quarter inch away. Then touch the SPen Icon for the menu of the SPen features.\n* The SPen DOES NOT require charging, pairing etc. In fact I keep my S Pen in my Chiffion Rose Samsung Book Cover Case because it has a magnetic slot inside for the S Pen.\n\n+ Size of tablet/Screen Ratio\n1. l love this 10.4 size tablet because it easily fits into my large purse or my bookbag/backpack.\n2. Screen Ratio is 81.6%. The bezels are very slim.\nThis screen is wonderful for watching videos, movies, reading and I use it for MS Word, Excel and more.\n\n+ It has a 3.5 Headphone Jack! The Samsung S6 Flagship (2019) and Samsung S5e (2019) DO NOT have a 3.5 headphone jack! This is just one of the many reasons why I purchased this tablet. With Bluetooth Headsets, they must be charged and sometimes they don't last that long.\n\n+ Internal Memory/ External Memory Card Info--this tablet is advertised at 64GB Internal Memory. However, after the OS and Factory Apps and my own apps were installed, I still have 44GB of available internal memory. This is plenty of space for future apps, updates etc.\n\n+ Memory Card storage...I discovered that I can install an SD Card up to 1 TB. However, I installed (for now) a 128GB and still have 40gb left on it.\n\n+ Speed/Responsiveness/Battery Temp/Battery Life...This tablet is very peppy, does not lag or freeze.\nBattery is non removable, and it does not overheat even with downloading apps, watching videos etc. Under normal use it is 80 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit and after downloading apps, watching videos etc, it goes up to 90 degrees for a minute or two, which is normal, and it quickly goes back down to 80 to 85. I use the free widget called Battery Widget Reborn from the Playstore. It shows my battery amount left on my screen and when I tap it, it gives a report of how long the battery has been used and the time left on the battery.\n\n+ Battery Life: The battery is 7040 mAh, after it reached 100%, I discovered that the battery lasted longer than my Samsung Tab A 10.1 2019.\n\n+ WiFi...802.11 a/b/g/n, ac dual-band. I use ATT UVERSE and this tablet has superb and fast WiFi. Even outside in my backyard, it still gets 3 bars. I am very pleased with this tablet's WiFi. Also, on the road, it picks up local WiFi wonderfully.\n\n+ Camera...Note that this camera does not have a flash, however, with good lighting, the pictures and videos I took with it were pretty clear, not as good as my Samsung A51 Phone, but better than I thought they would be.\n\n+ Sound Quality...there are 2 small internal speakers so the sound is good, however I also tested the sound with a Bluetooth speaker and the sound is wonderful. Even my wired headphones sound great on this tablet.\n\nCons (3):\n1. Biggest CON I noticed is NO Super Amoled Screen like the 2019 Tab S6 has, instead it has a regular back-lit TFT screen which is not quite as \"bright white\" as my old Samsung S4 with Super Amoled. The S6 Lite is more like a very soft white, but in my opinion, the screen DOES NOT have any yellowish tint, just a softer white.\n\n2. Screenshots...To take a Screenshot, I have to QUICKLY press the Power Button and Volume Down button at the same time. However, my Tab A Tablet, A51 Phone let's me swipe the edge of my hand across the screen, this tablet won't do this. Hopefully, the next update will fix this. Right now, I am used to quickly pressing Power Button and Volume Down buttons for a screenshot.\n\n3. No DEx...The desktop/laptop feature is not there for the S6 Lite. Frankly I rarely used DEx on my Tab S4.\n\n* Should you consider purchasing this S6 Lite tablet?\nPersonally, I suggest YES if:\n1. You don't have to have a Super Amoled screen like the S6 regular has and you want to buy a reasonably priced Samsung Tablet.\n2. You want a very nice mid range tablet with the S Pen feature.\n3. You want to spend about 350 on a tablet instead of 750 on a tablet (for the Flagship Tab S6).\n4. You want a 3.5 Headphone Jack, the S6 Lite has it. The Tab S6 and Tab S5e Tablets do not have a 3.5 Headphone Jack.\n\nMy overall score is 4.6 stars, rounded off to 5 stars mainly due to non Super Amoled Screen, but I knew this BEFORE I PURCHASED THE TABLET.\n\nWell, I hope that this review has helped with your decision regarding this tablet. Thank you for reading my review.\"", "I'll preface this review by saying:\n\n(1) I strongly prefer Android to iOS as an environment\n(2) This review may not be entirely \"fair\" to Samsung, but it's fair to users/would-be buyers\n\nI own an iPad Pro already, but there are some significant things that I wanted from this tablet:\n\n- Something more \"holdable\" with a large screen, which you can't get with Apple's 4:3 screen shape\n- The ability to access and cary files from my \"main\" computer far more easily than is possible with iOS\n- The ability to run Termux for Linux access\n- The ability to use a mouse with my tablet at times on the go, with a *pointer*\n\nAll of those things meant that I needed an Android tablet. In the past I'd have gone with Huawei but now they're not a good bet due to all the geopolitical intrigue and software limitations. I didn't pick up the Tab A because it doesn't have a light sensor (no screen auto-brightness) or a full S6 because the price was just too high. So the S6 Lite seemed like the right bet.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Thin, light, well-built, with slim bezels\n- Far more responsive to touch than the Tab A series of tablets\n- Plenty fast enough for most uses\n- Far better screen color than the Tab A series of tablets\n- TFT (rather than AMOLED) screen tech means far less degradation over time\n- All the flexibility and power of the latest Android versions\n\nCONS:\n\n- TFT (rather than AMOLED) means that brightness and color still are uneven across the screen\n- Bad edge lighting issues (bright halo at screen edge) and poor viewing angles for the modern era\n- Brightness and color of course not as good as AMOLED\n- Default icon set and Samsung UI feels clunky (fix with alternative launcher and icon set)\n- APPS. APPS, APPS, APPS\n\nPowering up a large Android tablet again for the first time in a few years, it's obvious that Android tablet apps have gone nowhere since the last time I experienced them. There are serious problems:\n\n(1) 95% of Android apps just show a single column of full-screen-width content, just like they do on a phone. That layout is fine for a phone, or a 7\" tablet, but on a large tablet like this, it makes apps hard to use. You have all this screen real estate, but no columns. Effectively zero layout. Most iPad apps have two or three columns\u2014navigation and controls on the left edge, content in the larger right panel. iPad apps use the screen real estate in sections, like a desktop application does, because you have all that space to work with. The Android apps on tablets? They treat the tablet screen like a giant phone screen. Twitter on iPad OS? Multiple columns, nice layout. But on Android? One full-width column, like a phone, all those tweets ending up as wide one-liners and limited navigation in a single line across the bottom of the screen. Evernote on iPad OS? Three columns, one navigation/options, one for list, and one for note content. Evernote on Android? One full-width column, like a phone, making it far slower and more difficult to sort through notes. Same for Reddit. Same for just about everything. Serious usability hit.\n\n(2) Most of the *best* apps still don't exist on Android. Ulysses or Scrivener for writers? Nope. Bear for note organizing? Nope. Sente or Papers for research? Nope. Adobe creativity apps? Nope. There are very few *serious* applications on Android. Yes, you may dislike the way that iPad OS handles multi-window and mouse (I dislike it!) BUT the range and weight of the iPad OS applications means that it can stake a legitimate claim to being a laptop replacement for many people. Android? No. It's a giant-screened phone.\n\nNow, that said\u2014there are a few heavy-hitters that are well done on Android. Google Docs/Slides/Sheets and Microsoft Word/Excel/Powerpoint/office on Android are full-featured, serious apps (though the iPad OS versions still have key features and usability improvements missing from the Android versions, for example non-Page-veiw editing, rather than having to do initial drafting on distinct \"pages\" in Word). But that's about the whole list.\n\nApp for app, between the two platforms, when apps exist on both, the iPad OS version feels like the \"full\" application, and the Android version feels like the \"lite version\u2014for phones\" of the same application.\n\nAnd, beyond that, there really isn't much of an app for app comparison to be made, as there are *so many* heavy-hitter apps absolutely worth paying for on iOS, and only as many as you can count on your fingers on Android.\n\nIt's an ironic twist that while Samsung's S-Pen is great and works very well on the tablet, there's precious little you can do with it in a serious way. There are *so many* serious productivity and creativity apps on iPad OS to use with Apple Pencil (my favorite being Notability) compared to... Samsung Notes (not *nearly* as powerful) and that's basically it on Android. So they've gone to all the trouble to make great hardware\u2014but there's just not much in the way of software.\n\nIf you just need Office (either Google or Microsoft) and Netflix on your tablet, and you can't afford an iPad, then an Android tablet like this one makes sense. If you need to run Termux and also move files on and off the tablet filesystem with ease, accessing them directly, then an Android tablet like this one makes sense.\n\nBut for everyone else, it's hard to say that iPad OS isn't a far better tablet environment at this point. As a user, I seriously prefer Android vs. iPad OS by far, as least as far as the UI and user experience of the OS goes. But also as a user, there's no denying that while an iPad edges ever closer to a legitimate laptop replacement (albeit with restrictions I struggle to live with\u2014hence buying this), an Android tablet is still just a giant Android phone\u2014with mostly phone-like apps, and far fewer of them, than iPad OS with its increasingly serious productivity ecosystem.\n\nIt's a shame, because for the price, the hardware is great, the screen shape makes a lot more sense, and the openness of Android means that many more power user things are possible. But there just aren't many power user apps to go along with that ethos.\n\nSo\u2014would I recommend? If you know you need an Android tablet and are willing to put up with the compromises, yes. The hardware here is very reasonable, esp. for the price, and there's very little adware. I'll use it for the things I need it for, and for everything else, use my iPad Pro when a tablet is needed.\n\nBut for regular users? Take this money and spend it on the lowest-priced iPad, and take advantage of what the iPad OS and its ecosystem offer, which will\u2014for most users\u2014be far more appropriate.", "Haven't had it very long. I have used it a bit and realized it has all the same things installed as my samsung 5g cell device. So if you are comfortable with the phone you'll know the s6 tablet. Of course that also means it has all the unneeded things as well. I am waiting for a case for it to really begin using it though. As big as it is I feel it's may be flexible enough to cause the screen to crack. I also decided a bluetooth keyboard would be useful so I have one of those on the way as well. Again if you have a newer samsung cell device this will be simple to learn. The srceen can be a bit dim in full daylight. The included pen is great for sketching or writing in searches and the like. It has a good two inches or so of detection of the pen before it touches the screen. So it is very accurate and the company has a good history of making the pen useful. It has none nor needs batteries for the pen. And as with all things like this they charge best when turned off. I would like to be able/allowed to remove so many things that aren't necessary. But I am very privacy minded. Overall it is worth the money and with the play store it has endless possibilities. The image quality isn't as good as it could be. Of course you get what you pay for :) A higher priced one of these removes that slight issue.", " TLDR;\n- Good tablet for the money, especially if it's for college note taking.\n- Okay for content consumption.\n- Could work as a drawing tablet depending on what size your previous drawing tablet was.\n--------------------------------\n\nMy overall review:\nI bought this tablet to take notes in college and it has been an exceptional tool. Samsung notes is already a pretty good app, being able to sync across from my tablet to my phone. The screen is large enough that I feel like I can write out the entire page of notes and read it, but small enough that I don't have a floppy piece of metal that bends. The S-Pen works fine, I don't know what I'm missing with it being the battery-less version, but it is what it is. Samsung DEX has been very useful turning my tablet into a mini computer (Chromebook is more accurate) when I Bluetooth my keyboard and mouse to it. It struggles to display more than 2 windows at the same time unfortunately.\n\n-----------------------------------\nHighlights:\n\nPros:\n- The screen is relatively good looking for content watching (although 1080p)\n\n- The screen is bright enough to take notes while under studio lights\n(almost too bright at it's dimmest setting)\n\n- S-Pen drawing feels responsive and on point\n\n- It has stereo audio\n\n- 3.5mm AUX PORT (VERY USEFUL.)\n\n- Metal body (if you really care? who doesn't use a case?)\n\n- Has a rear facing camera & front facing camera\n\n- Expandable storage up to 1TB\n\n- Beyond great value for this price point.\n\n- Passed the Linus drop\n(I dropped it while opening the box onto my concrete floor like an idiot. Your mileage may vary, I don't recommend testing it.)\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nCons:\n\n- No biometrics other than face unlock.\n\n- Face unlock functionality is spotty and does not work when wearing a mask (obviously)\n\n- Speakers are not really loud enough for content watching in a loud environment (menace style in public)\n\n- Rear facing camera quality is a joke if the lighting is not perfect\n(It works, but won't even win a consolation award, let alone arrive at the finish line)\n\n- I would consider this a little too small to be a drawing tablet\n(Unless you're coming from a Huion 420 series drawing tablet)\n\n- Storage is small at 64gb", "If you are going to draw on this tablet get Ibis!\nI used to use Medibang on desktop and knew it was free. Didn't work. Wasn't gonna pay another sub fee for Clip so my sibling suggested Ibis...\nWorks like a charm. The pressure sensitivity is very minimal so don't expect to make very thin lines with a thicker brush but the tablet works great with this program.", "This review is for the Samsung Tab S6 Lite, 64gb wifi in blue. I purchased this product about 3 weeks ago and have been more than happily surprised with how well it has performed. I went in with clear expectations and they were all met or exceeded. I would highly recommend this product to anybody who's looking for a quick way to be able to take notes and also the functionality of an Android tablet. I found that handwriting recognition to be excellent. The palm rejection on mine was perfect and pen responsiveness was right on point.\n\nThe blue of the device is much much darker than in the pictures. However, the color of the blue of the pen is the same as in the pictures. I purchased a case and a screen protector for it and have been taking it to work everyday since taking notes and in my free time browsing the web, watching videos and movies in HD.", "I have a visual impairment that cannot be corrected by glasses. This worked great for making things easier to see while I was in college. If you don't need to get one of the crazier expensive options, this a great cheaper alternative.", "The stylis works great even with the protective cover. My husband is on it all day. It have a fantastic battery life. Would definitely recommend this product.", "I bought this one for work, I have the larger one as my personal one. Both work great but this one likes to randomly turn off when I'm starting to use it. I've had several Samsung tablets over the years and this is the first one I've ever had do this. I'm thinking it might have something to do with the cover I have on it but I'm not sure.

I'm not sure why. It's so nice and crisp at the focal point, but no matter what settings I use the top half is always extra blurry. I'm forced to take pictures farther away and then crop them to avoid this. Maybe with these newer phones they make the aperture so large to let in more light that the focal point of extra small.

The only things negative that I can say about the phone is that is does not have slow motion capability, and it is not great in low light. But, those things I can live without. It took awhile for me to get used to the Samsung after using the Apple Iphone for so long, but being able to add an SD card for additional room for all of the pictures I want to take is a gigantic plus for me.

Used them for my first born (who is 7 now) and using it again for my second baby. This new premium fabric catches poop stains like crazy! We forgot to put the bamboo liner and of course our LO decided to poop. We are very particular about washing it off right away and the fabric absorbed the stains almost immediately and did not wash very well. Really disappointed with the quality of this new fabric. I much prefer the older material. It was extremely durable.", "This is the first time I've tried Charlie Banana cloth diapers. I like that they are reusable, so they aren't going to sit in a landfill, like disposables, but these aren't as practical as I'd hoped. They're very bulky. That might be ok for a baby that's not moving around much, but once they start walking these are just too bulky. They do work perfectly for an overnight diaper for all sizes and ages. The bulkiness actually works in your favor overnight. They're extremely absorbent and you can use multiple inserts, so there's no leakage. They're very soft and the covers are super cute. Make sure that you have multiple diapers available each day, because these do take longer to dry than other reusable diapers that I've tried, due to the bulk. Overall, this seems to be a great quality diaper system.", "These are really cute and work well. The elastic bands are durable and prevent leaking. They are super soft and have lots of snaps to get a snug fit. The only downside is the pocket doesn\u2019t allow the insert to come out during the wash very easily which means they won\u2019t dry very well. Your best bet for sure is to take them out before washing but that doesn\u2019t always happen.", "Me gusta la tela y el materia pero encuentro que el precio puede bajar ya que son pocas cantidades de pa\u00f1ales.", "They have good absorbency I usually have one-liner in the day and two in the night since my baby is still a newborn.

I also use disposable liners from the same brand. I do have to fold them a little since they are still too big for my baby.", "Just imagine, diapers that fit newborns to toddlers, just adjust them as needed.

He does, however, have a very fluffy bottom. The prints are super cute too!\n\nThese Charlie Banana cloth diapers work differently than your standard cloth diaper brand.

I purchased the 400 Series, 72\" x 30\" desk, with a white melamine top (no fake wood for me) and gray metal legs. This is a well built product with nice finishes, definitely a modern looking desk, large in size, yet it appears light because of the open-design legs.\nIt is interesting that the pics in the Internet do not show grommet holes. I almost did not purchase the desk because of the apparent lack of grommet holes. Then when it arrived, it turned out that it had a 2\" dia. grommet hole on each side. The quality/finish of the grommet holes could be better. The bright silver finish (an attempt to match the color of the legs) does not look good; it cheapens the desk. The entire grommet, including the way it opens, could be improved. This is a $500+ desk; it simply should come with better grommets. This is the only disappointing element that I found.\nI was concerned about the trim of the desk top. It looks good and it is perfectly acceptable. It appears like it will perform well.\nAssembling the desk is a two person job, but all the holes matched and we accomplished it within an hour or so, using exclusively a Phillips screw driver.\nI give it 4.5 stars. While I am pleased it has grommet holes, I wish they were of a better quality.", "The table arrived with a small amount of cosmetic damage on the underside of the tabletop. It's a small issue, but it's something that shouldn't be present at this price.\n\nThe table itself is quite nice! It has an abundance of space. It's one of the few tables I found in this design (slab top with legs at the corners/sides) at this size. The surface finish looks lovely, and there were no cosmetic issues on the tabletop.\n\nThe legs and tabletop shipped separately. The tabletop had fairly poor packaging with cheap foam and cardboard, and it was evidently insufficient as there was a small amount of damage. See the right side of my picture.\n\nThe table was easy to assemble, and it is sturdy with little wobble. The legs are square frames that screw into the tabletop with ease. No additional drilling or modification was required.", "Despite arriving a day late, and the boxes looking like they were knocked about, everything was in good condition, with all hardware. My only existing complaint is that the screw holes in the stabilizing bar the fastens to the underside of the table top did not align with the predrilled holes in the top. There was a 5/16\" difference after lining up the first hole. I had to carefully drill 3 new holes very close to the originals.\nAll in all, the 72\"x30\" table is sturdy and feels like it could hold more than 200 lbs.

I thought since it was a new design that it'll be different but nope, same as the pampers underjams. If you have a kid on the bigger side of height and weight, I'll suggest go with Huggies. My daughter is 3 yrs old and at 3.5 ft tall and 50lbs. I used the pampers underjams until my daughter outgrew it last year when she was done potty training at 2 during the day so for night time, I used the pampers underjams and it was snug around her buttocks since the pampers are known to be snug and for babies or kids on the thin side of weight. I switched to Huggies after. The Huggies goodnites is perfect fit for my daughter with a little room for her until recently, when she outgrew it from the s/m size. I switched to this Ninjamas with size l/xl but fits like a size m/l which neither brand has and the Huggies l/xl is too big for my daughter right now.\n\nIn conclusion, nothing to rave about, it's just a more colorful version of the old underjams. Instead of cupcakes and unicorns, you got like stripes of colors. It's not even the same as the picture shown at all.

I did reach out to walker Edison to get replacement parts 3 times thinking maybe I just got a bad couple of panels and every time they said \u201csorry this part is out of stock.\u201d It\u2019s not worth the trouble.", "I bought it on sale for about $300+tax, which I recommend as the max you should pay for it. A contestant was the favorite IKEA for $250, but without the keyboard tray and looking crappy.\nSome reassembly was needed because parts could be attached to an opposite side of the project, but instructions are helpful to fix it, with some attention to details.\nThe finish is easily scratchable, and screws could break the board if tightened with even a moderate effort.\nHooks for the keyboard tray don't reach the holes for locking; some self-adjustment is required. I'd keep it open anyway, just remove the handle, so it doesn't hit knees.", "I purchased this desk for my home office after shopping around at several stores and reading the reviews online. The package came with a damaged piece, which my father and I did not realize until after the desk was 3/4 of the way put together. While I knew at the outset I was getting particle board and laminate, I still expected better quality laminate. The laminate was flaking off at the corners on several pieces straight out of the box, and at least one piece looks as if the printer jammed while the laminate was printing - it's all fuzzy and out of focus - nothing at all like the \"real wood\" it is supposed to look like. The instructions and assembly were significantly more difficult than they needed to be - in several of the steps, there was no guidance given as to which direction to place the pieces onto one another, screw/bolt holes did not align properly, etc. Even with fairly substantial experience in putting together furniture, it took two people more than 5.5 hours to put this thing together with all of the starting and redoing needed to finally get it to come together. There are also some design features that might get on some people's nerves, like the desk handle that is kinda sharp on the edges and presses against you when you move up to the desk, or the drawer that latches/locks on the inside and has to be unlocked every time if you wanted to use the keyboard drawer as an actual keyboard drawer. With that being said, the metal legs are nice, and from a distance most of the flaws are not noticeable. If you are primarily looking for something to put your laptop or computer on top of and look pretty from a distance (and are looking for a bonding period with someone else to put this thing together), then it's ok. Otherwise, you might be better off trying a different desk.", "This desk is very solid, looks great, has nice finish, and assembly is fairly simple.\n\nOne cautionary note: be careful not to put the side plates and metal legs on backwards; the instructions are not clear on the first few steps (and certain parts do not match the guide), so read through the manual to make sure that everything lines up the first time. The desk is exceptionally heavy assembled, so correcting an early mistake is difficult.", "I ordered this desk on December 21st with expected delivery date between December 30th and January 5th. The desk arrived on December 27th, and was originally schedule to arrive Christmas Eve but it getting pushed back was completely understandable.\n\nThe box itself is about 70 lbs, and very wide. Highly recommend you have another person help place it into the room you plan to build it.\n\nAssembly took me about 3 hours, but I usually take my time. I did have some slight trouble with a few parts, but a little extra work had everything working out nicely.\n\nIn terms of quality this desk completely exceeded my expectations. The desk has a slight gloss, and is smooth to the touch, and the metal frame also gives it a very nice modern touch.\n\nIn addition, I left one of the shelfs out of the assembly so I would have room to store my Pc.\n\nI'll update this review if anything else develops, but overall first impressions are highly positive, well worth the purchase!", "I was utterly shocked at how poorly designed this product is. Do not order this desk. It is so flimsy. No matter how tight you screw in the nuts and bolts, it is not sturdy. I am afraid that any little movement would cause the desk to collapse. You\u2019re better off ordering from Staples. It looks so nice online and I was so sad once it was assembled. Quality is the worst.", "This desk matched the storage units we had already purchased, which were a piece of cake to assemble. The desk assembly was tricky and we are still stuck at the drawer. For the moment we have given up and slid a table under for the keyboard, but the look is great and we're thinking of hiring a repair person to get the drawer to fit. For some reason the glides don't want to match up. It almost seems as if there is too much space between them. Considering the difficulty for us in assembling it in the first place, we won't even bother attempting to disassemble, repackage and return it.", "Overall, decent desk. Arrived quickly. I will say they need to rethink how they package these because we ended up getting a replacement due to damage and the second one was also damaged. Only a small knick here and there but for the price you pay, you don't want your desk to be damaged right away. Took maybe an hour to put together. I will say the keyboard drawer is in an awfully low spot and we kept hitting our knees on it and it hurt. BAD. So we removed it. Much better now.", "The material is super cheap- before we even had it together the top of the desk already had two noticeable marks, and it came like that in the box.", "Got this for my husband\u2019s office , very sturdy and looks nice , well worth the money", "Great desk took hours to assemble. Wood is amazing and soft to the touch. 34 inch UlraWide monitor stands greatly on top of it and there's enough room for other peripherals.\n\nOnly downfall is that the sliding rails for the drawer have arrived defected (broken). I wasnt planning on using it much, but it would have been nice to use the storage space. :(", "It takes some time, effort, and a second person to help put it together. Also, in my instructions, the two base pieces were the reverse of the diagram, and figuring out how the drawer goes is a challenge because the diagram is not detailed enough.", "Love this desk!

Too bad I don\u2019t work there anymore.", "Do not waste your money on this desk, for the price it cost I expected something a bit better.\nFirst off all the smell of chemicals is absolutely horrific, had to air the house for several hours.\nWasted 3 hours assembling it, worst instructions ever! and after fighting with the drawer for about an hour, it doesn't\neven fit.\nI would love to return it and get my money back - but how the hell am I going to take it apart and repack it, it's glued! they even provided the glue! Great way to avoid refunds!\nSO LOOK FOR A DIFFERENT CHEAP EXPENSIVE DESK, THIS ONE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND MONEY.", "I love my desk!

Seems that I have no issues or complaints until I install an update from Apple or an update from Parallels then it slows down again and I have to go and optimize and then it runs pretty fast for 3-4 days until another update! The intent of the SSD was to remove the fusion issues and just go solid SSD. If I bought a 2 TB drive, it would solve ONE problem but would not solve the needed space to give me more flexibility. I chose the 4 TB, even though it wasn't in my budget, to solve both problems at once and I am glad that I did and would recommend anyone to invest the money and move up to the extra space.\n\nThis is really interesting for those who have a Mac but don't want to open up the computer to replace the drive.\n\nI bought a USB-C enclosure and made sure the cable has USB-C on both ends. USB will work fine, but why not go with USB-C and get better performance? I placed the SSD in the enclosure and after booting up the Mac and logging in, plugged the enclosure with the 4 TB SSD into a USB-C port. I formatted it (don't format as encrypted).\n\nI have been using Acronis True Image for a couple years now, so I didn't have to buy any software. I opened the app and chose to \"Clone\" and ensure that I chose the correct drives! Triple check so you don't lose your host drive. I started the process at 1:45 p.m. and by 7:30 p..m. same day cloning 1.6 TB of data, it was done.\n\nNext, I went to the disk utility to rename the cloned drive! Obviously since it is a clone, it will clone the name as well!!!! I put SSD as part of the name so I would be able to verify that I am actually booting from it. I was able to reboot and holding down the option key able to boot into my SSD.\n\nImportant step - go to the \"About This Mac\" and verify the startup disk is the cloned one!\n\nNow that I had a faster system, I chose to do some more updates on the OS and clean up my Windows 10 VM's. At first, everything seemed a little slow. That was expected as your Mac is optimizing things, as well as the Windows VM.\n\nWhen we buy a drive with more space than we may feel we need, something good happens... we alleviate risks and remove bad habits! With Parallels for Mac, it is essential that you take snapshots and create backups. Parallels will do this automatically, but you do need to ensure that you have the room. I was able to go to the settings and now, I will be able to access a backup up to two months old, a week old, and every other day. I feel better! Of course, backup to external drive but I feel better one of the most important part of my system is now being backed up automatically.\n\nThe first few hours, I noticed a little bit of speed but not much but I knew why. Before I did the SSD upgrade, I never gave a lot of the VM's room to breathe or do the necessary updates and I had a lot of bottlenecks. I would use one VM for awhile but not another so I feel that Fusion was trying to optimize my experience but because of the size of the VM's (400gb +), it just wasn't getting it.\n\nAfter about 8 hours of updating, uninstalling apps I don't need in each of the Windows VM and just working through it, I am finally able to see some very fast appreciable and consistent speeds on both the Mac and the VM's. Could I have optimized my Mac and Windows experience beforehand and would that have helped with performance? Yes, I do admit that I could've done that and seen some improvements. In fact, my original fusion drive is still inside the Mac, so I could go back to the fusion drive and do all the optimizations!\n\nI always trust Samsung for SSD and have used them in servers before without having any issues. I am more than pleased with the performance and performing my work is so much faster now.\n\nI may choose to have the drive installed as an internal drive. I am grateful that I am able to boot to the SSD as an external drive and still see a major performance boost. It's well worth it!\n\nOverall, very pleased. The 4 TB was a bit out of my price range, but I made it happen and thankful that I did. I would love (as anyone else would be) for SSD 4TB and 8TB prices to come down 50% below what they are now. I have 24 TB of data that I would really love to convert to SSD but not at $800-$1,000 for the 8TB one. Come on Samsung! Let's do it and save the environment!", "16Tb storage (8Tb internal + 8Tb external) is the maximum the PlayStation 4 consoles support at any one time, and I'm glad I finally achieved it. I bought two of the 8Tb Samsung 870 SSDs and temporarily put them both on a PlayStation 4 Pro console, even though I already have a PlayStation 5 (itself upgraded with 4Tb Seagate FireCuda 530 with heatsink). One Samsung 870 was installed internally, the other was in an external SATA III - to - USB 3.2 enclosure. Slightly technical note: USB ports on PlayStation 4 consoles are only USB 3.0, but you can usually plug newer USB peripherals into older USB ports, and you can also choose to swap the external SSD back and forth between the PS4's USB 3.0 and the PS5's USB 3.2 for playing your PS4 games.\n\nThe Samsung 870 SSDs worked great and silently, though you won't see much speed improvements from the internal install. This is due to the console throttling speeds to maintain stability across a wide range of HDDs (and SSDs, unfortunately). Still, taking the internal drive to the maximum capacity that a PS4 can support means never worrying about upgrading the internal drive again later.\n\nI ended up switching to a regular 8Tb external HDD to put the SSD in another PS4 Pro console later, since I'd rather put up with the noise and slower speeds than spend another US$1XXX to upgrade another $400 outdated console the same way (yes, it felt ridiculously stupid the first time, so I'm not doing a second time anytime soon). But if it's anything like my past experiences with external HDDs on PS4, you'll get a much more noticeable speed boost on a PS4 external SSD compared to a PS4 internal SSD.", "I have the .5TB drive for storage, which has performed flawlessly for the last two years. I've noticed that my internal hard drive shows signs of failure so I'm cloning it with this 1Tb. Unfortunately, I should have waited a day and saved another $25. It's all good as I still need the drive which I consider a great value at the price I paid.", "Before I begin, if you're looking at getting a 4tb 2.5 inch ssd, just go with the Crucial MX500. It's consistently the best one for the money. I bought this one since it was $350 when the 4tb MX500 was $360. I regret not spending the extra $10. I'll elaborate further in the review, but to summarize, the MX500 uses TLC nand, where as the 870 QVO uses QLC nand, so write speeds in particular are much faster over sustained periods of time on the MX500 4tb than the 870 QVO.\n\nNow, to my actual review. 2.5 inch hard drives seem to cap around 2tb, so if you want something of this capacity within that form factor, you have to resort to these 4tb+ consumer drives. This one is generally the cheapest within this category, hence why I chose it. Here's what you need to know about this drive:\n\nPros:\n1.) This drive comes in a premium box, is well secured in it's place, is built in a nice metal case with a fine, black wrinkle finish. Every part of the experience of building your pc with this drive is great.\n2.) $/GB is great. Lots of storage for your money. You can thank QLC nand for that.\n3.) It's snappy enough to not feel like a bottleneck for most regular workloads. You can 4k video edit off of it, you can download games at the peak of most internet connections, and you can transfer normal sized files, like 20gb or smaller, in 35-40 seconds or less. Not even enough time to get up to pee.\n4.) There's an SLC cache of around 70-75gb that keeps the ssd feeling very snappy for workloads within that 0-70gb size. You get the usual speed of 550mbps reads and 300-500mbps writes depending on file size within this workload. This is necessary for QLC drives to feel snappy, as QLC nand flash is far slower than TLC, MLC, or SLC nand flash, so this large SLC cache is awesome to have. This also brings me to what I dislike about this drive\n\nCons:\n1.) It's a QLC drive. These are the slowest SSDs available on the market. Thankfully, this one isn't slow for most use cases, but once that aforementioned 70gb SLC cache fills up, the drive gets slow. REALLY slow. You write at the speed of hard drives, or even slower. 60MBps-100MBps is what I see during these workloads.\n2.) Although it's cheap for a 4tb ssd, for an extra $10 on the regular, you can get the Crucial MX500. That's a TLC drive that mops the floor with this drive for write intensive workloads. For most people, they wouldn't notice the difference, but for me, the extra speed after that 70-75gb mark means the difference between getting to download a large game like COD Warzone in one night and game with my friends vs waiting for the next day to game with them.\n3.) At this price point, you have the option of NVME drives. If you need speed, go with those. 2tb gen 4 ssds are commonly available at this price, and although it's half the capacity, they're more than 10 times as fast for sequential workloads. I'd recommend the XPG Gammix s70 blade, since it's $230 at the time of writing this, and competes with drives that cost $300-$350.", "This works perfectly on the ps4 my launch ps4 runs this with no issues, the only difference on this ssd vs a hdd is the ssd is a tad bit smaller and when u screw this into the drive bracket for the ps4 it will feel like it doesn't line up but it will, I went from a 2tb hdd with a chunk of my game library on the drive to a 4tb ssd and my full ps4 gsme collection and then some with well over a full tb to spare, loading times are faster on the drive so u will get to ur games a bit faster,", "Works great and the quality is obvious.

Super fast too.", "I was immediately suspicious of the box when I saw it.\n\nIt looked like the security tape had been lifted and then reapplied as can be seen in the photo I included with this review.\n\nThis was an item sold and shipped by Amazon.\n\nI went online to watch unboxing videos of the same product so that I might be able to spot signs of a fake product when I opened it.\n\nI called Amazon and verified that I could return the product for a refund even if opened and then took an unboxing video of it while on the phone with an Amazon rep.\n\nI couldn't tell from looking at the drive or the rest of the packaging that anything was wrong with it.\n\nI told the Amazon rep that I would check with Samsung the next next day to see if they could verify if it as an authentic Samsung serial number and as a new product.\n\nI expressed my concern that even if it was a Samsung product that it might be used and I would never have any way of knowing. Or even if I could tell it was used after I installed it I would then be in the position of having to uninstall the drive in order to return it.\n\nThe Amazon rep told me that if anything was wrong with the product that Amazon would issue a refund without requiring me to return it if it was already installed in my computer.\n\nSamsung verified the serial number the next day as being authentic and said that I could even tell if it had been used before as well by using their magician software program.\n\nI thought the only way I would be able to detect if it was used was if there was old data on it left by someone else but Samsung said their software could detect if the drive had been written on before.\n\nThe catch is that that software can only be used to diagnose a drive after it has been installed internally to a direct SATA connection. Their software couldn't diagnose the drive through an HDMI connection to an external dock unfortunately.\n\nBased on it having an authentic Samsung serial number, the assurance by Samsung that their software could detect both fake and used products and the assurance by the Amazon rep that I could receive a return-less refund if needed I went ahead and had the drive installed.\n\nI figured the worst case scenario would be that it was a fake and/or non functional drive and I would have to take it out again immediately, the best case scenario was that it was a new and working Samsung drive and the in between scenario would be an authentic but used Samsung drive.\n\nIt turned out to be a used drive. It had been wiped and reformatted but it had been written to before.\n\nI called Amazon back and told them the drive was verified as used and I expected a refund. At first the rep refused any refund and then said I would only receive a refund if I uninstalled the drive and sent it back.\n\nI told them that was fine with me if they were willing to pay for both the installation and the uninstallation fees charged by a computer repair shop.\n\nThe Amazon rep of course refused either option so I directed him to get a suprivisor on the call and then played the recording of the conversation I had with the Amazon rep the day before....I got my refund immediately.\n\nThe big lesson here is to record the unboxing of any expensive items you buy, especially if the packaging looks tampered with or damaged.\n\nAnother lesson is to record your phone calls with Amazon reps or with any customer service person if you are calling up with an issue.\n\nI learned a few things about this product and Amazon throughout this process.\n\nThese QVO Samsung drives store four bits of info per solid state cell. Most consumer SSD drives store only three and some expensive special purpose ones store just one.\n\nThese drives have a shorter life spans than three bits per cell drives and handle having large amounts of data written to them at slower speeds than three bits per cell drives. They should be cheaper as a result but often aren't.\n\nAmazon has no way of tracking where a product comes from even if it was sold and shipped by them.\n\nAmazon just puts all the Samsung 1TB 870 QVO drives into a bin regardless of whether or not Amazon bought them from Samsung directly themselves or they were supplied to Amazon by a third party seller.\n\nUnless its an Amazon branded product that no one sells on Amazon but Amazon (Amazon basics, 365 Foods, etc) they have no way of knowing where it originally came from even if it is \u201csold and shipped by Amazon\u201d.\n\nBuyer beware.", "Install was seamless and there was an instant difference in speed compared to my old internal HDD.

Levi\u2019s 711\u2019s were the very first Levi\u2019s I ever purchased. I have about 25 different pairs of Levi\u2019s and also lots of shorts now in all different cuts including premiums and some that are 100% cotton. This is what I have learned: not every Levi fit is created equal, 711\u2019s may fit you completely different than wedgies or mile highs or 501\u2019s.You may wear a 28 in one style and a 32 in another. For instance I wear a 28 in mile high, 29 in 711\u2019s and a 30-32 in some of the 501 and premium wedgies. Do not be surprised if one pair of Levi\u2019s fits different than others of the same size. The material and cut can make drastic differences in how they fit your body. Generally if the jeans have a high Lycra/elastane content then you are safe to get your normal size or even size down. 3% elastane means stretchy. Levi\u2019s has something called \u201chyperstretch\u201d which is a special fabric blend to make jeans super snug and super stretchy. It\u2019s a blend of cotton, Lycra, elastane, polyester and lyocell. Mile highs are almost all hyper stetch. If you buy a pair of Levi\u2019s that are 100% cotton expect that you may need to size up and remember that they will stretch out a size or two naturally with wear. The very high cotton content jeans may seem ridiculous tight at first but they will mold to your body maybe even become baggy. Can even put them on a little damp to speed this process up. Also-THE \u201cR\u201d tag is done purposely. Levi\u2019s has to show that they own the copyright to the red tag itself. As in just that little red tag. It is unique to Levi\u2019s and about every 10-20 pairs they will purposely put an \u201cR\u201d tag to show this. So don\u2019t think they are fake just because you got one of the R pairs. You got a rare pair. They real. Also it does not matter whether the name Levi\u2019s is capitalized or lowercase- It can be either or, I order directly from the Levi\u2019s website all the time and it can be either. Also, only \u201cpremium\u201d Levi\u2019s have a leather back patch on the waistband and a quality tag sewn inside, if you buy regular Levi\u2019s they have a cardboard type back patch, no quality tag-they are different. Don\u2019t automatically think u got a fake pair. People just don\u2019t realize this, so they jump to \u201cOMG must be fake\u201d, I did the same once upon a time but now I have enough Levi\u2019s to know. Do your research. 711\u2019s tend to run big in the waist for me, they are very flattering to the hips, I would say they are mid rise. 711\u2019s look great on anyone\u2019s booty, very universally flattering fit but may gap a bit if ur lil in the middle with a big booty.

They hit just above my ankle. The long length hits right at my instep, the length I prefer my jeans to be.\n\nThese jeans are mid weight. They're not super thin but definitely not heavyweight. They fit true to size on the waist and there is stretch so, if I gain a few pounds, they will still fit. The legs are very skinny. My legs are thin and these really hug them. The stretch though would allow those with larger legs to wear these as well.\n\nThe light blue denim feels tighter on my legs than the darker denim. No idea why especially because usually, the darker the denim is, the tighter they are in my experience. Both pairs hold up fine to all day wear. They don't bag out or stretch in the waist.

If you tip the razor just a smidge it'll cut!!! It happens bf you even realize it! I am super happy with the results though and I'm very glad I bought these.", "This is perfect for dermaplaning. The razor is sharp, easy to glide and use.", "Mostly for derma planing on my face. I really love it. It makes it easy to use. I would recommend this to anyone.", "Be very careful when using these razors. They aren\u2019t like the cheap ones at Walmart. These are actual blades. It\u2019s east to use if you follow my directions. Watch a lot of videos on face shaving/barber videos and make sure you know how to work with a blade before trying to use it.\n\nA tip for using them is be very light handed with them bc they take off even the thin white peach fuzz without any effort.\n\nMake sure the blade is always flat against your skin or it will get slit open if it\u2019s facing even slightly up. You will have to work around your face shape. Do not ever shave where there is acne bc it will bleed and get cut off. Never shave with oil or anything slippery bc if it slips your face is done for. Do not use any pressure when shaving just move the blade against your skin as if it where wind.\n\nJust shave with lightly damp face (not wet) and then moisturize right after shaving. I do not recommend this for sensitive skin unless you are willing to sit there for along time carefully shaving your face like if it where an antique piece of art.\n\nYou saw those other reviews didn\u2019t you; don't make those mistakes bb.

I got these jeans on sale so I thought \u201clet\u2019s just give them a try\u201d since they are not 100% cotton they should have some stretch.\n\nI am 5\u20196\u201d 145 lbs and I have a longer torso and an athletic build. The size 27 fits a bit tight when buttoning them up when you first put them on, but I know with this fabric will loosen up and be the best fit. I am normally a 28 in a high rise Levi Jean if it is over 90% cotton. I am VERY happy with this purchase! The light wash is SUPER cute too!", "Only complaint is the came with a weird smell. I had to air them out for two days and spray quite a bit to get the smell out but super cute and fit super well", "I ordered a size 27, I am 5\u20192 and around 125 pounds and these might be the best fitting jeans I\u2019ve ever bought! They obviously don\u2019t show any ankle, but that is what I wanted, I can wear them just like regular jeans without having to get the length altered! These are super flattering. I ordered another pair right away.", "Love the overall fit of these, the wash is lighter than expected but still very nice.", "These jeans fit perfectly and have a tiny bit of stretch. Getting used to the button fly since it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve had jeans like this. Nice neutral color.", "This is the perfect high waisted jean. It has a bit of stretch which makes them very comfortable. I usually wear a size 30, but exchanged for a 31 since the waistline is high. Fits nicely. Iv\u2019e ordered 2 pairs.", "I\u2019m 5\u20193 and these jeans are perfect for the just above ankle length.

Usually jeans aren\u2019t high enough on me!", "These are great, but they are not the same quality as Levi's branded jeans from an actual Levi's store. The denim on these is thinner and they don't seem to hold their shape as firmly throughout the day. However, the fit and wash are still very cute.", "They are just a little bit in the waist area for me. I ordered a 26 I believe but could\u2019ve done with a 25", "i\u2019m usually a 25 in jeans and they were way too big! these fit loose on the back. i\u2019d recommend getting a size down.", "I wasn\u2019t expecting these to have stretch but they are very stretchy. I think they will good for work from home but they wouldn\u2019t look good with a shirt tucked in. Otherwise they fit me well.", "These jeans are super high-waisted and flattering! I would size down one size, because they are 85% Cotten (not 99% as the description states) so they are a bit stretchy.", "Been wanting to try out the Ribcage style jeans for awhile now and saw these on sale. They\u2019re great! They ran a little large at the waist, so size down for your perfect fit. The stretch is comfortable and doesn\u2019t dig in anywhere", "These are so comfy and cute. Order your normal size- these have a good amount of stretch!", "I am athletic build thick legs and have medium skin tone so light color jeans never look good on me, but these are magical! They contour my curves so well and the cut is super cute. I normally wear a size 9-10 and they are true to size.", "155 size 8 very true to size and amazing stretch 100% yes on these", "I love almost everything about these jeans. The are a flattening high waist, ankle length, and true to size. I didn\u2019t realize that they are a button fly, but that\u2019s fine. For me they are just a bit too stretchy. I didn\u2019t realize they were going to have so much stretch, and after a couple wears they\u2019re too big and start to fall down below my waist. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll have to wash and dry them every time I wear them which is a negative. I\u2019m 5\u20198\u201d 150ish lbs and the 29 fit great. I say ignore the measurements size chart and go with the American size equivalent instead. I\u2019d give them 4.5 if I could because they\u2019re becoming my go to jeans and overall really like them", "I\u2019m 5\u20197 and these fit perfectly at the ankle. Very cute. They hug your waist and are loose in all the right places.", " So, I recently lost about 30 lbs and I wasn\u2019t quite sure what size I should order. It seemed like this made better sense than ordering a random 10 or 8 online since they can be so different from brand to brand. I measured my waist and ordered a 29w but after receiving these and trying them on, I think I should have gone with a 28 since there is a bit of a gap at the back.\nThey were not big enough for me to return and exchange and they are very comfortable. Easy to move in and a great slightly cropped length, even on my short legs.\n\nThey are flattering and the material feels pretty good. Also, I\u2019m pretty cheap. I purchased these jeans when they were on sale for $34.00. But if I had spent the 60some dollars that they were originally marked as I would have sent them back and probably not as an exchange."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C2LHG2R", "title": "Hanover Foosball Soccer Game with Stainless Steel Rods and Counterbalanced Players, 57\" Wx29 Dx34 H, HGFB01-BLK, Black", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/8186r9ZC-aL._AC_SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "1 rating", "description": "Keep your family entertained for hours with the Hanover foosball table.

Revitalift Derm Intensives Night Serum with 0.3% Pure Retinol is our most potent and has our highest concentration of Pure Retinol. So effective, in a clinical study, 100% of women showed reduction in wrinkles, even deep ones. This serum is free of fragrance, silicone and parabens and was validated by an external panel of dermatologists. WHAT IS PURE RETINOL? Pure Retinol is a top dermatologist recommended anti-aging ingredient proven to fight key signs of aging such as wrinkles, even deep ones. With many retinols available in skincare, look for those that say PURE. WHY CHOOSE PURE RETINOL? Pure retinol\u2014considered to be the most potent form of retinol is known to be more effective than retinol derivatives, but it degrades over time. This patent-pending night serum was specially formulated to remain very stable. What does this mean? It is potent and effective from the first drop to the last - giving you powerful anti-aging results with continued use. SEE VISIBLE RESULTS. After day 1, skin feels moisturized and texture feels more refined. Overtime, wrinkles and deep wrinkles are visibly reduced, skin is smoother, and complexion is brighter. This serum is allergy tested, absorbs quickly, and does not clog pores. STARTING A PURE RETINOL ROUTINE. This product contains high potency retinol which may cause initial redness, tingling or dryness which is normal even if you've used Retinol before. Your skin may need time to get used to this powerful serum, so it\u2019s important to introduce it gradually. Use a couple of times a week at first and slowly move to nightly use. Read product carton before use. SPF LOTION REMINDER. When using retinol products, always use an SPF Lotion in the morning, such as Revitalift Triple Power SPF 30 Lotion. Results based on a 12-week clinical study of women aged 35-75 when used as directed. An external panel of dermatologists validated that Revitalift Derm Intensives serums uphold strict formulation standards and reviewed independent clinical testing results and protocols.", "reviews": ["Let's face it none of us wants to accept wrinkles or any other effects of aging. I am 75 years old, and fortunately inherited good genes from my mother, so I don't have a lot of wrinkles. I have noticed than my cheek \"apples\" have fallen and gravity is doing a job on the skin on my neck, not to mention other parts of my body.\n\nPrior to buying this retinol cr\u00e8me, I did some research to find out if it would help or would be another waste of time and money. What I found out is that retinoids can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles by increasing the production of collagen. They also stimulate the production of new blood vessels in the skin, which improves skin color. Additional benefits include fading age spots and softening rough patches of skin. However, it takes three to six months of regular use before improvements in wrinkles are apparent\u2014and the best results take six to 12 months.\n\nRetinoids and retinols change how a cell functions, specifically the speed at which a cell turns over, or divides, to create new cells. Retinoids encourage skin cells to divide more rapidly, building up the protective top layer of skin, the epidermis. As we age, there is a decline in the natural production of collagen and elastic fibers that give your skin lift and bounce in the epidermis. That makes our skin more frail and thin, which leads to wrinkles, sun spots and other types of visible skin damage.\n\nRetinoids help mitigate those issues in a variety of ways. They thicken the epidermis through increased cell proliferation at the top level. They increase the production of natural chemicals (such as hyaluronic acid) in your skin that keep it plump and moist. They stimulate collagen production and inhibit the breakdown of collagen that already exists. They also block several inflammatory pathways that exacerbate pimples and acne.\n\nThere are definitely side effects with both retinols and retinoids, but they're temporary, lasting around three to four weeks. The most common side effects are redness, dry and scaly skin and itching or burning. Wear a sunscreen during the day because retinoids increase the skin's sensitivity to sunlight. These drugs must be used continually to maintain their benefits. So, if retinol works for you, the benefits can be maintained only with continual use.\n\nPersonally, I can't honestly say this product did anything for me. I don't have sensitive skin so I had no side effects. This product says there is .3% of retinol which is a very small percentage. This seems to be an acceptable and effective percentage of retinol. I haven't used this product for 12 months, but so far, it hasn't done anything for me. I suppose that waiting for 12 months for something to work means more to me than if I was 50 years old.\n\nI hope this review was helpful for you.", "This item is helpful for puffy eye and sinus area particularly during allergy season. (Wrinkles are not specifically an issue to determine whether or not the serum is effective in this capacity.)", "This moisturizer is wonderful along with the serum. I can see/feel the difference between higher end products and this product. I will use L\u2019Oreal from here on out\u2026I\u2019m 70 years old, and I\u2019m finally happy for my facial products!", "This is an amazing product, I have used it for about a year and have almost no wrinkles", "This product is very easy to apply and has almost no scent.

Very pleased I entered it into my skincare routine.", "I tried it based on the reviews and not only does it feel great going on, I can actually notice a difference in my skin. It\u2019s moisturizing without being sticky and leaves skin soft and supple.

It\u2019s a great value and definitely my favorite.", "Not only is this a superior form of retinol, but it's a pretty strong potency for the price. I have been using retinol for about 20 years, but I gradually increased my potency as I've gotten older. If you are a newbie to retinol, PLEASE follow the direction. 1 to 2 drops twice a week. Really, if you are a newbie or have sensitive skin, the practical thing to do with any new product that is going to go on your face, is do a patch test first, right at your inner elbow area. Wait 24 hrs. If you have a reaction, this is not the product for you at this time. Try a lower strength of retinol, but make sure you distinguish what form of retinol it is, because each one has diffetent potencies. For those with sensitive skin, you may be better off trying Grandoid retinoids, which is much gentler to skin than retinol. I have used some retinols that I swear didnt contain retinol, so its best to read up on what the best retinol product is for you. Revitalift is highly praised by many retinol enthusiasts, which is what made me buy. I just purchased my 2nd bottle because I just absolutely love it. It feels nice on the skin, plus it absorbs really quickly into the skin. I follow up with a very hydrating night cream because it is essential to do 2 things when using retinol, 1.Moisturize afterward 2.Wear SPF Daily if outdoors. And PLEASE do follow the directions, as others have said. Its ridiculous to post pictures of your red face warning people not to buy this product. Did you start out with 1-2 drops twice a week, followed up with a rich moisterizer? Are you wearing SPF daily? Did you read that this is a moderately strong retinol that takes getting used to? That burning and redness means the product is working!!! Don't blame Loreal for your lack of common sense. They explain this product perfectly. The directions that come with the serum arent just there for show, folks. This is one of the best drug store retinol serums on the market. Please, people, use it with care, educate yourself. Don't spoil it for other people.", "Love this product", "Very good to use.", "It makes my skin feel good and I feel like it works.", "It is strong. I have sensitive skin and had to go lightly at first and did not use nightly. Do not use around eyes as skin is thinner there and it will burn. Deep lines and wrinkles will diminish.", "Prior to Loreal retinol night serum, I was using Olay and Roc retinol, both have strong a strong smell, so strong its hard to sleep! Recently I've been getting migraines that certain smells trigger, so it's a No for Olay and especially Roc products.\nI tried Loreal retinol and hyaluronic acid and no smell, hallelujah!! Plus I really feel very strongly that they are both helping my skin and the wrinkles are less pronounced! My face also looks more refreshed in the morning! Love this product!", "Everything you read tells you that you HAVE to give retinol products TIME, TIME, TIME. They are not kidding, friends. They talk about how so many people give up before seeing results because the purge/retinization stage is so awful. I was almost right along with them but I kept googling suggestions and hoping for the best. I think what finally helped me turn the corner was realizing how much my skin could tolerate - and it was much less than I was applying. I had redness, peeling, pain, itching, continuous breakouts....ugly, ugly, ugly and no fun (depressing actually). The last thing you want is to add MORE problems when you already have oily, acne-prone skin. What finally seemed to work for me was when I started using a smaller amount and mixing it with my nightly moisturizer. Such a difference that made. Also I live in FL and have been enjoying the beautiful sunny days so when I have had more sun exposure I skip applying the retinol that evening. Speaking of which, you must remember to use an SPF during the day because the retinol makes you more sensitive to the sun. Now....can I say my skin looks better than before I started the retinol process? Yes. Can I honesty say that I see dramatic results as far as lines/wrinkles etc..? Not so sure. Maybe if I didn't see myself everyday I might notice a subtle change...? Suppose before/after pics might have helped? Maybe the test will be when I finally get to see my family after more than a year of quarantine.

The second week I used for two nights a week directly on ny face with 2-3 drops. The third week i was able to apply about a teaspoon and cover my whole face and did not have any reaction . I think the key is to start slow. I have seen great improvement with my complexion. I have acne scarring and some head lines so I will update in a few weeks.

I\u2019m a bit concerned that nowhere else can you seem to find bottles with 40 gummies (if I\u2019m wrong please tell me!) and these are 1/2 to 1/3 the cost of everywhere else...it makes me think that perhaps they are fake but literally everything else on the label is exactly the same.\nAs for taste, we purchased blueberry flavor. It\u2019s fine. It has a bit of a weird side taste and the gummies are a little gritty, but they only take a moment to chew so it\u2019s fine. We\u2019re starting with one a day to get our bodies used to these and will move to two a day after a couple of weeks.

I found this chair in an online ad. The lady was selling it for $100 brand new. It took about an hour to set up because some of the holes weren't exactly lined up. Fortunately, they were close enough for me to get the screws all the way in and tightened down. Other than that there were no problems. It came with the correct screws and an Allen Wrench. While the height only adjusts by a few inches, I find that it is at the perfect ergonomic height for me, eyes only a couple of inches below the top of the monitor. I'm 5', 9\". The armrests raise up a couple of inches as well, so my arms can lay right across the desk. If you sit straight up right, the ergonomically correct sitting position you also get excellent lumbar/lower back support. My last chair was semi-comfy, no arm rests and the back went to just below my shoulders. I wasn't going to complain, not for a chair that was $20, nearly new. The headrest is also comfortable. In all it is a great chair, with very minimal drawbacks.\nPros; comfortable, stylish, head rest, adjustable arm rests, cost less\nCons; only adjusts a few inches, holes didn't quite line up", "My teenage son started having online school due to the pandemic for almost half year. He complained the normal office chair he had was not comfortable to sit for hours.\nWe were super lucky to receive this Respawn gaming chair at this special time when everyone is studying and working from home in our family.\nThe chair was easy to assemble. The instructions were easy to read. It took less 20 minutes for hubby to set it up.\nThe chair is built well with full metal frame. The integrated headrest and lumbar support are comfily filled with durable foam.\nThe best part is that the chair can auto-adjusts to your weight, simply push back to tilt your chair. It adds strength on the back of the chair, locking into various recline positions with the back angle lock.\nThe height of the armrests fits perfectly under my son\u2019s desk. And the wheels is not slippery on carpet so my son won\u2019t get distracted by the chair while studying.\nOverall this is a super nice chair! Though my son is not using it for gaming, it does provide nice back support for hours.

I also have the Wedgie Skinny in a size 12/31 and it's comfortable and only digging in at the butt area and I still have crotch room. Also the length of these are short, they are above my ankle.

Sometimes they get broken by amazon rough handling but I\u2019ve bought straight from the company and never had a problem.", "I received a pack of three refill cartons of Cleancult All Purpose Natural Cleaner in the Bamboo Lily scent. I\u2019ve bought Cleancult laundry tabs (sadly discontinued) and hand soap that came with glass refillable containers, but these are refills so you\u2019ll need a sprayer. I had a new plastic spray bottle on hand that works fine. My refill cartons arrived in tact with no leaks.\n\nI\u2019ve used this cleaner on a variety of surfaces, such as the kitchen counter, stovetop and sink, the bathroom counter, toilet exterior, glass mirrors, resin (not wood) furniture and so on. The bamboo lily scent is a floral that smells pleasant but I find it moderately strong. It\u2019s described as an essential oil blend, so I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s all natural. Either way, natural scents can still trigger allergies, though I\u2019m sensitive and haven\u2019t had any issues.\n\nThe cleaner seems concentrated and I find it effective even cleaning greasy surfaces. I simply spray and wipe without using much elbow grease and surfaces look and feel clean. I do notice an oily residue on some surfaces and have no idea if it\u2019s safe to leave, so I tend to rinse my kitchen counters where I\u2019m handling food but don\u2019t rinse other surfaces, such as the stovetop, toilet tank lid, etc. It\u2019s a personal decision whether to rinse.\n\nI don\u2019t find this cleaner ideal for mirrors due to the oily residue. This works well cleaning any surface junk off the mirrors if that\u2019s the primary goal, but mine don\u2019t look clear and instead look hazy after wiping due to the oily residue. This cleaner is effective and has a natural emphasis (which I assume makes it less harsh than many mainstream cleaners but doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s risk free). But it leaves an oily residue, and the scent is pleasant but fairly strong. Like it. 4 stars.\n\nIngredients (from company site): Bamboo Flower Essential Oil Blend, Saponified Coconut Oil, Saponified Olive Oil, Propanediol, Citric Acid, Sodium Gluconate, Limonene, Potassium Soap, Sodium Citrate, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate.", "I purchased this product direct from the cleancult website.\n\nI found this use for the all purpose cleaner: crusty roasting pan.\n\nI have been fighting the battle of the nasty roasting pan for quite a few years. Pastes made from baking soda, oven cleaner, and just about any solution recommended by YouTubers. Scrubbing forever trying to get that brown and black stuff off. Most of the time I thought I should just buy a new pan.\n\nI was getting ready to try and scrub the gunk off the pan, and sprayed it heavily with the undiluted orange zest all purpose spray. I went off, and kind of forgot about it until a couple of hours later. Most of the stuff came off with a wet cloth. The rest came off with a few minutes easy scrubbing with steel wool. About 2 or 3 minutes total! It looks almost new.\n\nIt is a little too concentrated for ordinary cleaning, so I would recommend diluting it by about 50%; but undiluted it eats through grease and gunk better than anything I have ever tried.\n\nThis was a game changer for me.", "I absolutely love and try to support companies that care about the effect their products might have on our planet and its inhabitants, and Cleancult is one of those. This is my first experience with this brand, but it's been a good one so far. I received three cartons of their all-purpose cleaner in the Bamboo Lily scent. It's a sweet, fresh scent that I could smell before I opened the box. That's because all three of the cartons inside had some damage from leaking. There was only a little bit of actual product spilled outside of the cartons, fortunately, but a much bigger mess could easily have happened. Still, I appreciate Cleancult's attempt to minimize packaging, and I love that these cartons are recyclable!\n\nAs a cleaner, this stuff works really well. I actually think it might be concentrated a bit more than it needs to be, as it left a film on my hands and was sometimes hard to rinse away. I will add a bit of water to it and mix it up in my spray bottle in the future. It did clean my countertops and stovetop just fine, even cutting through the grease and oils on the stove. And I love the fresh scent. I usually use a vinegar mixture for wiping down the countertops every day, and let me tell you...this smells MUCH better! But it's still plant-based and biodegradable, not to mention vegan and 100% cruelty-free!\n\nConsidering how far a single carton of this stuff can stretch, and that this is a bundle of three cartons, I think the current price of about thirty bucks is more than fair. It's a really good eco-friendly product that leaves surfaces clean and fresh-smelling, and I do recommend it.\n\nI hope my experience with this product might help YOU make a more informed purchase. Happy shopping!", "The solution I tried was the bamboo lily scent. It\u2019s very unique because the cleaner actually comes in a carton like milk. Clever really. Also better for the environment than the plastic. It\u2019s a cardboard box with a plastic twist cap. I am always up for trying new cleaners especially non-toxic and safe ones to use around our children and pets.\n\nThis solution is already mixed and does not need to be watered down. It also does not need to be rinsed after it has been used. The solution is very clean smelling. It does smell green like a plant or bamboo but it has a sweet after scent of a flower. The solution is liquidy and not thick. It\u2019s easy to pour into a spray bottle because of the carton construction . It leaves a little bit of an oily residue on the surface. It almost reminds me of a wood cleaner in that way. It\u2019s not sticky though. Besides the oily factor I do like the smell of the material. It\u2019s not so oily that it can\u2019t be used but the oiliness is noticeable to me. It\u2019s not a completely clean surface. Because of this I can\u2019t use this cleaner on every surface.", "I have 2 kids, and anyone that has at least one of these creatures knows that kids can be pretty gross. Throw in the germaphobia that comes with a pandemic, and it feels like we can't keep stuff clean enough. I work in the environmental field, and I recognize how harmful many of the \"typical\" cleaners can be. However, as a mom I recognize that many of the green products don't always cut the mustard - or the grease. Regardless, I'm always anxious to try a new option that can bring my 2 concerns together.\nThis stuff smells great! So many cleaners make you feel like you need Level B Hazmat PPE to use, but this could not be farther apart from that. The bamboo lily has a light and very fresh scent. Usually I rely on the citrus family for that, but this is a nice departure. I used this to scrub out my kitchen sink and bathroom counters. It knocked away surface grime and left the rooms all smelling great. It does take a bit of rinsing, but that may be a function of us having soft water down here.\nFor everyday, \"soft\" cleaning, this is perfect stuff. The skeptic in me will still want the strong, nasty stuff for epic germ events, such as the aftermath of a stomach virus. But I like this. I really do.\n\nP.S. My son saw the milk-shaped carton and the coconut on the side, and wanted to drink it. You might want to hide this in your kid-free cabinet.", "I bought a couple of the pop-up towels that you add you own cleaning solution in the plastic can. This is the perfect match to those. It's not the cheapest solution overall so it gets a one-star deduct in my humble opion. That said it is good in it's cleaning properties and leaves little residue if not soaked to the extreme in the pop-up cannister. Overall a solid 4-star refiller for those pop-ups requiring your own juice.", "This cleaner smells fresh and light. I much prefer my countertops to smell like this instead of a strong disinfectant, and this works as well. When I first tried it out, I didn't have an empty spray bottle handy, so I poured a little out on the counter and used a damp cloth to wipe the counter. The way the carton is designed, it is very easy to just pour straight from it onto the surface I want to clean. It cleaned nicely, but, like most natural cleaners, did not take off the coffee stains which can be stubborn. Otherwise, it cleaned everything else and left my countertops looking fresh and clean. And, actually, a little bit went a long way, which I was very pleased with!\n\nI love that I can use this cleaner on any surface and not worry about streaks or residue being left behind. I have used some harsher chemicals on tough bathroom or kitchen counter stains, which is necessary to remove them, but then I go over them with this natural cleaner to remove the residue. The 3 cartons came packaged nicely with a thin cardboard divider between each one to protect them from spillage or dents. Overall, I really love this cleaner and highly recommend it."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GFDW7VK", "title": "Mary's Gone Crackers Real Thin Crackers, Chipotle, 5 Ounce (Pack of 1), Made With Real Organic Whole Ingredients, Gluten Free", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/61L3Gm72IdL._SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "2,764 ratings", "description": "Chia seeds \u2014 ancient strength for modern times did you know that chia means \u201cstrength\u201d in Mayan?

Did the inner screen, the whole reason that the phone cost $1400, randomly get a crack in the seam that has been steadily growing despite the rest of the phone being kept in immaculate shape? Yes it did. I have treated this thing like a newborn for the half year that I've had and it even still the screen is basically self destructing. The body of the phone is rock solid and the hinge feels like new to this day but the inner screen spontaneously growing cracks drops everything but the battery life down to a 1 star.

MINE BROKE WITH IN THE FIRST 60 days WITH VERY LITTLE USE and CAN NOT RETURN IT.", "I got it brand new but it's already registered by someone else through samsung, so I paid for a phone that is not mine", "I have had this phone for over three months. Here is my opinion.\n\nThis is the best phoe I have had. I have not regretted the decision to buy this phone for a second.\n\nI have been a fan of the larger phones for years. I have gone throught the Note 7-10 phones and felt the large screen and form was perfect. I have always like using the S pen for editing as finger touch on a phone screen is not always perfect.\n\nI was worried that I might miss the S pen factor and the benefits of the Note series phones from Samsung. Plus, a folding phone was a new form and the earlier Samsung fold has some hinge issues.\n\nFirst, the fold factor is flawless. There is a clear and distinct opening and closing hinge. There is no doubt when the screen is fully closed or opened. And, the hinge is sturdy. No concerns about over stressing the joint.\n\nWhen closed, the front screen is more than adequate for answering or taking a quick look at messages/emails. It also is great for a quick look at a news feed.\n\nThe folded size is a benefit in putting it in a narrow cell phone pocket or pants pocket. I find the folded ocnfiguraiton much easier to handle when carrying the phone or making a call.\n\nAfter looking at the front screen, opening the phone gives a near tablet size experience. The phone will allow you to read an app on the smaller front screen, and when opened, show the same information in a full expanded view. It does allow rotation and the screen fills with whatever is being viewed.\n\nMovies like Netflix allow a wide screen format or a fully expanded view.\n\nWhen sending messages, folding the phone to 90 degrees allows a large keyboard on the bottom hald and the messages or email on the top half. That's great for reviewing and sending information.\n\nRegarding the screens...\nThe front screen has a protector that is different than the inside screen. I did remove the protector as it is exposed to daily use and does show some wear. There are multiple screen protectors on the market. It is an easy replacement.\n\nThe inner screen has a softer and more rubbery feel. It doesn't bother me. I do need to clean it or wipe it off when it looks smudged. I have not had to replace it and it has stood up to three months of daily use. Being hidden inside the phone except when used keeps it from excessive wear. I do note that many people have replaced the inner protector without issues.\n\nCharging the battery gives me more than enough for daily moderate use. I have never had less than 20% at the end of the day. And, I keep my screen bright. I do not have background apps running all the time.\n\nMy only gripe is that the phone are the case protectores. The phone when folded is thick. It is not so thick as to be a problem in a pocket or coat. However, all of the cases are thick and add more bulk than I want.\n\nMy current solution is to only use a back case protector. The front and sides are uncovered. This has resulted in a small cosmetic ding on the hinge. But, even with an occaional drop, the found has worked without a problem.\n\nI can enthusiastically say that if you are considering this phone, you will not regret the purchase. The new form is fantastic. When folded, easy to answer and scan information. When opened, a tablet like experience.\n\nThe best Samsung ever.", "This is a great phone and I've had no issues that all these Apple fan boys are having. Yes if you notice, most of the negative reviews are from iphone users. Seems to me like these people already had a negative outlook on any Android device.

No Fanboy here. I've had the Fold 2 since launch with no issues. It's a solid device and not as fragile as so many non-owners make it out to be.", "First off, I have owned many, many phones over the past several year and I must say I love this phone. The technology alone with the folding screen is incredible. It is like having a really good phone and a tablet together. It is thicker than a regular phone while closed but manageable .

The connectivity is so poor that I cannot be more than three or four feet away from it. Absolutely unacceptable for a phone in this price range. Finger Print Reader - Finger print reader only works about one out of ten attempts. It's both easier and faster to type in a security code.\nDelamination - The laminated screen protector on the inside, large screen is continuously trying to delaminate.

I switched to samsung from iphone some 10 years ago because I loved the phablet experience from the early Notes (Note3 as a matter of fact). I actually don't like the new notes compared to the old ones. The feel in your hand and the size with a stylus were amazing. I digress.... this is about the Z fold 2. I just couldn't pass up the pull to buy the latest gadget. Unfortunately, it's just not \"there\" yet. I think it needs to be double the size of the note20 when you open it. So in my mind it is still not big enough. The front screen is still too small to really use..... the inside screen is just simply Meh.....and the abilty to effectively use the wider screen really isn't \"there yet\" (programs/apps lagging). When I say the inside screen is Meh, I mean that it has a horrible \"feel\" to it and even with me being excessively protective and careful with it, it already has a small ding in it. From what I have no idea as i baby this thing. And I am not a young kid that abuses their devices (I'm 50 and take excellent care of this thing). I am going on 6 months of owning this phone and I still do not think the price is justified. I won't be a sucker an buy the next iteration that comes out. Not for this price.", "I bought mine through Verizon but I wanted to share what a great phone this is. Battery life is incredible. I can go all day with a single charge.

My hair feels super soft, it's shiny and frizzy split ends are softer and less noticeable. This is after ONE wash y'all. I can't wait to see what it does after 6 months of use, combined with the other changes I'm making for healthier hair. Once I've used it more, I'll leave another updated review about how long the shampoo/conditioner has lasted and how it's helped my hair.

Getting the old fluorescent panel out was a huge pain. Floor joists above made it nearly impossible to pry out of the ceiling but it came out eventually.

It actually fits well enough that I\u2019ve used a couple on him now. I think a size 2 would be a better fit, especially if he poops in it since it will likely come up the back. But judging from this they do run maybe even a whole size bigger than Huggies and Pampers. So I will sadly give this box to a friend who has a newborn.\nIt\u2019s too bad though because these diapers are incredibly soft. From the outer layer to the liner it\u2019s silky smooth.

They are definitely high end diapers!\nThe price reflects this however, and it\u2019s hard to justify paying a higher price for them. Compared to other \u201cnatural\u201d diapers like Honest though, they win hands down.\nThe one feature that would really make them the *perfect* diaper and worth paying more is a pocket in the back of the waistband like little snugglers has to prevent poop blowouts.

The diapers are a little thin around the legs, but it's not a big deal if your baby is a back sleeper: the main part of the diaper is very absorbent.

I can't speak as much for absorbancy since we're using them on a kid who hardly needs a diaper. They are very thin however so I'm a little skeptical. Indicator lines are hard to see as well.\n\nSide note, the elastic around the legs is weak and there are large wings a long the elastic", "I want to start off by saying my daughter has extremely sensitive skin. She has had issues with diapers since birth and even has trouble with ones that are listed as hypoallergenic. I am always on the look out for diapers that will work for her but these definitely aren\u2019t them. First they definitely left a rash on her when she wore them over night. So right off the bat I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to leave here in them for more than a few hours. Second they are the most horribly shaped diapers I have ever had to deal with. Most diapers are what I would consider tapered to fit. Meaning that they basically took a long rectangle and then tapered the leg holes and then cut it down a little in the front to fit right under their little bellies. These are literally giant rectangles. No tapering at all. They fit horribly. Now I will also say that my little one is very skinny. She is only in the 8th percentile for weight. So know that the diapers tend not to fit her as well in general. However these basically were just a giant set of straight lines. Additionally I felt like they were incredibly thin and didn\u2019t absorb almost anything before they leaked.\nOverall I wouldn\u2019t recommend these diapers.", "So, they DO work.

They look like they run big, but they do fit true to size. It's like there's extra fabric on the sides that wrap around her belly?\nNo rashes on her sensitive skin, though!\nOverall, they do work great and are good on her skin, but I'll stick with my normal diapers due to price.", "These are huge. Much bigger than the same size in Huggies Little Snugglers. My 21 month old swims in them and I think they would even fit my 3 and 5 year olds if I had them on them. They are bigger than size 4T-5T diapers! But the quality seems nice. My son has sensitive skin and doesn't seem to have a reaction to these. He had two bowel movements and these didn't cause any kind of leakage or blow out. But I'll probably shelf these and wait until he's a bit bigger.", "These are absorbent and really really soft. They run big though so beware when buying them.", "These diapers do the job! They are slightly bigger than Pampers baby dry size 3.

I\u2019ve had that happen as well though with Pampers where they were thick then next pack in box was thinner.\nMy son is 3 months and he used one overnight and into the morning - had went #1&2 and didn\u2019t leak nor did he have any rash or redness. I purposely didn\u2019t use any baby powder to see if he would get red as well. He\u2019s nearing probably 13lbs and 23.5\u201d long wearing these in size 1. Cute unisex pattern with the cat and random shamrocks. Would love to see these in different patterns.", "These diapers are extremely soft on the inside and the outside. The inside of the diaper has a pattern and some texture. There is good elastic on either side which helps to prevent leaking. Those sides also come up high and it really traps both liquid and solids. There is also plenty of stretch in the back of the diaper. The diapers have the soft attachment Velcro. There is nothing rough or irritating to the skin. It immediately attaches to the front of the diaper as it should and stays in place until it needs to be removed. The print of the diaper is white with shamrocks and kittens. There is a wet line indicator which is down the front end and back to help the parent out. Of course, usually it\u2019s pretty obvious whether or not there is a diaper change to be needed. The diapers have no scent and they are very clean and soft. I am pleased with the stretch and hold that these diapers provide.", "Eco friendly is the first thing i noticed with these diapers. The second thing I noticed is how soft these are. Not stiff like some of the others I've purchased before.\nAbsorbency is nice. I do like that these have a wetness indicator on them.\nEven though it throws people off by these running a little larger than marked on the box. For me, they worked out great. The little one is in between two sizes. So by having these a little larger, they fit perfect.\nHave only been using these for a few days now. No skin irritation at all. They hold up nice. And like I stated, great absorbing.\nGlad I took the chance and purchased these.", "We typically use pamper swaddlers and they have worked great for us so far. Comparing these diapers to the swaddlers the sizes are a lot different. Swaddler size 3 is a 16 \u2013 23lbs. These woodswell size 3 are 20-33lbs. So, they are still a little big for our little one than I expected. The overall quality of the diaper seems on par with pamper swaddlers. Pampers has a slight fragrant to their diapers and these woodswells do not have any scent. I appreciate them having no sent because the possibility of the scent irritating my baby\u2019s bottom. I really like the stretchy straps on these woodswells diaper. They really form to your particular baby\u2019s bottom. The only downfall I have with these diapers are that they are a little pricy."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08L4452WC", "title": "PUL Biodegradable Dental Floss Picks | Made from Plants, Eco Friendly, Vegan | Non-GMO, Fluoride Free, BPA Free | Charcoal Infused | Minty Fresh | Shred Free | Dental Flossers for Teeth (200 Count)", "price": "$8.95", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/51GEreUH0jL._AC_SX569_PIbundle-4,TopRight,0,0_SH20_.jpg", "ratings": "448 ratings", "description": "PUL Biodegradable Dental Floss Picks | Made from Plants, Eco Friendly, Vegan | Non-GMO, Fluoride Free, BPA Free | Charcoal Infused | Minty Fresh | Shred Free | Dental Flossers for Teeth (200 Count)", "reviews": ["Great concept but truly a luxury.

They say here this is an antiperspirant and deodorant. The actual product says deodorant only. I\u2019m going with the actual product as Degree does have deodorant only products in their product lines and I\u2019ve learned to watch closely for this. If you are wanting a product to control sweating, this might not be the choice for you. Degree does have other products that do cover both areas.\n\nThe second point is that this is an aluminum free product.\n\nThis is definitely a masculine scent. It doesn\u2019t smell how I expected, because coconut nor mint jump out at me, but it doesn\u2019t smell nice. I\u2019m not sure how I would describe it. The scent is a bit stronger than you get with a product for women, but it isn\u2019t overwhelming. This stick is what I call \u201cgel\u201d sticks as opposed to the white sticks. It is on the cool side when you put it on. It goes on smoothly without residue.\n\nI could not find an expiration date anywhere on this deodorant, although there is a lot number. It is made in the US.", "This stuff works well, and has a more uplifting and natural scent than my normal deodorant stick. The scent is quite nice (and, to me, mostly unnoticeable a few minutes after applying it.) And, of course, it keeps you dry and perfuming the air with your special mix of body odors. I'm not sure why it's bragging about 48-hour protection: quite frankly, that sounds like some kind of specialty product to me. If I'm going to be doing something for 48 hours and need to stay dry and not smelly...well, I generally take showers in between, and probably only need this stuff to work for 6-9 hours a day. That said, I cannot vouch for the full 48 hour protection, but for a normal work/school+after school day, it does the job well.", "The stick version is a deodorant not an antiperspirant so this product does not address wetness, just odor. This formula includes no aluminum and the stick is not dry and opaque but instead translucent with a moist texture. The 2.6 ounce deodorant states on its label the product provides 48 hours of odor protection. So far the in-house adult male is pleased although he has not tested the 48 hour claim.\n\nI do not detect any coconut mint fragrance, instead it is a spicy complex scent that I\u2019ve noticed in other personal care products designed for men. The scent is not unpleasant but it is strong so this product will definitely compete with any other scents being worn. So, if possessing a sensitivity to fragrances this may be an issue. Only quibble is that the coconut mint scent isn\u2019t more natural instead of cologne-like.", "DEGREE Men Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick Coconut & Mint 48-Hour Protection, 4 count, 2.6 Ounce\n\nAluminum Free Formula in Coconut & Mint\n\nMy husband doesn't like to use deodorant with aluminum in it. The downside of the aluminum free deodorant is that it just doesn't stop sweat and odor like a traditional deodorant. Having said that, this DEGREE Coconut & Mint is probably the best aluminum free deodorant that he has tried. The Coconut & Mint smells really good. It worked pretty good as deodorant. It isn't an antiperspirant so it doesn't control sweat like an antiperspirant does which is why aluminum free deodorants don't work as traditional antiperspirant/deodorant.\n\n\u26f5\u2693Seas the Day\u2693\u26f5", "I wanted to mention that this is not an antiperspirant because I feel like sometimes people don't notice or pay attention.

Honestly, I was skeptical since I've tried a number of \"natural\" or \"Aluminum-Free\" deodorants in the past and while they always seem to start out fine, after a week they just can't fight off the stink and I always go back to something that will work long term.\n\nThe scent is great. Refreshing, light, and not overpowering.\n\nThe price of less than $5 a stick is reasonable for the product.\n\nOverall very happy with the \"DEGREE Men Antiperspirant Deodorant Stick Coconut & Mint 48-Hour Protection, 4 count, 2.6 Ounce\".", "I am slightly annoyed that this is called antiperspirant, since Id on't think it has anything to actually stop you from sweating -- it appears to be more of a deodorant.

It's definitely OK, but really, JUST ok. In my first experiments, I had to run it in the same roof four times in a row to get the floors similar to when a Swiffer mop is used by hand. It often doesn't seem to put out enough water and the brush seems too soft, and it just can't really agitate a dirty floor well enough to do a really good job in a single pass.\n\nIt's navigation is also pretty bad. It struggles with an even slightly complicated floor plan and clearly has no idea where it's already been and where it still needs to go, and the results actually show that. After a single pass in a room with furniture, you can clearly see with the naked eye a sort of 'patchiness' on the floors. It also really, really matters where you start this thing. In one room of my home it did a surprisingly thorough job when started in one area, and then a really awful job when started in a different area.\n\nMuch of this robot is designed quite well though. The build quality feels pretty decent for the price. The dual tank system seems to work pretty well. It holds a lot of clean water, and it's satisfying to see it collect so much dirty water in the other tank. It offers a kind of peace of mind that at least some of the dirt really is coming off the floors. In fact, my first initial reaction watching it work was that this thing was going to be junk and I'd be sending it back. But, after tinkering and playing with it, the dirty water reservoir has caused me to rethink that.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether we're going to keep this thing. We're going to try it out for a couple of weeks. Ultimately, a machine like this is only as good as it is convenient to use, and this thing may have just enough annoying issues and room-prep requirements to hardly ever end up being put to use. And, realizing that it's cleaning prowess is likely based on how frequently it's used (it's just not doing all that good a job in any one pass), if it gets in its own way of getting used, it's useless.\n\nHere's the thing though--what this device is, perhaps above all else, is a really frustrating proof of concept. A more competent or experienced company could resolve all of these issues in spades. I've used each and every one of the iRobot mops and all of them are worthless in all but the most limited cases, but they're vacuum cleaners are tanks that seem to last forever. Neato, another premium cleaning robot brand, has the best navigation I have ever seen. It cleans more methodically than I do.\n\nIt seems clear to me that this product in either of these company's hands would be a total game changer. And honestly, the *main* issue with this item is its shoddy navigation. If it were laser guided and methodical like the Neato, or had the years of algorithmic research like the Roomba, if it could avoid wires and shoes and navigate efficiently around furniture, could reliably figure out where it has and hasn't been yet, it might be an excellent machine who's benefits far outweighed it's faults. But it's not. Its faults are glaring and really seem to overshadow its virtues.\n\nAs it is, it really just OK, maybe a little less than just OK. I'll update the review again after we decide if we're keeping it or sending it back.\n\nUPDATE: we sent it back. Ultimately the decision was made because it couldn\u2019t clean our bathroom tile floor, which is not a complicated or even unusual tile design or style. The gaps between tiles, which are less than a centimeter wide and maybe a few millimeters deep, we\u2019re too big for the machine. It also couldn\u2019t decide what to do with floor vents and always got stuck, and would just spin it\u2019s wheels on the wet tile. The rest of the review stands. If you have very flat floors, and extremely simple floor plans, it might be okay. But it\u2019s probably not going to work for you.", "I have two Bullmastiffs. Living with Bullmastiffs means that clean floors for longer than a night of sleeping is literally a dream because you will never see clean floors when awake. I needed a break between the heavy duty scrubbing of my tile floors to try and keep them cleaner. So I decided to dive into the robotic mopping market and after a lot of research, I decided to try the iLife Shinebot. After a few days, here are my experiences:\n\nI have two types of tile floors. My kitchen tile is smooth, slippery (unfortunately) tile and my dining room tile is a rough stone surface.\n\nTo be fair, I did not scrub my tile floors before trying the Shinebot. I allowed my floors to relish in the dried up drool and muddy paw prints for several days while I waited for this machine. I did vacuum up the fur and dried dirt beforehand.\n\nIn the kitchen, the first pass of the Shinebot did not clean up the dried up drool, but it did do well to clean up the paw prints. But paw prints do not carry that extra special stickiness that is inherit to top quality dog drool. On the second run of the Shinebot, I pre-treated the drool stains with a spray cleaner directly on the floor (not inside the Shinebot dispenser), and the Shinebot was able to clean up the caked up drool better with the help of the spray cleaner breaking down the stickiness. It took a third run to get the floor \"clean\".\n\nSome other observations on slick tile include:\nThe Shinebot was too tall to get under/cover the toe kick area of my cabinets. So any grim within that recess would have to be cleaned with my Hoover FloorMate. The Shinebot also did not clean a about an inch and a half away from where the tile meets my carpet. So that will also need to be covered by my manual push machine.\n\nThe battery life is great. I was able to run the Shinebot for at least 4 cleanings on one charge. The water cleanup is pretty good, the floors dried fairly quickly. It seems to use very little water while cleaning. There was barely a quarter cup of water in the dirty water tank after each cleaning. And the water was black if you want an idea of how much ick was sucked up. The remote control is easy to use. And the robot is very easy to clean after each clean cycle. And the coverage in the open area is excellent.\n\nFor my dining room tile which is not as slick and textured:\nThe Shinebot did not seem to clean as well through the textures and there was almost no dirty water sucked up into the dirty water chamber. It did not clean the grout at all on either tile floor. I will have to do that using my manual push cleaner. I believe for my dining room, the Shinebot will be great for \"dusting\" the floors versus scrubbing the floors.\n\nI think this robot will work great on sealed wood floors without caked on grime, but I don't have that type of floor to test on. Overall, if you are looking for a robotic cleaner that will clean your \"not so dirty and caked on\" slick tile floors in-between manual deep cleaning, this robot will do fine. I did a deep clean with my manual push cleaner and have been using this Shinebot to clean several times a day (after the dogs eat, after we come in from walking the dogs, and when we go to bed). And for that purpose, I get to \"see\" clean floors during my awake time. It's glorious! And for that, I give 3 stars. Meanwhile, I hope they can come up with a stronger robotic scrubber that has the muscle to handle pools of dried Bullmastiff drool, with a lower height profile in order to reach under the toe kick of the cabinets, and a better border reach to get right at the seam where the carpet meets the tile.", "This is a very good product that cleans the hard floor very well. It has the mapping function and smart routing. I really like it. However to get the best value of it you need to know its weak point and avoid breaking it. As pointed out by lots of reviews it\u2019s weak point or design flaw is its handle. The handle hinge is weak and made of plastic. The cleaner when filled with water is quite heavy maybe seven pounds. If you lift up the cleaner by the handle as expected the handle will break off after couple of months maybe 100 load cycles. So to avoid breaking the handle you need to lift it up by using two hands grabbing its two bid wheel wells just like you are grabbing a sea turtle. This way you can enjoy using it for a long service life.", " Best mopping robot on the market by far. If you have a ton of hard flooring, this will be a lifesaver. (I have 1,720 sqft of mostly LVP and tile in my bathrooms/laundry). I love it so much that I now own two of them.\n\nFor techies, the app itself is a bit rudimentary, but will allow you to do zone specific cleanings, specify how much water you want to use, how fast to turn the scrubbing brush, etc. And the basic functionality of just letting it do it's own thing works great, with it easily navigating around chair legs, etc.\n\nPros:\n- The ability to control unit travel speed, amount of water used, speed of the cleaning roller, and number of cleaning passes means that you can actually get a deep clean on your floor.\n- You can also do just a drying pass to make sure your floors are extra dry (great for hardwoods)\n- The separate clean/dirty water tanks are PRICELESS, and the W450 is the only mopping robot that comes close to my beloved Hoover Floormate (which is exhausting to use).\n- The battery life was great, and the navigation was better than I expected.\n- The microfiber roller has scrubbing strips which traverse the entire width of the roller as it cleans. A fast roller speed + slow unit travel speed = more scrubbing action.\n- The clean water tank is relatively easy to fill, and the dirty water tank is easy to empty. Just drain the dirty water, add some clean and shake around to dislodge any debris picked up, and drain again. They do include a cleaning brush, but I don't see why you would even need it if you immediately clean the unit after using, and vacuum beforehand.\n- They generously include a 2nd cleaning roller, and replacements are only $13 for 3. A bottle of cleaner is also included, and is the ONLY cleaner that should be used in the W450. Replacements are $5/bottle. But you don't have to use detergent every time, nor do you have to use the full recommended 6mills.\n- The cleaner is AMAZING. My floors did not initially look as clean as I was expecting, and I quickly figured out that it was removing YEARS of film from my prior cleaning product. It took about 3 passes to remove it all, but my floors now look FABULOUS. FYI that it does have a fresh scent, but it does not bother my overly sensitive nose.\n- It has a remote, but I have never used it.\n\nThings to be aware of:\n- No notification if the brush is not installed. The end result is water being sprayed on your floor, which I actually found to be a great pre-clean soak for high traffic areas!\n- No notification when clean water is getting low - it sounds like a machine gun when air enters the water pump\n- No mapping of your room (nor saved map) - a zone clean is basically your best guesstimate of area size with the rectangle that you draw\n- Slight high pitched whine on occasion for those that are noise sensitive, but not to the degree that really bothered me.\n- The owner's manual does call out that the unit will not be able to do it's best work on tile with deep grout lines, which makes sense.\n\nNOTE: my video uses 100% water, 10% travel speed, and 100% brush roll speed\n\nIf you are thinking about buying, DO IT. Your back and your floors will thank you!", "I'll start by saying I have ideal floors for this unit. They're LVT and very smooth, no grout to go over, no rugs, nothing in the way. I gave the Shinebot the best chance of succeeding and it failed miserably. Twice!\n\nI don't know if the reviews are fake or if they are just sending out a bunch of defective units, but this purchase was a total flop x 2. To be clear I ordered one and it didn't do what it was advertised to do. So I returned it and bought a second one, thinking the first one was just a fluk, and the second one was exactly the same, didn't work.\n\nI'm not an idiot...I thoroughly vacuumed the floor right before use, I made sure it was fully charged, I read every page of the instruction manual, and I set it up exactly how it should be. This robot IS an idiot though. I used 2 different ones, so actually they're BOTH idiots and they both experienced the exact same failures. I'm sure if I got a 3rd unit it would be just as useless as the other 2.\n\nPro: It does deposit the clean water on to the floor...\n\nPro: Thank god I bought on Amazon and can return for a full refund\n\nCon: It does not suck up the dirty water from the floor. When I went to empty the dirty water tank, it was bone dry, like not even one single drop of water had been sucked up. It just leaves all the dirty water all over the floor. Again, 2 robots tried, both robots had zero water in the dirty tank.\n\nCon: It doesn't use all the clean water you give it. I had it running for about an hour. The first half it deposited a lot of water on the floor. And by the last 30 minutes it stopped depositing water and was just rolling across the floor in random directions doing nothing. I assumed it ran out of clean water. But no, the clean water tank was about 70% full, it just decided to stop using the water for some reason. Again, BOTH units did the same thing.\n\nCon: It doesn't follow the pre-programmed path it's supposed to follow. It cleans the same place 3 or 4 times and then shoots across the room and cleans one other random part, then goes another random direction, goes 2 feet then changes direction again, another 5 feet, then spins around in a few circles, another few feet then it decides to skirt the edge of the room for a few minutes, then randomly changes directions a million more times. It doesn't all follow the path it says it will in the instructions or in this listing. It's totally random. 60% of my kitchen floor is currently covered in streaky dirty water and the other 40% is bits and pieces of floor that was completely missed by the erratic robot. BOTH robots failed at following the path it's supposed to be programmed to do.\n\nCon: It leaves streaks all over the floor, so I legitimately have to manually mop my floor now that this thing has made a complete mess. BOTH robots left streaks.\n\nCon: The remote only works to start it and stop it. If I try to change the cleaning mode on the remote it doesn't respond. If I try to use the arrows to get it to go a certain direction it doesn't respond. Of the two units I had, one robot did respond to one of the remote cleaning mode buttons and ignored the rest, the other robot didn't respond to any of remote buttons.\n\nCon: The first time I ran it, it only drove about 10 feet forward and then stopped and said it was finished. Like I said I bought two, BOTH of them on the first go around cleaned for 10 feet and then turned off and said it was done. What?\n\nCon: The error messages don't make sense. It drove over to a floor vent and got stuck on the lip, then it stopped and said to clean the drop sensors. I checked and the sensors are spotless. So I move it away from the vent and start it up again. Naturally it immediately changes direction and heads straight to the same floor vent where it gets stuck and tells me again to clean the sensors. The sensors are clean, it's only been out of the box for 2 minutes! Apparently if it gets stuck on the lip of something that translates to dirty sensors.\n\nCon: It can't sense stairs. If it goes near a downward staircase it'll just drive right off the edge. So I just kinda stood there for an hour fighting it off whenever it came near\n\nThis was a huge waste of time and now I have to clean up after it. Thanks for giving me more work to do than when I started! Negative a million stars for you, ShineBot, you give cleaning robots a bad name!", "Great little guy as long as you keep it clean, and make sure there is water in the clean water container. It doesn't tell you if it's empty and you'll clean your floor with a dirty brush. Great for slightly dirty floors. Remember it's not a top of the line cleaner with all of the bells and whistles.", " I actually love this little thing I\u2019ve named Roberta the Robomop. I honestly did not expect very much considering the sort of microfiber mop roller with no cleaning bristles or anything. But I got it more for getting up the dusty residue left after vacuuming. This DOES NOT VACUUM so that has to be done prior. It came with a remote control but I\u2019m quite sure I\u2019ll never use it since you have to tend to it prior to just mopping such as loading it with water and cleaner. I have 3 large dogs and in less than a week I could create a whole new dog from the hair they all endlessly shed. So I have also ordered an ILife Robovac. I tested Roberta yesterday in the kitchen which gets the worst (or rather shows the worst) of the dirt. I\u2019ve always pre-treated any visible spots with a spray floor cleaner before I use my Bissell Crosswave and so I did with this. We sat mesmerized for at least 20 min watching Roberta figure things out. This is a huge kitchen, probably at least 250 square ft. Roberta cleaned the whole thing with battery to spare. She would sometimes stop, seemingly thinking about what to do next and sometimes so long I thought something was wrong. But she would then forge on. The pathways do not always make sense to me but I guess they make sense to her because she cleaned the whole thing. A couple times she would stop and plead \u201cClean the nosewheel\u201d. But her nosewheel was clean. So I just turned it and hit clean and she continued. The ceramic tile throughout my home is 12x12 with a 1/4\u201d grout line. This little Robomop did just fine. She did not suck up the same amount of water as the Bissell but it\u2019s only water and it will dry and it looked great when done. It will not clean your grout lines. It will not scrub your tile and make it look like you spent all afternoon on your hands and knees. But it does exactly what I hoped. We left and when we got back, the house smelled so good! I\u2019ve uploaded a video of Roberta in the bathroom. This is the only slick tile I have so I tested her due to complaints of the wheels spinning in place on slick tiles. You can see her stopped for a short time and sometimes she will sort of rock back and forth slightly but she is not spinning her wheels. I guess she\u2019s mapping or thinking or whatever Robomops do. Sometimes she will stop so long you may think something is wrong. Just leave her alone. She will notify you if something is wrong with voice prompts. If the wheels are spinning then maybe you added too much floor cleaner to the water. At any rate, she\u2019s exactly what I needed. She\u2019s much quieter than I expected. Another thing I love is that she sensed my bed\u2019s dust ruffle and did not go under the bed where I had not vacuumed. If I want her to go under I\u2019ll have to tuck up the dust ruffle. One thing I don\u2019t understand is many times she will roll up to a barrier and stop just before hitting it, sensing it\u2019s presence. Other times, she will very slightly bump an object. Either way, she performs way better than I expected from the reviews. Guess it\u2019s all about your expectations.", "There are many things to like and dislike about the w450.\n\nIt is by far the best at cleaning what it can clean (unless you go Narwal). But there are limitations.\n\nIn open areas it very does well. It will pick up most all worn in floor dirt and stains. When the W450 gets closer to walls or toe-kick - it does not do well at all. It stays anywhere from an inch to two inches off the wall (and if you add in the underside of a toe kick...that its too tall to get under then you have a considerable amount of manual cleaning to do after the W450 is done with the open floor area).\n\nIt has trouble with chairs and table legs. I have a tall kitchen table with four chairs and while the W450 will go beneath two of the chairs it will not go underneath two others. All chairs are the same, the area was well lit under all four and the chair legs are one and a half times the width of the W450...so plenty of room. Ran the unit three separate times to be sure it was not a 'one of' issue.\n\nThe hardware: No issues with build quality. I really wish iLife had elected to use LIDAR instead of a camera. I suspect that may have resolved going underneath my kitchen table (as my Roborock has no issues doing that ...and it uses LIDAR.). Maybe the next iLife generation.\n\nThe software: is blah. Love that it shows you a map of what it cleans. Horrible it does not save it. While it allows for zone cleaning...its the worst implementation of zone cleaning I've experienced. It opens a 'square' for you to position and resize BUT THERE IS NO MAP on the screen for you to orientate the zone. You have to guess on the layout of the last map it displayed. Pretty much useless. Also does not have 'no go' zones. Most likely because it does not store a map.\n\nLast point on the software. The app uses 'sliders' to adjust water flow, roller speed, unit speed instead of something that allows you to enter your preferred number. Because of this it takes more effort than it should to 'dial in' the percentages you want to use. (Think fat fingers and little slider). Please fix that iLife.\nLastly and this is a big issue. I set my waterflow to 2% in the app. Phone screen turns off after 10 minutes. I open my screen only to find the app has changed my water flow to 80%. I lower it again and the iLife does adjust, but when my phone (Samsung S10+ ) display turns off and I turn it back on...it has reset the flow back to 80%. This needs to be fixed in a firmware update asap.\n\nSo while it does a great job cleaning where it cleans there are simply too many negatives to keep using it. I really wanted this to work and save me work, but it isn't a time saver given what it does not do. The software needs a lot of tweaking to make it user friendly and useful. The hardware would probably benefit from a LIDAR design and if possible make it fit under kitchen toe kicks.\n\nIf you purchase this just know you'll still have plenty of mopping/cleaning to do after it finishes mopping.", "I been using this Shinebot W450 for about six moths, and I like it. I vacuum and mop the floor daily so the floor is not super dirty. I tried many mopping robot and this one is the best I've tried. The AI or the floor map is good but not perfect, it knows the starting point and will return to the starting point when the job is finished. I have problem with the design of the dirty water tank, it is very difficult to clean or dry the dirty water tank completely. Overtime, I started to get error message \"Please check Dirty Water Tank.\"\nAt some point, the Shinebot would stop working even when the dirty water tank is completely empty and completely clean. To solve this problem, I fill the dirty water tank (also the fan-coil outlet and suction passage) with 10% bleach + water solution and let it sit for about 30 minutes and shake it vigorously to dislodge any sediment build up. Then drain the beach solution from dirty water tank . Fill the dirty water tank, fan coil outlet and suction passage with boiling hot water tank, cap it, and let the hot water sit for about three minutes. After three minutes, press the fan coil outlet and suction passage blue valves a few times then drain the hot water from the dirty water tank.\n\nIts been five weeks since that deep cleaning and my Shinebot W450 is working perfectly again. Perhaps either beach solution or boiling hot water is enough to do the trick. Haven't have the opportunity to fine tune the deep cleaning method.", "I've had 7 robot cleaners, 3 have been mopping bots. The best was the 2nd to the last Irobot Scooba which vacuumed and mopped. The last Scooba was horrible, not sure why they changed the design. Then they switched to what everybody else is doing - the horribly designed \"pad-robot\" which just pushes a dirty pad around; Irobot's is the Braava. I'm not sure why all of the other companies think it is a good idea to have a pad on the bottom of a bot that will just spread and smear around whatever is on your floor. So this Ilife bot is the only mop I found on the market that actually sucks the dirty water back up for you to dispose of. And this one does a fairly good job of it, especially for the price. It would be nice to see more suction power on it, but as long as I do a thorough job of cleaning it each time, it does a pretty good job. I've never used the remote so did not review that part. Getting the tank back on before starting it is a bit tricky, but you figure it out after a few times.", "Play Video\n So I was looking on Amazon for a great robot mop as the Shark robot vacuum I have works great and thought getting a robot mop would be even better! I was searching for sometime for something without pads to replace and this is the only one that does not require changing a pad for it to clean and the reviews seem very promising so I ordered it. Couple days later it came and I was super excited... I let it charge for a few hours and then filled it up and hit GO...... at first it was doing pretty good it was actually going around the walls without hitting them.... but then the wheels got wet and because of this it started to not work as well as I had hoped. At this point as I am writing this it is currently stuck on some grout and just spinning away but not able to move.... I have attached a video just to show what I am talking about..... so after about an hour I decided this is not going to work well for my floors and went back to a regular old mop and bucket.\n\nWhat really bothers me about this is there are two very tiny wheels on the front and back of the machine and they easily get stuck in small cracks (or in my case grout) on the ground.... I am not sure who's bright idea it was to use super tiny wheels but hey... I am not an engineer.. maybe there is a method to the madness.... Also the main tires on the side of the machine are not really designed for gripping so even when it was not stuck on grout it tends to slide on the the tile it is on lol.... honestly I am very sad this did not work as I had hoped but from what I can see from other reviews this is suppose to be the cream of the crop kinda robot mop.... so be warned if you have larger grout lines in your tile.... this is not the machine for you.... if you have hardwood or lament this thing will probably be amazing but a last I can not confirm this since I don't have this type of floor.\n\nThe reason I gave this 4 stars is mainly because it really is not the robots fault that it can't get over the grout lines when it's wet this was just designed poorly and hopefully for the next gen they have some better tires like on the shark vacuum that literally blows through the grout lines with no issues..\n\nAgain if you have deep grout lines..... don't even do it I am saving you some time and disappointment.", "I have found this mob very quirky. Below are some of the quirks and my review of things I don't like.\n\n1. It requires a clean swept floor. Things like grass strands or toothpicks clog the vacuum vents and the thing stops putting out water. Clean the vent plugs and it start working again.\n2. The app is really quirky in that it won\u2019t work if the unit is on the charger and is not very explanatory. I could find no discussion anywhere the sliders for speed, water, etc. are explained.\n3. I can find no rhyme or reason to it mopping. If I put it in the same place, it will run defiantly.\n4. I wish it had the ability to block out areas. I end up putting up barriers to get it to run where I want it to.\n5. The zone cleaning has no way to tell how big the zone is you have selected you have to just guess.\n6. The voice statements such as start cleaning are intelligible.\n7. The rubber stoppers for the tanks are a concern because you use the quite often. I believe the will wear out and I don't think they are replaceable\n8. The wheels appear not to be replaceable either. I have had an iRobot mop (actually more of a Swiffer than a mop) and the wheels got grimy and had to be replaced. I suspect this mop will have that same issue in the future.\n9. It takes a long time to charge. From dead stick to full charge is over 4 hours.\n10. I have yet for it to tell me when the dirty water tank is full. Basically, when it stops putting out water then I know the tank is full.\n11. The entire system seems slightly poor in design.\n\nGiven these issues is it worth 350 bucks. I would say iffy.\nWill I return it, Maybe. I will probably keep it because it is easier to work with these quirks than lug around a mop and bucket and it does pull up a LOT of dirt from my floors.\nIm gonna give it a few days playing with it... Well... I decided to keep it. After the learning curve I have found that it works amazingly well. i updated it to 4 stars. The only problem i have right now is i cant find any replacement brushes. Everyplace is out of stock. I think they may be on a boat off the coast of california.....", "The cheap linoleum in the kitchen of our apartment was feeling \u2026 sticky \u2026 in the summer humidity. (Indeed, I wonder if the previous tenants cleaned it that often.) So we bought this mopping robot, hoping that with daily use, it would mitigate the problem. And it has. Quite well.\n\nI like that this model is not just a wet Swifter being dragged across the floor. It has a roller and it does spray a good amount of water + cleaning solution on the floor. (Sometimes a tad too much.)\n\nI can tell that it\u2019s picking up lots of dirt and grime. The water in the dirty water tank was just FILTHY the first several weeks we used it. Now months later, with near-daily use, the floors are no longer sticky, and the water in the dirty water tank is less and less filthy. And I dare say \u2026 we can now detect a shine on the linoleum in the sunlight.\n\nWe also use this in our bathrooms. It\u2019s the same linoleum as in our kitchen, but it was smelling like mold. (There are no windows in either bathroom to ventilate moisture and the ventilator fan is a joke.) The Shinebot has cut down on the mold smell.\n\nI like the supplied cleaning solution. It has a light, pleasant smell to it. Not perfumey.\n\nOne nuisance is the number of times the robot stops and announces \u201cPlease clean nose wheel!\u201d There is never an actual problem with the nose wheel; it just seems to stop. It happens once or twice a day. We just restart the thing.\n\nThis thing is also good with spills. We knocked over the tank of a carpet shampooer in the bathroom. It wasn\u2019t a ton of water, but it was filthy. So we put this Shinebot on it with repeated cycles, and it cleaned up the mess. Quite well.\n\nOverall, this is a handy robot. I\u2019m glad we bought it. No more feet sticking to the linoleum while I\u2019m cooking.", "The shinebot works, but how well it works will depend on your floor type and expectations. It is new technology and has all the hiccups that new technology has. However, I love this robot even with all the kinks.\n\nFor me, cleaning the floors is difficult. I have 4 cats and a dog, and a very bad back. I am not physically able to vacuum and mop manually. As my floors can get quite messy, I didn't want the standard robot mop that uses a damp towel to wipe the floor (I can do that myself) I wanted something that had scrubbing action. This robot does that. It does a great job of scrubbing the floor.\n\nIf you have dark floors or dark tiles/grout this robot may not work well for you. It uses a light/dark sensor to find the dirt, so if your floors are dark to begin with, or your grout is dark, it won't know what to do.\n\nIt's also quite slow, moves less than half-speed compared to my roomba. That's fine for me, it does a good job, but it takes quite a long time to clean a room.\n\nThe shinebot has a very sensitive transition sensor. I have a 1/2 inch ramp transition from my kitchen to living room - the shinebot will go down the transition without problems, but it can't navigate back up. It's wall sensor is not great, sometimes it senses walls/cabinets and doesn't touch them, other times it rams into them repeatedly. It sometimes gets stuck in a corner. Re-setting the programming helps when it's navigation gets stuck in a loop.\n\nIt requires quite a bit of manual intervention & maintenance. This is not a robot you set down and come back to find a clean floor. After running it a few times, I was able to anticipate what it would get stuck re-arrange items so it could navigate better, but I still get random 'clean nose-wheel' errors that require nothing more than nudging the shinebot to get it moving again.\n\nAfter about 3 months of use the water outlets got clogged and I had to take it apart and clean them. There is a warranty, but you'd have to mail the robot back into them and I didn't want to be without it for weeks, so I took it apart myself (I was also curious about the inner workings).\n\nFor me, the low price point and the quality of the clean I get when this works makes it well worth the maintenance required. I expect that future models will improve the performance and design.", "I purchased the ILife Shinebot W400s to clean the quarry tile floor of our large irregularly shaped kitchen. The soil we wanted to target was light dirt, food spills, light scuff marks and pet food residue. My plan was to run it often enough that it would only have to do a light cleaning each time. We have tried it for about a month now and I would return it if I were able.\nRobotic Intelligence\nThis bot is not nearly as \"intelligent\" as many robotic vacuum counterparts (e.g., Roborock). The Shinebot would make a single pass over our kitchen floor and regularly did not to go to all corners of the room. I don't know if this happened because our kitchen is such an odd shape or if it was beyond the Shinebot's abilities. On the plus side, it was sensitive to obstacles (such as cats and food bowls) and did not run over anything.\nCleaning Ability\nThis bot passes one time over its designed path and does not return. The only \"scrubbing\" the floor gets is the microsecond that the roller brush makes contact with that portion of the floor. I know it picked up some dirt, because the water coming out of the used water tank was dirty. However, it typically left spots of very light dirt. Generally, the floor had a streaky appearance after mopping.\nEase of Use\nSetting up and putting this bot away requires time. Plan on spending at least 10 minutes of set up and tear down. Of course one has to fill the tank and set it into place to begin, but the necessary cleaning after each use is time-consuming, stinky and messy. Although I cleaned the roller after each time, washed out the tanks, and wiped out the grime from the underside, the unit developed a sour, dirty smell after the second use. The lightly scented cleaning concentrate provided with the Shinebot covered the smell only a little.\nOther Features\nI think that the concept of a clean water/dirty water tank is good. Who wants to continue to wash your floor with dirty water? However, these tanks make the unit rather heavy. If you are in any way disabled or have trouble lifting things off the floor, this may be problematic. The robot has to be lifted off its storage tray and placed on the floor.\nThe unit comes with a remote control which we never tried because its features seemed redundant.\nThe floor was never unduly wet after a the robot passed over. It did a good job vacuuming up the dirty water.\nSummary\nSince I cannot return the Shinebot, I may continue to use it when/if I have the time and am willing to be satisfied with a job halfway done. Therefore, I would give it 2.5 stars out of 5. I hope this was helpful in your decision.", "I have Roomba S9+, their most expensive vacuum, and I love it. I was all set to by the Braava Jet M6, their whole-home-mapping fully automated robot when I realized that a) it cannot cross room dividers and b) you have to change pads pretty much every time it mops. So unlike the S9+, which can go into any room in your house (no stairs, obviously) and empties its bin after it's done, the Braava M6 is not a true automated solution. You have to intervene each time it mops. I figured if I had to do that, I might as well get an inexpensive basic model. I almost got the Braava 240 or the Samsung thing that moves on two buffing pads. I'm glad I didn't.\n\nThis is, I believe, the best mopping robot on the market. First, it's a real automated mop. It doesn't just scrub the floor with the same dirty pad. It sucks up the dirty water into a separate tank and the spinning buffer gets refreshed with clean water as it moves along. Second, while it doesn't have app integration or mapping features, it does create an internal map each time it mops, which means it methodically cleans whatever area you put it in. The small water reservoir is enough for about 1500 square feet, possibly more. That means it can mop most of the average person's home on one tank. It comes with floor cleaning solution, a cleaning tool and a replacement roller.\n\nI am really impressed with the navigation and internal maps. It has some sort of front IR sensor, gyroscope and accelerometer and seems to know where in the room it is as it makes its map. It slows down before colliding with objects, just like my S9 with its laser \"time of flight\" sensor. It also cannot cross room dividers (like the Braava M6) and does not ride up onto rugs, but being confined to a room is a good thing with this robot, as it lets it mop only the room you put it in.\n\nI absolutely love this thing. I don't see a lot of information about this robot on YouTube and I hope the company is doing well, because they are the only ones who seem to understand consumer needs in this product space. If they go under I will buy as many of these things as I can, so that I always have one. I can't recommend it highly enough.\n\nOne caveat...it cleans the floor well, but not spectacularly. About as well as my Bissel upright plug in \"mop,\" but not as well as a real mop, provided you put some muscle into cleaning. The way I see it, this is to clean moderately dirty floors and keep them clean. Not to clean something disgusting that hasn't been mopped in months. Provided you go into it with that understanding, you will not be disappointed.", "I'm impressed by this, it does the job really well as long as you don't expect too much. What I'm most impressed with his how smart it is. Just when you think it missed a a spot it comes back and does it. The cleaner they give with it smells nice and does clean good but... this just doesn't have the liquid storage capacity to truly be a life changer. Your clean water tank will empty before your dirty water tank fills, maybe twice. The design is really good and the concept behind it works. Every other robot mop basically just drags wet swifter or wet pad around. Big woop. This would be perfect for someone who keeps a clean house and clean floors and needs touch-ups and can navigate a fairly large area. That's not the case with my big messy self and my big messy dogs and my huge areas of hard and linoleum floors. If this thing had bigger tanks and was more on a commercial scale it would be a life-changer for me. You'll have to pull my robot vacuums out of my cold dead hands but this just can't take the place of serious mopping. If your house is basically clean to begin with, this probably will work great for you. It is fun to play with and watch and I am impressed by how smart it is. It's exactly what I need it's just not big enough for my miracle mopping solution. The battery is really good and the remote works well. I was surprised that doesn't self dock like every robot vacuum, I suspect there's a good reason for that because leaking potential. I really wish it just 3 times bigger. I'm giving it 4 stars because it really is a great design and it's functions good and it probably would work well for someone who has a basically clean house all the time.", "Great mop. Does an incredible job of cleaning. But their customer service is also a very strong vacuum -- it sucks. They do not answer their tech line with a live person, just a recording that asks you to leave a message and then they will call back. Email -- I did get a response, but it was \"we don't work on weekends\" -- really, that was their response when I asked about help with using the app! That and instructions for *downloading* the app.\n\nNow I have lost my filter, a crucial part for the robot, apparently. But replacements are not listed anywhere! Normally, I'd just call and ask them -- but I already know they won't answer my call or call me back. So I jury rigged a filter with some material I have. Not good!\n\nSum: great vacuum, really needs 'smart' mapping or perhaps just better instructions on how to use the app; horrific customer service.\n\n--------\nUpdate: Before writing the above review, I called them (no answer) and emailed. Then I wrote the review. Remarkably, they just emailed me back, very helpfully! So apparently email is the way to go. Raising back to a 4-star; would be 6 stars (kind of like 'going to 11') if the app was just a bit smarter and I could save a reuse a previous zone from my history.", "I was not expecting miracles and it does a so so job. I think it worked better when I turned the volume of water down to the #1 level and ran 2x in the same area. I ran it after my Neato vacuumed and it still seemed to get a little clogged with dog hair but my dog was in the area and was probably still shedding her fibers of love joy and happiness. The next time I run it I will not allow my dog in the area and see if it will work better. I am disappointed in the suction it doesn\u2019t seem to have a strong suction to it. When I go to empty the waste bin there is not as much water as I expected to be in there but the floor wasn\u2019t really wet either and dried fairly quickly. The cleaner I am on the fence about. I\u2019m not sure how well it cleans, there is no smell to it so that is not an issue. The instruction book does say that it doesn\u2019t work well with uneven tile or large grout lines. Which I wouldn\u2019t consider my tile to be but I am curious if it would work better on linoleum.\nI have only used it twice so I\u2019m still learning the ropes and I haven\u2019t got it hooked up to WiFi yet so I can\u2019t grade that. But it does seems to recognize carpet or rugs but if your rug is at a grout mark and is not raised enough it will go on to the rug. I have a cowhide rug that it did jump onto the rug in a couple spots but I was able to stop it. When using I put the magnetic strips under rug to raise it and it was fine after that.\nI have four dogs so my only expectation was to \u201chelp\u201d keep the floors clean. I think if I was to run it a couple times a week in the kitchen area and by the doors the dogs come in and out of from the back yard it would be ok.\nIf your expecting it to deep clean then you will be disappointed in this robot. Although the $300 price tag seems high, if your using a spray bottle and a pad across your floor\u2026it cleans better than that. It is easy enough to clean out the bin holding the dirty water. The floor scrubber comes with a bottle of cleaner, extra roller and a couple cleaning tools. But the instructions only tell you to rinse out after use.", "We have 4 dogs and a cat. After having my robot vacuums run, I place this guy wherever I need it most and it does a nice job. Without the app I don't have the control I would like, but it still does a good enough job. The cheaper model may have sufficed.

Overall this is a good brand that has been around a while and they work great!", "Three teenage daughters and it\u2019s needless to say, they go through pads like I do tacos. \ud83c\udf2e\nThis is a great supply for us. Each box lasted each kid a full two months. The stickiness is a great medium strength. Some brands have them super sticky that if your not careful and apply to much pull for the amount of stickiness, you\u2019ll get pad slapped in the face. :::Cue the odd visual::: don\u2019t forget, you\u2019re removing it, so it\u2019s dirty \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\nLol, so while these do have a secure strong hold, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s like a super strong hold. Which is super nice, they also don\u2019t unravel in the trash can when on the occasion someone rolls up the used one without putting it in the new pads wrapper. A recent other brand we used would often cause the pad to unravel even when in the wrapper and then in turn someone would either get yelled at by me or their siblings cause ain\u2019t nobody need to see what day your on. \ud83d\ude12\nThese also absorb a great deal, cause I noticed the hand washed hanging underwear next to the peroxide in a squirt bottle have been less and less, and two of my daughters requested these specifically for thier next replacement box. I keep them with one large full box or two smaller boxes per each kid. and when the big box is half way, or they\u2019re opening the last smaller sized box, they have to tell me or they have to use toilet paper \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f lol. So these are a great design and the wings don\u2019t cause any complaints. Because I will hear about it if they did. \ud83d\ude13 While we have used this brand for years and years, with three users of sanitary products in addition to myself, yeah it gets expensive\u2026 so sometimes I have to buy a more value sized pack or a different brand if I can save a couple bucks, but we always come back to Kotex brand. This style is a redesigned improved style I believe. Because I truly have seen a decrease in unfortunate mishaps and these fit various bodies well I think. This is a great value and you get lots of bang for your buck with this!", "I recently tried these as a substitute for the Always I've grown up with. I like the design - where the wings are, the shape of them, and the wear was pretty comfortable. For price, these are OK - it's around what I would usually pay. While I would use them for a lighter day, I might hesitate to do an overnight wear, due to the shape. I'll continue to try these out and see if they can hold up to working out in summer outside or some sleep wear, too. This set is identical to the other one I got, except in bulk - which has the added benefit of being more economical.", "These are great pads. I like how thin and comfortable they are. I know these are for periods but I use them for when I have to use medicine in that area, to keep my undies clean.\n\nI feel like these are more comfortable than some pads that make me feel sweaty after awhile. These really stay clean and dry feeling.\n\nThe sticky stuff stays put like it should. The only downside to me is that they are a little pricey if you are using them for periods. (over $9 per package) I do not mind for my usage but that seems excessive.\n\nThanks for reading my review\n\nBecky Brooks", "It\u2019s funny because you don\u2019t really think of the words \u201cthin\u201d and \u201cheavy\u201d to be able to go together but these get the job done. I typically like thin pads and not the ones that make you feel like your wearing a diaper. With that being said though, sometimes I have a cycle with a couple days of heavy flow and I need something absorbent. I like these U by Kotex CleanWear Ultra Thin Feminine Pads with Wings because they are comfortable and you don\u2019t really feel it, but it\u2019s also absorbent and can get you through long \u201cperiods\u201d of heavy bleeding. I haven\u2019t had any issues with leaking and I\u2019ve let some of them go longer than I should. I\u2019m also a big fan of any pads with wings to give some extra mess-proof defense. I think pads should be even be made without wings because they\u2019re the most genius part of a pad.\n\nWhen it comes to price these are coming out to .28 a pad right now which is decent for heavy pads since some I just looked at were priced at .35+ per pair. 120 will last me a lot of cycles so I\u2019m not too worried about the price.\n\nAnd not that this sways my opinion, but these do come in fun patterned packaging!"]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QQTQNDC", "title": "SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A 8.0-inch Android Tablet 64GB Wi-Fi Lightweight Large Screen Feel Camera Long-Lasting Battery, Black", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/71HX44IWA7L._AC_SX679_.jpg", "ratings": "2,849 ratings", "description": "Large screen feel.

Even when the ad is feature the product as if the actor is activity it for the first time. So perhaps the amount of liquid is as intended.

The other scents, available from other sellers, are Bamboo and Fresh Linen, and they, too, are delightful. None of them are heavy or perfume-like, and all of them do a great job at eliminating unwanted odors. They make your house smell like you just cleaned it thoroughly and opened the windows to let the fresh, fragrant air inside.\n\nThese also keep the house fresh if you have to be gone for a time, say, on vacation, and have to keep the house closed. We've all come home to a closed house and found it musty smelling and in need of an airing. Well, if you use these, you'll come home to a berry patch, instead, and that's a lot better.\n\nI was surprised at how long these little beauties lasted, too. You really get a lot of bang for your buck. They aren't refillable, but they also aren't costly, so there's really no problem there.\n\nIf you want to freshen a large kitchen, cafe, family room area like I have, you'll have to look elsewhere.

Also the batteries don't seem to last as long on a full charge as they did when new so you either open them up to replace them or bite the bullet and buy a new tablet. This is generally what I do and I've been sticking with Samsung for many years.\n\nSamsung makes a great product and this Galaxy Tab S7 works well. You can find plenty of reviews online.\n\nMy only real complaint is that this one is heavier than my previous tablets so it's more of a chore to hold for a long time such as when watching several TV shows in a row or a full-length movie. My iPad is lighter as are my previous Samsung tablets. Otherwise this is as good as any other Galaxy model.\n\nBe very aware this does not have a 3.5mm audio jack so you either have to use the built in speakers or a Bluetooth headset/earbuds.\n\nI highly recommend Samsung's tablet for anyone wanting to stick with Android.", "I bought the S8 (I liked the smaller size) and that it will be getting security updates longer than the S7. But the main use is for streaming and the difference between the S7+ OLED and the S8 TFT is SUBSTANTIAL in Dark Scenes and there are a surprising number of dark scenes in movies. YouTube videos would be fine, etc. but movies and TV shows really demand a superb screen and the S7+ brings it. (I got the S7+ for LESS than the s8 during Amazon Prime days so it was a no brainer. The s8+ was beyond my price limit.)\n\nThe only downside to the S7+ is the size. It is a BIG tablet and hard to handle with one hand by the time you put a quality cover on it.\n\nP.S.\nI called Amazon support to confirm that a seller of Amazon.com versus just Amazon was essentially the same thing and they confirmed I was buying new. (Always check the seller..)", "Got this for drawing digitally, and painting digitally, while on the go. Works very well for that. I bought an Infiland Multi-angle Business Folio cover/ foldout case for it, which acts as a stand so i can draw while sitting in the car or in a park or whatever in comfort- It has a magnetic closure, plus a cut out for the pen to stick to the tablet, and a flap that closes down over the pen to hold it inplace- which was the main reason i bought it since i have a tendency to lose things easily. The case puts the tablet t sleep when it's closed, which is a nice feature too-\n\nThe Camera on it- Meh- Not real great- Not a lot of details in the photos, a bit on the mushy looks side- I wouldn't use the cameras for taking photos that I would keep as family photos, but they are good enough for sharing online i suppose.\n\nThe battery life? Meh- get a couple of hours Drawing, haven't really tested it by draining it yet- i usually use the machine about 2-5 hours, then recharge when it's about anywhere from 30-60%. The battery life is nowhere near the stated 'optimal case scenario'- But that was to be expected for those who do heavy work on them.\n\nThe pen works a treat- Really like it. Only issue is that they don't sell replacement nibs apparently? Which would mean havign to buy a whole new pen if the nib wears out- I guess they claim the nib is made so it won't wear out too quick- but we'll see-\n\nGraphics are really nice- Not sure how the 'burn in' is going to affect this tablet- So far it's fine- no ghosting that I've noticed. I have removed all but three of my most used icons from front page, and i keep rearranging them on the screen every couple of days. Not sure if this is going to help, but we'll see- Love the deep darks on this tablet- makes working in painting apps very nice- Haven't tried watching a movie with it yet- but I'm betting it's gonna look fantastic based on what I've seen so far.\n\nThe tablet does come with a bunch of stuff I wish i could just get rid of, but unfortunately Samsung doesn't allow you to delete some of their proprietary apps. If I'm gonna pay a lot of dough for something, I'd like to be able to decide what apps i have on it or not- to be able to reclaim some of the space they take up- but oh well-\n\nI bought a 400gb Samsung Extreme micro SD card for it which extends the storage quite a bit. It seems to be a bit slow accessing it though, which surprised me. In my desktop computer, it accesses almost instantly, but on the table it takes a good 8 seconds or so before you can see the files on the SD card-\n\nThe MicroSD Card Slot is locked in, so you'll need a paper clip or the provided tool to unlock the slide in casing for the card- but once it's locked in, you shouldn't need to take it out if all you want it for is backup storage. It will be a pain though if I want to take the card out to transfer contents to desktop or other laptops- but oh well- Woulda just been nice if it had a slide locking mechanism or something to unlock the case for the card\n\nOver all, so far, the tablet is very nice- just what i need for on the go drawing and painting- Haven't had it long enough to comment on other apps on it- but the ones i use work wonderfully- quite pleased so far with the purchase\n\nI also bought a Anker USB C Cable, Powerline USB 3.0 to USB C Charger Cable (10ft) with 56k Ohm because the supplied power chord was too short. This chord is thick, well made- and works a treat- plugs right into the fast charger head of the Samsung provided charger- and charges the tablet very quickly. Takes about I guess 10 minutes to charge an 80% charged tablet i would guess? Maybe a bit longer or shorter- haven't really timed it, but it's plenty quick\n\nSo back to the table itself- The size is just right from drawing on on the go. The only downside to the aspect ratio is that some apps or pages don't render right- they only render in portrait mode it seems- but no big deal for me- though it might be for some folks-\n\nThe tablet is very responsive- fast for the most part, except for accessing the SD card-", "I was an early adopter of Android tablets many years ago. I found tablets to be not ready at all for mass-marketat the time. The exception to this were the Apple Ipads, but they were limited in functionality even though very slick. Since, I have been using android Phablet Style smartphones and have become quite used to them. They all have their quirks and differences and most do not shine. Since, I travel a decent amount, I found lugging a laptop or Chromebook around to be just that and not useful as power-hungry devices. While on a crowded airplanes flight, I watched John Wick 3 over-the-shoulder of another passenger via his S7. Even though there was no sound, I was delighted at the amazing resolution and media play of the movie. I resolved then and there did I would buy one after the price came down, cuz I was balking at the $700 price tag. My patience was rewarded and I got a pretty decent discount last fall.\n\nI really like the device, the pen, and the ability to draw and take notes. The sound is rich and full and does not need headphones to hear clearly like other devices who sound tinny and distorted. However, there are USB C Jack's to 3.5 mm headphone plugs readily available for not much money, or you can Bluetooth.\n\nThere are other positives about this device such as it is lightweight and has a long battery life. And memory can be extended to 1 terabyte which I think is pretty impressive.\n\nNow to the little bit of the bad oh, I'm going to be brutally honest about it. I am here in the Google/ Android ecosystem and rely upon my account for password storage and this usually works seamlessly across Android devices and Chrome browser. Once I set up the device with my Google account usually it's no problem to access my passwords once I've installed the apps that need them. Not so in this case with Samsung. It wants you to join their ecosystem oh, and I see no reason duplicate everything which I find to be insecure and overly complicated. In this day and age it's a real nightmare because everyone demands passwords that are complicated and impossible to keep track of by yourself. I am not interested in installing third party key ring managers to try and mitigate this. The password autofill culpability in this device is very complicated to set up if you're not using a Samsung account even though my device which is logged into my Google account. Overall, I find the settings to be extremely fussy and difficult to use in general and not very intuitive in setting up and across some of the apps provided. I have spent hours and hours trying to establish better usability in this regard, and I feel that this is the main drawback to the Galaxy S7. I do not say that it ruins the experience, but I am less likely to buy another Samsung product particularly a phone because of this. In addition, the keyboard swipe works like crap in landscape mode, and the dictionary is atrocious. I might be able to fix the dictionary by finding a more compatible database. Of course I have to mention Google speech to text is almost unusable without clearly and loudly enunciating each syllable of every single word no matter how simple. Not something you want to do in public you will look like a crazy person! Google speech definition used to be pretty good now crap across all of their devices. Practically useless and on this S7 it is no difference. Hopefully this gets resolved\n\nGreat look, performance, sound also. Disappointingly, still not ready for prime time due to aforementioned issues and others that have yet to reveal themselves.\n\nAdmittedly, you'll probably have a much easier time with this tablet if you just acquiesce and join the Samsung ecosystem. Of course, that means they will win and you will be under their thumb and I can assure you and they can be as arbitrary and hamfisted as Google.\n\nGood luck buy on sale only.", "The screen on this tablet is very pretty. It is a pleasure to watch videos. Drawing on this tablet is pretty good too, but there are compromises as compared to a desktop setup with a multi thousand dollar Cintiq. I can drag the pen across the surface without triggering, so it could be a little more sensitive. The tilt for the pen in many apps is just ok at best. I think the apple pencil feels the best for tilt, but tilt in digital isnt a thing yet I dont think. The responsiveness of the line is great and the jitter is minimal. The parallax is also good, but the further you get off center the worse it is. The pen type drifts out from under the pen when approaching edges and the sensitivity goes way down.", "I love the tablet and its performance. I use it daily.\n\nIn my experience, the handy dandy new fancy schmancy S-Pen does not have the most resilient nib. The soft rubber \"broke\" within the first month. Unlike its predecessors, you cannot replace the nib on this S-Pen.\n\nSo, I purchased one of the older S-Pens in which you can replace the nibs, and it is working fine with the new pen.\n\nHowever, I cannot get the tablet to forget its old friend and is constantly reminding me that it is missing it. I have not found a way to make the tablet let go of this old relationship. Time heals all wounds, but that does not seem to be the case here. Maybe the tablet remembers the sexiness of the old pen, and longs for better days.\n\nAt any rate, this tablet would be 5 stars if it were not for the new fancy schmancy pen it came with.", "Exceeded my expectation , better than any ipad i v tested): Fast, great screen, extendable memory(1 TB, fast SD), great app collection, long battery life (active 10+ hours), excellent pen feel & latency, and handwriting recognition.\nCON:\nKeyboard + case protection not included and expensive.\nCannot easily feel or see button on SPen.\nCannot remove the most hated and useless Bixby (voice assistant and AI), which works terribly .", "I received the product. Good condition. Very useful. Using it as a streaming device is fantastic. Good resolution and volume. I use it for writing using the S notes. Spen is very sensible. I recommend it", "I've had it for over a year now and I love it. It does everything i need it to. The battery is still great and the screen quality is fantastic.", "This tablet is a beast, one of the best devices I've purchased in the last few years, and here's why:\n- Portability: this thing has a wonderful compact design, light, easy to carry along with your phone and wallet, no need to put it in a bag, just pick it and go. When travelling for vacation, I don't carry my laptop anymore, I just take this beast with me instead.\n- Laptop experience: once connected to the keyboard, you already have a small capable laptop. Keyboard is tiny, but surprisingly comfortable while typing. Mouse pad works well, you can also attach a wireless mouse if needed. You can attach an external monitor to the tablet to get a dual screen mode for multitasking, you will need to use DEX in this case.\n- Pen: the pen is pretty good, runs smoothly on the screen, delay is almost unnoticable. Quite useful when signing digital documents, no need to print and scan documents anymore!\n- Multi tasking: this is the best part for me. I can watch a youtube video in one tab, take notes in a second tab, facebook messanger open in a third tab, and google translate hovering in a fourth tab, all tabs look clean on the screen and navigation between them is so easy. You can even save all your open apps as one icon and get back to it later if needed.\n- Battery: baterry life is great. I use the tablet a lot throughout the day, watching youtube and TV, internet surfing, listening to music, etc..., it last easily for a day with some power left for the next day. If you're not a heavy user, battery can last for days.\nSound and display: speakers are so loud and clear, much better than I expected. Display is great, colors look so sharp. Watching youtube, movies and TV series on it a great experience. You can wirelessly connect to a smart TV to get a larger display if needed.\nSo many things to love about this device, highly recommended.", "I really loved this tab, very user friendly, battery is pretty decent, sound is awesome. The only issue I have is with the pen, the nib is way to fragile and it brakes easily. I suggest buying the replacement nibs with the tab. Overall I\u2019m in love with this tablet.", "- Gorgeous Bright Screen\n- Fantastic Pen with a rubbery nib that gives you nice resistance on the screen's glass surface\n- Surprisingly Good Speakers\n- Expandable Micro SD Storage\n- Holds Its Battery When Not In Use\n- No Slowdown When Doing Art\n- Handy Front-facing Camera\n\n------------\n------------\nOWNED FOR 5 MONTHS:\n\nFIRST and FOREMOST, I purchased this tablet to use as a pen display for my Windows PC. Tab S7+ connects to your PC in a number of ways, both wireless and wired. You can either mirror your tablet screen to your PC or your PC screen to your tablet. But these baked-in features, though good in certain ways, are not robust enough to give you a premium digital pen display experience.\n\nTo use Tab S7 as a high quality pen display with your desktop art apps, I recommend Superdisplay - a $15 app that you'd download onto your tablet through Google Play store. Superdisplay only works on Windows OS currently. Additionally, you might want to buy a 6 feet (usb-c male to usb-a male) cable because you'll want a nice wired connection to eliminate lag while avoiding the frustration of a short plug chaining you too close to your PC tower. I also purchased a Parblo PR 100 tablet stand so that my Tab S7 would be angled up rather than lying completely flat. A small mini bluetooth keyboard rounds out my pen display setup.\n\nWhen using this as a pen display (through the Superdisplay app), I use Photoshop, Illustrator, ArtRage, After Effects - basically everything I use on my PC can be interacted with on my Tab S7+. The S Pen itself is nearly perfect in my opinion, and you get all your pressure sensitivity inside your art apps. And you can extend your PC screen to your Tab in either portrait or landscape. It only takes a small time to get used to the setup, but once you do, it becomes an easy plug-and-play. Connect your usb-c cord when you want a pen display; remove the cord when you just want to use it as a standalone tablet.\n\n------------\n------------\n\nSmall Gripes:\n- As a 12.4 inch tablet, using desktop apps in portrait mode takes some getting used to within the narrow space. I can see the advantage of the extra space of iPad Pro's 12.9 inch screen, BUT this small issue isn't big enough to make me opt for an iPad. I value the openness of the Android OS.\n\n- Battery life is great when using the Tab for regular tablet stuff. But when it comes to doing serious art, the battery life can drop from about 10hrs to about 4hrs. Rarely am I far away from a power source longer than 4hrs though.\n\n- As a HEAVY user of the S Pen, I'm rounding down the pen nib. Tab S7 does not come with replacement nibs. I spoke with Samsung about this and they decided to send me another S Pen, but the pen that came with the unit is not worn away completely. I still use it.\n\n- Android art apps are not as numerous as on Apple's platform, but among the selection available on Android are high quality and professional level apps. Noteworthy for my illustration work are Clip Studio and Infinite Painter. Sketchbook Pro and ArtRage are good ones too.\n\n------------\n------------\n\nDrawing on this Tab S7+ as a pen display or just a tablet has been heavenly.", "The table runs well but where it fall short is when attempting to use it as an actual laptop. A lot of the websites do not work as if they were real desktop sites. I have school work to do and some of the stuff off of Canvas is not supported which is a bummer. I really wanted to love the tablet but it did let me down.Get a real laptop.", "The display quality is awesome and the device is fast not slow even they deliver it quickly, also I bought 1TB SanDisk SD memory card and it works fine!", "I can't give a fair review of the product as my judgement was clouded by the quality and presentation of my delivery.\n\nIn short, I was sent a used item when I ordered new (with payment installments). Amazon prompted need for signature, took time off to meet driver for signature, had a mini panic attack when app alerted the package was signed and given to resident. It was not. It was placed on the side of my residence (the usual spot). The Prime box was sealed, however, the actual tablet box was not (there are two clear stickers on the bottom that need to be broken so access to the tablet is possible). It, the Samsung box, was filthy and the box was dented. The box is cosmetic, so, not an issue.\n\nWrong. I open the box (again, seal already tampered with) to see the tablet in its temporary cover. Picked it up and moved it aside, didn't open yet. Slot where s-pen was supposed to fit/be was empty aside for a SNAPPED and BROKEN off tip. S-pen itself found clinging behind tablet. Functional Bluetooth settings but unable to be used as stylus. Okay. At least it's not lost.\n\nCharger was in box haphazardly with unknown debris in box. I didn't check to see if it was functional. I was frustrated and anxious to assess tablet's quality.\n\nMoved to tablet in temporary cover. Seal looks heat gunned shut. A reseal, not original. Broke seal, removed tablet. Little to no cosmetic issues or scratches.\n\nTurned on. Interface smooth. Tablet at 13%. Used personal charger to charge to 100% then unhooked. Complete. Connected it to my wi-fi. Boom! Dynamite! Tablet is vibrant, crisp, the sound and video quality 10/10, noticed unable to use finger as stylus for Samsung installed apps, tablet did not recognize I wanted to use finger instead of stylus to doodle as s-pen was inoperable (not an issue on Galaxy S7+ FE), while exploring factory given apps, the tablet would occasionally overheat (unsure if it's this specific tablet or for Galaxy in general), tablet was propped on a stand with no heavy programs running, just factory apps, no reason for that degree of heat.\n\nBrightness on low, with vivid mode off, battery drained quickly from 100% to 60% after about an hour using factory apps, no YouTube yet. Not sure if tablet or Galaxy product in general.\n\nYouTube video quality was clear, crisp, true to life and quality of original uploader. Way different from the S7+ FE. Loved it.\n\nCamera was nice and clear. Not grainy and void of color like the S7+ FE (I returned it for this reason and lack of fingerprint scanner).\n\nBought tablet for work and illustration projects.\n\nOverall, I called Amazon customer service, they were great in getting me an immediate and full refund on the tablet and insurance I purchased for the item as it was no longer in stock. I called their tech service around 11am. The representative immediately consulted their supervisor. Their was no \"haggling\" on methods for keeping or reordering the product, just immediate action.\n\nMy experience was biased due to how I received the product, however, I would 100% purchase this tablet over the others in the S7 series. It's worth it. However, I would hesitate purchasing such an expensive item from Amazon (personal opinion). This was my first negative experience, with a media product, with Amazon. First and last. I will purchase again at another retailer, where I can hold the item physically in my hands from store to my home.", "I've worked with the 10\" Tab S6, and also with the Tab S8 Ultra, and have found the 12.4\" Tab S7+ is the best size providing a large display but maintaining portability.", "My review written from the POV of a casual user and occasional business use. 7+ 256k\nPros:\nGreat hardware, screen is great, incredibly fast processor, great sound quality from 4 speakers, and battery life. Super fast.\nGoogle ecosystem which I like. On IOS, never sure what IOS remembers about your preferences such as passwords or Google.\nCheaper than comparable Apple tablets in size category.\nGreat for entertainment, big screen and big sound.\nBusiness software is comparable to IOS, Adobe, etc. I use WPS Office for most things as this a cheaper subscription service that does some things MS Office does not.\nSeriously close to a laptop in capability - closer to a laptop than a smaller tablet. Can use a mouse, keyboard, etc. Lots of memory, you will never run out, can add more memory.\n\nCons:\nSamsung bloatware still a nuisance but just ignore it.\nMust use external keyboard as the built in keyboard is obstructed by the Android buttons on the bottom, very awkward for me. This dings the rating but the keyboard does have arrow keys which the Apple does not, go figure.\nSamsung's Windows emulator is very clunky and not ready for prime time. Not a reason to buy.\nLack of apps for Android tablets, as many of said, most of the apps are for phones. Apps must stretch to fill the screen, just not as good as IOS. Don't assume an IOS app is available for Android as hard as that to believe as Android is the number 1 selling phone system. EG, newspapers are not optimized, so use the browser to view them better. Save the tab on your home screen. This keeps it from 5 star rating.\nThe large screen is good and bad - good for business applications but can be awkward for casual usage. Same for Apple of same size.\nNot everyone will love the horizontal orientation of the screen. That's a preference.\n\nSo it's a tough choice between Apple and Samsung. Figure out the cost and what's important to you. I also have Apple tablets, the 9.7\". I needed a larger screen for music applications and the 7+ works great.\nIf you just want the big sharp screen with less power and memory, consider the 7FE, way cheaper and still fast and good.\n\nThe Tab 8 has just been released with a 14 .2 screen. that's tooo big for a tablet without the total capabilities of a laptop.", "Good for drawing, media consumption, multi tasking everything", "", "Very fast, cool S-pen feature, great sound, awesome display and monster battery life. My Tab S2 does fine for most things, but this new S7+ just blows it away.

Must buy! Only overnight diaper we trust!", "Great diaper have been using for May years now, would not put anything else on my babies for night time sleep.", "These overnight diapers are a great fit our little one!! It absorbs so much and is the best brand on the market. They last from the time we put her to sleep til the morning!", "These are MUCH more absorbent than Huggies Little Movers and Huggies Little Snugglers ... using them at night has been a good thing for us. Recommended for overnight.", "We had been buying the Huggies Day & Night diapers and they were not good enough for the noghts.\nWhen we started to buy Huggies Overnight all changed\u2026 they have a good absorption and the baby remains dry all night.", "We used pampers exclusively since our son was born. But at around a year and a half we started having lots of leaks in the pampers overnight diapers. We tried adding sposies, plastic diaper covers, going up a size, and changing in the middle of the night and we\u2019d still get woken up with diaper leaks most nights!! I researched and researched and decided to give Huggies overnight diapers a try\u2026. AMAZING! Why isn\u2019t there more emphasis on the style and fit of these diapers!?! They have a double closure design. First \u2018attach spot\u2019 is near the sides at the hips and is soft, and the second is in front. This is especially effective for boys to help prevent leaks up the sides. And the style seems way more comfortable around the legs as the main tab lays in front and can\u2019t dig the legs if your baby/toddler moves a lot. Sooo glad we gave these a try! Wish I\u2019d tried them sooner!! Totally awesome. We now have far fewer diaper leaks. We do still have leaks on occasion if my son has had a lot of water- he can exceed capacity. But I\u2019m so grateful to Huggies for this awesome design- comfy and secure- definitely helped our nights!! Highly recommend giving them a try.", "My daughter will sleep 12 hours and now no more 2 am changes! We were waking to change her when using the original huggies because by morning, everything would be soaked! I\u2019m so glad I decided to try them.

I've tried other brands like Honest and Hello Bello, but these are the only ones that I rarely get leaks with as long as I have the right size. I do usually go a size up from the daytime diaper size.

I work long hours and have two VERY large dogs that normally get taken out to potty, but are also trained to go on pee pads if nobody is home and they have to go.\n\nLet me tell you- these guys produce as much urine per pee as a large beer-drinking adult male lol. Needless to say, I\u2019ve tried many different brands to see if they\u2019re up to the task, and I\u2019ve had to clean up SO many overflows, even if I do 2 or 3 layers of disposable pee pads.\n\nSo far, the Simple Solution \u201cAll Day\u201d variety (NOT the regular kind) have been the absolute best at absorbing the largest quantity of urine without leaking for their size.\nI\u2019ve also done my own tests to measure the max limit of cups of water each brand can absorb, and the \u201cAll Day\u201d pads by Simple Solution far out-absorb their competitors. I could get a full 8 cups before it started overflowing or leaking.\nThe next best brand was Four Paws \u201cWee Wee Pads\u201d, but their normal pads and their \u201cextra absorbent\u201d pads had VERY little difference in the actual quantity of water absorbed. 2.5-3 cups in regular vs 3.5 in the extra absorbent. Psh. But they did perform better and prevent more leaks than a bunch of other lower end pads I tried.\n\nAfter a few months of buying pee pads and seeing how many trash bags I filled up each week, tossing them out each day, I felt so guilty for the constant amount of plastic waste that it was producing, and I also got tired of paying for another box of pads each week! So I forayed into the world of washable pee pads. There are an endless number of brands and some are labeled for people (bedwetting children or the elderly, etc) and some labeled for pets, but as far as how they function and their absorbency, THERES NO DIFFERENCE except the ones for pets may have a cute bone pattern. (Some claim they have an attractant, but my dogs peed on whatever I put in the area they were used to having pee pads in, so I can\u2019t verify).\n\nI tried multiple brands of reusable pads, with a wide variety of quality and absorbency (some were just complete trash) but the absolute BEST one that I found was the IMPROVIA reusable underpad. Unlike others I tried, it has special channels that wick the wetness to the outer edges, where the fabric ALLOWS THE WATER PORTION TO EVAPORATE. WTF!? I was skeptical as always, but after putting it out during the day, when I came home it almost felt dry! Not soaked and heavy like the other brands I had tried. Not only that, but it didn\u2019t stink of pee in the house, either! It blew my mind!\nNow of course, it has its limits, but so far I\u2019ve even had the dogs use it for a few days in a row before washing it, and it\u2019s blown me away with its absorbent capabilities and the evaporation function.\nAnd after washing in the machine, it air dries in an hour (as opposed to other brands, that come out heavy and soaked and take days to air dry).\n\nI\u2019m not a bot, nor do I get paid for any of this info (but once again, I\u2019m poor, so hey, Improvia, if you want to send a little money my way for raving about you to every pet owner I run into, that would be great! Lol).\nBut really, I\u2019m just a pet owner who wants to pass on some helpful info, and also encourage others to pick something more environmentally friendly than disposable pee pads. You don\u2019t have to be a hippie to want to help the planet that you live on- every little thing you do counts!\n\nSo I say, give the reusable kind a try. If you hate them, no big deal- it\u2019s Amazon- just return them! But you might find that they\u2019re actually better than the disposables, and will save you so much money! And if that happens, all I say is \u201cpass the message along\u201d! (And mark this review as \u2018helpful\u2019 so it can be seen by more people) :D\n\nTLDR:\nBest disposable- Simple Solution \u201cAll Day\u201d variety.\nBetter option- IMPROVIA reuseable pads (last all day and then some!) Will save you hundreds of dollars in a short amount of time, and will also help the planet :)", "I bought this for my elderly grandmother and she loves it. It doesn\u2019t soak through and you dont have to change it so often. If it works so well for my grandmother I just know it would work workers for a small child.", "I got these for my sons girlfriend. They\u2019re for her son who is less than a year old and has issues with peeing through his diaper. This will hopefully save my mattress. I\u2019ve let them use my bed/mattress. From what I\u2019ve seen this will work fabulously. It works as described. Thank you for the help with this! It\u2019s greatly appreciated. Good job making this product.", "All I have to say is that these have saved my sanity! I have been getting burnt out on trying to potty train my kid at night. Every night they would pee the bed and every morning I would have to strip the bed, wash alllllll of the dang bedding, then steam clean the mattress protector. I was at my wits end. Then I remembered that when I was a CNA, we used chuck pads. I went on the search for washable chuck pads, and I found this product. I was skeptical, so I bought the 4 pack. At the time of this review the 6 pack is the same amount of money as a bulk buy of pullups. They were a great size. My kid has a queen size bed, and the pads cover almost half the bed, so they will be able to roll over and still be on the pad. They don't slip or slide around. they don't bunch up. they also dry so fast! so my kid won't be rolling around in pee. These are hands down the greatest product for potty training at night.", "I absolutely love these I was buying disposable for my puppy and now I\u2019m saving hundreds of dollars. These wash and dry like new. Absolutely amazing and very happy \ud83d\ude06", "I needed a waterproof pad for potty training. I got so tired of stripping beds and washing bedding everyday, and extremely tired of companies lying about how waterproof their product was. I wasn't going to try any more crazy \"waterproof\" pads, but when I saw this double pack for the cost of others single packs, and it said new. Something about it told me to try. It came super fast. No funky smell when it came out of the package. I decided to test one out before I put on the bed, I placed on couch, I poured 1 cup (8oz) of water right in the middle. My couch was dry!\nThese work! I don't know how, but it starts to dry within 10 mins, the liquid moves to the edges, and it doesn't leak!!\nI am amazed! I wish I had found these and this company years ago!!

Or after a surgery, or elderly parents, point is they're amazing and waterproof!\nAlmost forgot, they're silent!

In May I had a BKA (below knee amputation) on the right leg. Due to this I'm currently bedridden. Using pull ups but leakage occurs. These pads have proven to be the best so far. They are very absorbent. Don't stick to your skin and extremely easy to wash. Just put them in the washing machine and then let air dry. They dry fast! My only complaint is although they are larger than most others, I wish they were just a tad larger. Other than that, they are great. Will definitely be buying more!", "If I had wanted MEDLINE underpads, I would have bought them!\nThe MEDLINE Performax pads may be a good product, yet I chose to buy the IMPROVIA washable pads as they offered a new technology approach to urine wicking.

We have a dog who can't go outside due to allergies and a back surgery from IVDD. He can't walk well. He uses these pads for indoor pottying amd they absorb very well.

I sweat all day everyday and I can smell funky when covered in sweat lol. The scents of these are not strong, which I like, but they do last with me sweating for 12hrs.\n\nSome times the deodorant doesn't want to twist out of the tube, and I read another review that said the same thing, you spin the handle but the deodorant doesn't come up. This only happens maybe 1 out of 9 tubes, but I found there is a circle/button on the very bottom, if it is not pushed in then you need to push that in and it will work. I guess that engages something that connects the handle to the piece in the middle that pushes the deodorant up when it spins.", "I was very skeptical of the deodorant based on some spotty reviews. I am glad I ordered it. This is the best deodorant I have ever tried and it isn\u2019t even a close race. This stuff smells great and I feel like I never sweat. It lasts a long time and doesn\u2019t leave the normal residue like old spice does.\n\nIt isn\u2019t as soft as a normal deodorant bar but that is the only area where it isn\u2019t truly superior to anything I have tried before. I am never going back after this.", "This is a fine deodorant that's free of aluminum and parabens.\nNot sure what else to say. I like it. I'll likely buy more when I run out.\nIt goes on best when your skin is wet. The deodorant can be a bit... hard.\nIt feels like you're applying US Army green & back face paint... if you've ever used that stuff before.\nIt doesn't go on as easily as some \"wetter\" feeling deodorants.\nIdk. It really doesn't bother me, just saying. It might matter to someone?\nAnyway, a good product. Good scent, fair price, not toxic.\nIt's not the only non-toxic deodorant on the market. This product is fine but you might want to consider trying several brands and deciding for yourself which is best for you. I don't have any problems with this product, but I also don't \"swear by it\" like I do with some other things I buy.", "This is overall pretty good. It smells good. Just don\u2019t last too long under extreme working or exercise", "I really liked the smell of all three and they lasted all day. Most importantly they did not cause my skin to break out at all which a lot of others have. They only negative is for some reason they stained my white shirts.

But I do love the beard balm they make and will continue to use that.", "With every other deodorant I used I would get rashes and bumps under my underarms after a few days. I have been using this product for about a month or so and have not seen any allergic reactions to the product. The citrus smell is great and it has been satisfying to find a deodorant that I can use consistently without the worry of skin reactions.", "I've been looking for natural deodorant as the usual stuff like Old Spice and Degree, etc have so many unnatural chemicals. After a little digging I found this stuff. The scent was the big stand out.\n\nPreference as follows:\nSandalwood - good \"manly\" smell that gives off cologne smell which is nice for daily wear. GF loves this one the most.\nPeppermint & Eucalyptus - very strong smell, great for the gym. Scent lasts for a while.\nCitrus - The scent is weak and the application is tougher than the others, almost like it dried out. Since I don't like this scent much and the application is sub par, I feel like I only got 2 usable scents.\n\nI had to dock my rating for a few things\n1. Application - the sticks are not easy to apply. They feel dry and need a few passes to apply enough\n2. Transfer - the applied deodorant is white and can transfer to other clothes easily, which is a bit of a bummer\n\nOverall, I will buy again, most likely a 2 or 3 pack of the sandalwood and the peppermint/eucalyptus, not the variety pack.", "The deodorant goes on easy, is good to my skin and has a pleasant scent (though I wish it was stronger). I feel it offers good protection and you don't need to apply a lot, which makes each stick last quite a long time - longer than virtually every other brand I've ever tried.\n\nI can't buy this product any more because I've had problems with the physical containers themselves. The first time, I turned the wheel and the stick didn't come up. I contacted the company and they replaced it immediately. The replacement containers worked ok, but I had to hold the wheel against the container when I applied, otherwise the stick pushes down and I rub hard plastic against my underarms. I was less than amused by that, but I purchased another 2 pack. The first stick worked ok but I had to hold the wheel when applying it again, and with the second stick, the deodorant doesn't come up when I turn the wheel again. Since this was the 2nd stick, the 30 day return policy had expired so I am out of luck. So 5 out of 6 containers were problematic, with 2 of the 6 being entirely unusable. If they change their containers (and give me a free stick since I had to throw this last, brand new one out) I will buy again because the product itself is rather good.", "I love all three scents. I love that the ingredients are, for the most part, recognizable. I don\u2019t love that it stays in my armpits for days. I cannot scrub this out even with a loofah. My entire armpit feels like a sticky honeycomb during a shower and I wonder if this is coming out or being bushes around my armpit hair.", "Not too strong keeps you from stinking wanted the third scent the most", "Smells a little like wax with scent, and I only say that because I cannot smell the Citrus scent at all. She rubbed some on Her forearm and got it warm she said then I think I could smell it. Kind of a fail on that one, the other two do have a decent but not strong scent.\nThis was me trying new things. will keep trying as i will not buy again. Not a bad product, just not Me.", "Product is relatively comfortable to apply, does work as intended- however, it leaves an oily residue on my shirts that no other deodorant has done. The residue makes it appear that I'm sweating, giving me a \"pitty sweat\" appearance. I just had to scrub my favorite shirt with a detergent soap to try and remove this. I won't be wearing this deodorant anymore for this reason.\nI'll add I love the shaving cream from this company, but I'm not a fan of this deodorant.\n\nEdit: The company saw this review, apologized that I was having issues and refunded my money. That's incredibly generous of them! Especially considering that I didn't ask for, or expect a refund. For that reason I'm adjusting the rating.\n\nReally generous company and they have me as a repeat customer (for their other products).", "So, I think they are on the right path with this line. The scent tho is way more tea tree than anything else which is okay but like super super light fragrance wise. There is like zero eucalyptus which should be the stronger smell. The quality though is perfect. Like, I burn with almost every other deodorant and have been using this for over a month and not even close to irritation on my skin. Up the fragrance guys!", "Deodorant that contains aluminum has caused my armpit lymph nodes to swell. So I've tried aluminum free Tom's & Old Spice lavender. Tom's smelled bad & was useless for odor protection. The Old Spice lavender smelled great, but caused an irritating rash.\n\nSo I found this Viking Revolution, aluminum free & natural!! I used for 24 hours now. 2 applications. Deodorant smells awesome, like cocoa butter. Odor protection was great. Did not irritate or cause any rash. Just a bit small (see pic).\n\nThe company seemed like my type of higher end, man products. BUT, I will NOT purchase again. Great company image & marketing. But this deodorant is MADE IN CHINA. I see the image & clientele that they're trying to appeal to. But I would assume many of us, do not want to put something on our skin, every single day, that is made in China. No thanks. This 2 pack was $10. I'd gladly spend 25% more, if this was made in the USA. Now I'll be looking elsewhere.\n\nUpdate: The company reached out & asked me if I wanted a refund/replacement. I don't. But that is a very good customer service on their part! I just wish they'd manufacturer their products in the USA. I understand China is much cheaper, but customers like myself would pay more for American made. Quality & standard are different in China! As a few reviews have stated \"defective\".", "Having tried major brands like Dr. Squatch and Duke Cannon for alternative deodorants to the ones you'll find in every major supermarket, I found these Viking Revolution sets after some searching and decided for the price it was worth the shot. The packaging is very nice, the quality of the applicator and holder are great, and all three scents were pleasing. The sticks had good life and the scent was long lasting through a work day. The only gripe I had was the extreme dryness of the stick caused hard application. I found I could only apply directly after a shower while still wet otherwise application was difficult.", "It smells great, and last a long time wearing it, and in general.

Since it\u2019s happened more than once we WILL NOT buy more.", "At first, i had no problems with the scent or how long it lasts. However, as the temp got higher and i started to sweat more, i found this product just doesn't work well. I'm not a stinky guy but after a couple hours i started smelling...\n\nPros:\n- Smells really good when first applied\n- The stick itself lasts a decent amount of time (swipes per stick)\n\nCons:\n- REALLY TOUGH at first. I was ripping hairs out...\n- Lasts maybe 4 hours even in AC\n- Scent is great at first but doesnt last\n\nI would not recommend this to anyone. I really wanted to love this..", "The odor control & longevity is quite good. My job is very active most of the day, & only one of the scents smelled weird at end of day.

All of the pink Peptos contain sugar alcohols which are known to cause bloating and diarrhea (WTF??), other artificial sweeteners and artificial colors. Kaopectate contains none of those. Artificial sweeteners and artificial colors can be triggers to people with MC so it all made sense. Switching Kaopectate tablets for Pepto in the protocol has worked for other patients too.

I am 32yo and have recently been dealing with very stubborn cystic acne the cleanser paired with my acne cream was working wonders but leaving my face very dry. So when I saw this moisturizer I thought it would work very well as a new addition. I know it takes time for a product to work right and get used to your skin so I\u2019ve waited to give this review.. and while it is extremely moisturizing ( it felt like I had literally rubbed water on my face ) it was also EXTREMELY oily which I DEFINITELY did not need while trying to clear my face. After about a month of trying it out I finally realized it was not my skin getting used to the product, it was just not going to work for me. My 12yo daughter absolutely loves it though! And it does keep her skin looking beautiful and moisturized. I just do not recommend if you already are experiencing oily skin because it will clog pores and make your face feel like your just rubbing oil all over it.", "I have struggled with dry flaky patches around bottom and sides of nose for 15 years.

No heavy scent, and very lightweight", "I have dry/acne prone skin and I\u2019ve experimented and have had many different acne creams but this one is my favorite! I recently bought a $29 acne cream and this is WAYY better and cheaper. Plus it has a lot of natural ingredients. Because I have eczema and acne most products dry me out or irritate my skin but this helps clear my acne while moisturizing my dry skin. My routine is a cleanser, toner, serum, and then this twice a day. At night I add add thin layer of Argan oil before this for extra moisture. 10/10 would recommend and will update soon with before and after pictures.", "I love that this moisturizer is lightweight and doesnt leave my skin all oily and gross. Pairs awesome with the face wash and toner!", "Couple things!\n\n1) Box came opened and squashed, although seal was in place.\n\n2) Bottle appeared to be about 75% full.\n\n3) I applied this an hour before working out and it instantly started coming off my face as I slowly started to sweat. Almost as if it didn\u2019t absorb into my skin - it just laid on the surface.\n\n4) It is nice and light weight with little to no smell. I could see this being more of a night time cream for sensitive/ oily prone skin. However, did not leave my skin feeling all that hydrated. ( I have clear skin already and small patches of dryness from time to time) Bought this product mainly because of the environmentally conscious message.\n\n5) However, I\u2019m curious to know how yall are able to ensure the clean process, as this product is made in North Korea? Correct me if I\u2019m wrong or missing details.\n\nAnyways!! I\u2019d say for the money, this is a good experimental product for those on the skin care journey. Just not for me.

When I first started using it I was implementing it in my daily routine (AM/PM), but at times that felt like too much. What I love about this product is that it's just a great staple to have in your repertoire, especially when you need to neutralize your skin and get it back to baseline. I've had dry skin my whole life, but due to hormonal changes (and stress) I started experiencing acne and having combo skin. I read that prebiotics are great for reducing breakouts (which this moisturizer has), and considering how expensive skincare can be, this product is great for its price point. You won't be disappointed by giving this one a try. I personally like to use it every other day, more so in the evening before bed since it is a little more hydrating than I'd like for under my makeup. I would consider repurchasing this in the future or trying their jelly cleanser of this collection, but overall it's a pretty neutral moisturizer.", "I like it but tbh, you have to apply it twice or else you'll have dry skin.

So what does that say for the tampons themselves?\n\nI do not know yet as I have yet to wear one. They are packaged individually in a nosey paper packaging. Not my favorite as its quite loud.\n\nFor these reasons I have rated it low.", "Not pleased. The applicator is plastic, I wish it was cardboard and better for the environment. It isn\u2019t easy to push in which means I need to help it, gross. And, it opens like a burrito coming apart at the seams and not like a flower blooming, so it\u2019s less preferable to me.", "Going to have to be a bit personal here. I could have sworn I was wearing a tampon but couldn't find the string. Long story short, somehow the string got very far up. If I hadn't physically looked for it and with difficulty got it out, I really would have thought I had taken it out previously. This is very dangerous. Avoid this product. It NOT worth it.", "These are not the same tampons they were selling as \"Amazon Brand\" through Solemo, or whatever it was. These are different, too long, too hard, string literally hurting you.", "These tampons work just fine and I I had no issues with them whatsoever.\nThe applicator was annoying. Personally I prefer plastic applicators. I know they are not as eco friendly, but I find them much more comfortable to use. I was happy to see these were a plastic applicator, however they were very difficult to plunge. Every single time I had to get the plunger started before attempting to insert. If not, I couldn\u2019t get it to go when I was in assumed position. I suppose I could have given it a big push, but I prefer a bit gentler approach when inserting.\nThe tampon itself was perfectly fine. No issues with comfort or leakage.\n\nI know the applicator issue is minor, but for the same price if not more expensive than other leading brands, I would probably grab a box of those over these. If those weren\u2019t available I would not have a problem using these. These are still good.", "These definitely need the applicator because they are very flexible but that also makes them comfortable to wear. They aren\u2019t as absorbent as I\u2019d hoped but they get the job done.", "I like that Amazon has been coming out with some of their own products. Many of them are pretty competitive, as far as the quality is concerned, with major name brands. The difference is that many of amazon's products are more affordable and are only a fraction of the price. This is my first time trying tampons from Amazon and I was curious to see how they would fair compared with the other brands I am used to using.\n\nAs far as the performance is concerned, the shining star of this package are the applicators, in my opinion. They are smooth and they glide in easily. They make it more comfortable to insert them with and they are not at all a hassle to use. They do not get stuck and they do not pinch.\n\nAll of these have a pretty good absorbency rate.\n\nI like the fact that this is a multiple sized package. It comes with light, regular and super.\n\nNow, the only reason I didn't give this a full 5 star rating is because I feel like each of these sizes are a little smaller compared to most of the other brands sizing. The light is really small, which is a good thing if you have a very light flow. The regular is a small in other brands and the super size, in my opinion is the equivalent of a regular in other brands. Just be aware of this ahead of time, especially if you have a more than average heavy flow.", "My wife asks me to get her tampons at the store...a lot. For some reason, whenever she realizes she needs them - she is at home and I'm out and about. So naturally this leads to a phone call or text \"Hey, since you are out, can you get...\" So that leads to the awkward scenario of a lone male purchasing tampons at the store.\n\nNow, this shouldn't be an uncomfortable scenario in 2022....but it still is. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThankfully I encountered these Amazon Basics tampons. I can just get them delivered. No more awkward in store buying. \ud83d\udc4d\n\nAdmittedly, she's picky and hesitant to try new brands. She uses the Pearl and Sport ones typically. However, she was fine with these. They are unscented, comfortable and generally check all the boxes for her. We save some money, they can be shipped...definitely a win \ud83d\udc4d", "The tampons are fantastic and in comparison to the leading brands they perform just as well if not better.\n\nHere is my issue and why I absolutely will likely not purchase these again. Plastic applicator with paper wrapper. I don\u2019t care for it. Here\u2019s why- I know a number of people who don\u2019t have waste baskets in their bathrooms so I typically have to take my applicator shove it back in the wrapper and discreetly place it back in my purse until I can get to a garbage can. The plastic applicator offers 0 absorbency so when placed back in the paper wrapper that then absorbs any residue and we\u2019re talking a mess if I have to put that back in my purse. Either that or I\u2019m wadding up toilet paper around it.\nI would have much rather a plastic applicator with a plastic wrapper or a cardboard with a paper wrapper. The reason I wouldn\u2019t have minded cardboard is because to a certain degree it offers a bit of absorbency and would do better in a paper wrapper.\nAlso, Not all bio-based plastics are biodegradable. Some bio-based plastics are recyclable though and I\u2019d really love to see information in the description to know if the applicator is either biodegradable or recyclable.", "These are pretty standard style traditional plastic applicator for standard absorbancy tampons (Light/Regular/Super). Fantastic that they're organic and not sure about earth-friendliness of the applicator (?biodegradable?)\n\nThe one thing I don't like about these is that the applicator does not operate smoothly. It is difficult to deploy the plunger (for lack of better terms) as it takes a lot of force to release the actual tampon. This is extremely annoying and may lead to ditching the applicator before even trying to use it. Not sure how no one else has had an issue. And sure, the wrapper can be a challenge to get the applicator back in for disposal as others have noticed.\n\nInterestingly the cotton tampon itself is longer than others. It expands in an \"S\" shape, rather than circular. Absorbancy is better than expected - seems like it is slightly better than the big name brands.\n\nThe price is slightly less than local options for organic tampons. Uncertain if it's worth the trouble with the applicator.", "I think multipacks of tampons are useful. This pack has 12 each of light, regular, and super. These tampons have plastic applicators and paper wrappers. They seem smaller than other brands at the same absorbency levels, which is fine if your flow is lighter. They work okay and are competitively priced. I would not replace my usual brand with these, but they are fine to use in a pinch.", "These are good tampons but I struggle with the price for \"organic\". If you're into that then these are fantastic, if not you can save your money and purchase the non-organic options. Either way, they do exactly what they are supposed to do to get the job done.", "Smart idea to offer unscented organic cotton tampons, who wouldn\u2019t want that? But is it wise to offer these individually wrapped, each with its own applicator to dispose of? The product info states that the applicator is bio based.The term 'bio-based' means that the material or product is at least partly derived from biomass (plants). It doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they are fully biodegradable though. However most won\u2019t argue that they are a better alternative than using plastic made from fossil fuels. But why not ditch the applicator altogether if you really want to save the planet? These tampons are fine, no better or worse than the leading brand.", "So I ordered these to try out and then found out I was pregnant before I had a chance to actually try them, but I wanted to share some thoughts about the product itself.\nFirst I feel like variety packs are great, but I think having more of the regular and less of the light and super would make more sense in a variety pack. I opened one up to check it out and noticed that the packaging doesn\u2019t come open very nicely. It kind of shreds. I usually put the applicator back in the packaging to dispose of it but I wouldn\u2019t be able to do that with these.\nThe applicator itself feels nice and like it would be easy to use and glide. The tampon itself seems really cheap though. It opens up to a super flat little piece of what feels like toilet paper wrapped around som cotton. I just don\u2019t really see that catching much other than what it comes directly in contact with. I did notice the string is sewn in so that\u2019s definitely a good thing.\nOverall I\u2019m pretty unimpressed with these tampons and their quality. Definitely nothing like what I\u2019m used to from the more name brands. When I finally get a chance to use them in like 1.5 years and they somehow change my mind, I will come back and update."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B092N8LH4Y", "title": "Hairgum Beard Styling Wax and Hair Pomade - Mens Classic Organic Hair Wax - Natural Hair Styling Wax with Easy Style - Firm Hold Hair Pomade for All Hair Type - High Shine Hair Wax Lasts All Day Long", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/IMAGERENDERING_521856-T1/images/I/7122y6u8ImL._SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "5 ratings", "description": "Hairgum Beard Styling Wax and hair pomade contain natural oils that provide hair protection.

I will need to continue the regimen and update my review on if it was as effective as the advertising says it is.\n\nThe instructions mention using a glide technique on larger areas and stamp technique for harder to reach/smaller areas like knees, underarms, etc. I found the glide technique was not super easy to do as in order to get the correct signal light for operation the device has to be flush to the skin and the actual \"gliding\" motion was not very smooth so I had to pick up the device to move it most of the time, meaning I did not have the \"go\" signal light. I found stamping much easier to do mechanically, although it was also harder to keep track of which areas I had done that way, since there is no visible change to the skin, and the instructions say to look away from the light for eye safety. The treatment window is quite small on the device so it will take a lot of \"stamps\" to do all of my legs, arms and chin once a week for the recommended initial 12 weeks (instructions say to use once a month after that for maintenance), but it will be worth it if it works.\n\nI occasionally felt a warmth, but never any pain and usually just felt nothing at all. I have sensitive skin so I was concerned about visual side effects/redness or a feeling of burning but there was none whatsoever. I used the device on legs, arms, and chin and after the one use I see no discernible hair reduction but I wasn't expecting any after one use either. I am looking forward to seeing what more treatments does and will update my review accordingly.", "Although this IPL machine is less powerful than some other ones in the market, I trust the brand to be safer. It is also FDA approved, some other brands claimed they were FDA approved but I was not able to find their documents on the FDA website and some who put a certification or approval reference, were not to their brand but to another brand that uses same technology.\n\nSince the power of this machine is not too high, it is safer to use even in sensitive areas like the lip. You feel the warmth when you use the machine, some other machines you feel stinging sensation because of the difference in power. This machine also works for a larger range of skin tone/hair color than other machines. Time will tell how effective the treatments will be.\n\nContrary to other machines, this machine could be used without sunglasses, probably because it is not as powerful.\n\nI like and recommend this machine especially for safety reasons.", "If you\u2019re looking for a brand name, FDA approved hair removal device\u2014-look no further! Braun is a well known and trusted name for all your hair care needs. This device is painless. No more cutting yourself in the shower! I don\u2019t miss that!\n\nThey recommend regular treatments for a duration of 12 weeks. I saw a reduction in hair growth right away. Your personal use/hair type and results might differ. Although the stated lamp life is 300,000 flashes\u2014not as high as some models, I might add.\n\nThe packaging is professional and includes a chart on the side. It would also make a great gift! The kit itself includes a soft pink carrying bag and Venus brand razor.\n\nI took off a star because, in my personal opinion, this model is overpriced for what you get and lacks certain features. Depending on what you\u2019re looking for in a hair removal device that could be a plus or negative. Also, I find the girly pink color and pink bag a little annoying/targeted. Not all women \u201clike pink\u201d and YES IPL hair removal is for guys, too!!\n\nI recommend using this with sunglasses and keeping an ice pack handy in case your skin gets hot/uncomfortable. Also, be sure your pet or little one isn\u2019t nearby so the flashes won\u2019t damage their eyes!", "Braun IPL Hiar remover for women and men. I had been wanting to try out one of these IPL hair removers for a while now but didn't until I saw that Braun had some on the market that are FDA approved. Braun is a very trusted name, so when I saw this, I ordered it immediately. I followed the instructions, and you are supposed to shave first before using this device as it targets the root of the hair follicle that's why they include a razor. If you are using on your face, you should first use a facial epilator beforehand. The IPL should be used once a week for the first 4 to 12 weeks then you use it once every 1 to 2 months after to maintain. I haven't been using it for long enough to notice any permanent hair reduction, but my hair is taking longer to grow back, and the hair is thinner than before so i do believe it is working. This device is more expensive than other on the market but it's Braun's least expensive model. This does say it will last through 300,000 flashes which is equivalent to 16 years. I do think this should have come with protective eyewear and I do recommend wearing sunglasses while using this. Overall, I'm happy with the results so far and will continue to use and would recommend.", "This IPL device does work, but it's not great for the price, you're mostly paying for the brand name.\n\nThe automatic adjustment system is by far its most impressive feature but it isn't all that useful all things considered, it's just preventing you having to work out the device's ideal light for your skin and hair type, and if that's what you're paying extra for, beyond the brand name, it's not terribly worth it.\n\nThe actual flash output isn't as strong as I've seen, it's also a very standard speed. The device claims 300,000 flashes, but this stat is I think somewhat meaningless, you don't use an enormous amount per session and it's impossible to really hold the companies accountable for the number, especially on these devices without a flash counter.\n\nFurther, the device is one of those awkward ovoid ones. The gun shaped or more long, slender form ones are much easier to use, this one is always a struggle to figure out exactly how to hold it in regards to certain parts of the body. This is reduced a little with its all of its automatic features but frankly, a better form factor would be better.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with this IPL but the only reason I would recommend this over cheaper alternatives is if you just really want to have a recognizable branding on it. It'll do the job, it may take longer than some and it may not be as easy to use as some, but it isn't like it's a fake product.", "This is my first IPL that I've ever used, so I'm still getting used to it and how it works. I had a little trouble getting it to work at first, but that was completely user error. I also accidentally looked at it a couple times, not a good idea. It's definitely very bright and the next time I'll definitely be wearing sunglasses or something to get protect my eyes. I kept accidentally looking at it cuz I was trying to watch where it was going. I'm trying this on my legs, armpits, and face to give it a good test. It does say visible results in up to 12 weeks, so I'm in it for the long haul if it means less shaving.\nI did feel a little heat with each flash, but it was quick and painless.", "This seems to be pretty good quality, which is not surprising coming from a name like Braun. It is very reasonably priced compared to a lot of other ones out there, and it seems to work just as good or better than most, though time will tell. It doesn't hurt and it's easy to use and hold. I like that it's FDA cleared, but the only downside for me is that it has a limit of 300,000 flashes.. I do see how that could last 16 years, but if you're sharing this with more in your household, it would be nice to get more flashes out of it.\n\nWould also be nice to have more features to get to a narrow space or even to cool the skin like some other high end ones have. Though, for the price and for being the \"mini\" version, this is pretty good.", "It's actually lighter than I expected and not too difficult to use. I wouldn't recommend this for doing anything on the backside, which I found to have more trouble when using this. The razor does a pretty good job with short hair and is good on sensitive skin, just like the IPL device itself. I was able to use the highest setting without succumbing to irritation or burns.", "This Braun IPL Hair Removal Tool is easy to hold and use. It's smaller and more compact than other ones, I've tried before. I really like the look of this one. I definitely like the colors! I also like that it comes with a Venus Smooth Razor and a little, pink pouch to carry it all in. I can bring it with me on trips and it doesn't take up much space.\n\nI've been using it on my legs. It only takes 10 minutes to do a treatment. I can tell a difference, in the time I've been using it. I'll have to keep using it for more results but so far, so good!", "This review is for a Braun IPL, Alternative to Laser Hair Removal. This is something new to me. This device is not rechargeable and must be plugged into a wall outlet.\nThe product page says that the device should last up to 16 years. Treated hair should start to be visibly reduced in 3 months. The device is pressed against the skin and moved as the light flashes. You start by using this for once a week for 4 - 12 weeks, then hair falls out and grows back slower. Lastly continue to use every month or two for maintenance. I am using this on my underarms. I know this will take awhile and am willing to commit to the usage, if it means I won't have to shave as often.", "Review for: Braun IPL, Alternative to Laser Hair Removal for Women and Men, Silk Expert Mini PL1014 with Venus Razor, FDA Cleared, Permanent Reduction in Hair Regrowth for Body & Face, Corded (Packaging May Vary)\n\nAfter the hoards of generic IPL devices, it's interesting to see a name brand try it. As expected, you're paying for their name brand upwards of $50-100.\n\nPros\n=not that it matters but branded Venus Razor.\n\nCons\n=Overpriced\n=only 300k flashes for $200 while even the cheap ones now offer 1M\n=not in gun-shaped which is easier to hold\n=No LCD for $200! All of the other ones come with LCDS\n=No safety glasses included\n=no cooling functionality\n\nCan't especially recommend this one.", "I received Braun IPL Hair Removal for Women and Men, Silk Expert Mini PL1014 with Venus Razor, FDA Cleared, Permanent Reduction in Hair Regrowth for Body & Face, Corded to test out.\nLet me preface by saying I have never used an IPL before and was quite nervous to try it out, especially given all the guidelines and warnings in the user manual.\nMy number one concern was pain, I was very hesitant to use for fear that the process would feel like burning. I was pleased to find that it is not painful whatsoever. My skin did feel warmth but not to an uncomfortable point.\nMy other concern was ease of use. I have been shaving my legs since I was 14 years old and despite it being inconvenient, it is still easy to do. The manual is extensive to say the least, as it should be. However once you can check all the boxes off and make sure that this product is right for your skin type and area of use, it's relatively easy to get started. The entire process took me less than 10 minutes to start.\nI am impressed with the results so far, I do see a change in hair growth.\nThe price is a little steep compared to other IPL's on the market, still cheaper than paying for professional laser hair removal.", "I can\u2019t recommend this IPL device enough. It\u2019s so easy to use and is definitely the most beginner friendly device I\u2019ve found. While the price isn\u2019t the cheapest, it is worth the cost as it doesn\u2019t require any adjustments and the device basically does everything for you except for pressing the button.\n\nI felt no pain, more of a warming/heat sensation while using this, but of course, everyone is a little different.\n\nThe included razor is pointless, but hey, why not? Can\u2019t say no to a free razor, right?\n\nThe only complaint I have is that the device is a one time use. Meaning, the flash head cannot be replaced, so when it goes, you have to buy a whole new unit, but considering the rates lifespan, this should be fine, unless you\u2019re trying to use one device for multiple people.", " I have to say I was super intimidated by this product right out of the gate because of all the warnings in the manual. DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT, DO NOT. But you really need to read everything thoroughly before you use this product to make sure you're being safe and also to make sure it works for you.\n\nI wanted to start with my armpits because it's a smaller area and doesn't get direct sunlight. I live in FL and the manual says not to use if you have recently tanned, so you have to wait like 7 days. But my skin is constantly tan, soooo. Anyway, you have to remove the hair from the skin completely first and then clean any chemicals/products from the area (aka, take off the deodorant).\n\nI turned the machine on and the power button flickered immediately. You press the power button once and you'll hear the sound of a fan, which will tell you the machine is ready to use. When you put the machine up to the body part, the power button will change to a different color, indicating that the machine is good to use in that spot. The manual will tell you what the colors mean, but basically pink is good to go and red means no. The machine will not flash if the light is red. You're not supposed to look at the light when it flashes, so I positioned it where I wanted it and then closed my eyes and pressed the button. It does have a slight sting, but nothing crazy and it lasts for half a second. Basically like whoa, what the heck was that and it's over. Then you move it to the next area of your underarm. I also did the top part of my feet.\n\nThe manual didn't mention anything about if I can use deodorant after treatment and I did put some on, so hopefully that is okay.\n\nYou are only supposed to use it once a week for 12 weeks, so I wrote myself reminders in my planner to make sure I'm doing the treatment consistently.", " Braun IPL Silk Expert Mini PL1014\n\nThis IPL hair removal system was very easy-to-use after reading all the enclosed information and then playing with it for a little while. Make sure your skin and hair color will work with this type of technology, a few will not.\n\nHere are a few things that stood out to me:\n\nPros:\n\n\u00b7 This is giftable because the presentation is striking. When you open the black box all you see is the pink and white device, it\u2019s visually appealing.\n\u00b7 Braun is a well-known brand that has been around for a long time.\n\u00b7 The length of the cord is generous: 10 feet. This is important because you\u2019re limited to where you can use the device by the length of the cord to an outlet.\n\u00b7 A razor is included.\n\u00b7 A very nice pink drawstring bag is included and the unit, the cords, and the instruction manual all fit into the bag. No need to keep the box. I like that.\n\u00b7 It\u2019s really plug and play. Just turn it on by pressing the one big button on top of the unit. The short video shows what the device looks like after turning it on (the \u201cpower indicator\u201d blinks). The \u201cpower indicator\u201d is the ring around the large button that lights up. There are no manual adjustments. The machine decides which of three working intensities to use based on skin color. The power indicator is pink for fair skin (that\u2019s what I assume I experienced - there weren\u2019t any color depictions in the manual), light pink for medium intensity/medium tone skin, and white for low intensity/dark skin tones. Red means the unit isn\u2019t positioned correctly and it will stop flashing/working.\n\u00b7 The \u201cgliding mode\u201d is the automatic mode. It worked quickly; there was just enough time to move the device to the next patch of skin and the device would flash. This was the best experience for me as you only have to move the unit along your skin.\n\u00b7 You can \u201cstamp\u201d one patch at a time for difficult to reach areas where you might need a little bit of time to position the device.\n\u00b7 This oval-shaped device is moderately sized and felt comfortable in my hand.\n\u00b7 My skin felt warm at times, but I was never uncomfortable.\n\u00b7 The device did not feel warm once I was finished using it. I was able to place it immediately into the bag.\n\u00b7 1 year warranty.\n\nCons:\n\n\u00b7 No LCD display window. (But there aren\u2019t any extra features, like a flash counter or cooling mode, where this would be necessary).\n\u00b7 No sunglasses are provided. The instructions simply tell you to look away, which can be difficult if you want to see where the device is/where you are going. Wear your sunnies.\n\u00b7 No manual adjustments may be made. The device will decide the intensity level based on your skin color and you can\u2019t change anything.\n\u00b7 To enter \u201cgliding\u201d (automatic) mode you have to continually press the big button. It wasn\u2019t an issue for me to just keep me finger positioned on the button, but for some people that might be difficult/tiring.\n\u00b7 It took me just about my entire first session to figure out how to stop the \u201cpower indicator\u201d from frequently turning red. If the unit isn\u2019t fully in contact with skin it will not work. TIP: I found that placing the device lengthwise along my leg (vertically) instead of horizontally, which was my intuitive placement, made a huge difference. However, knees and ankles were still difficult to place the unit correctly so the machine wouldn\u2019t turn red.\n\nThe enclosed information recommends you use the unit once a week for 12 weeks and then once a month or as needed. Be patient. It will take some time to see results.\n\nBottom line. This is a nice-looking IPL hair removal system if you want a plug and play model with no extra features like a flash counter or cooling. The longer cord length was appreciated. It\u2019s from a well-known brand that has been around for a while, but the higher price reflects that. Lesser known / unknown brands are available for less money with more features. This device is made in the U.K. The pink pouch is made in China.", "The maximum result on this gadget is 4 J/cm2. The maximum result on Braun's most costly IPL is 6 J/cm2. Strangely, the lighter the complexion the higher the result. On my upper legs which see no daylight, the circle around the middle button illuminated pink, meaning it would streak the maximum result. On my lower arms which are really tan, the circle around the middle button illuminated light pink and periodically white, meaning not as strong. It's functioning rapidly on my beard! Happy I didn't need to pay for 7 meetings of laser hair evacuation! Concerning thicker hair, it's certainly taking some time. The main disadvantage is that it has a sensor to streak the light, and in some cases, the sensor will not permit light to blaze, and I'd need to continue to attempt to streak one region. I'm utilizing this on my underarms. I realize this will take for some time and will focus on the use, on the off chance that it implies I will not need to shave as frequently.", "Very happy with this laser hair remover. I've tried a few and I'm really liking this one. It's super easy to use and compact. Smaller than other ones. Love that it won't let you zap it in the same place. When light is red even if you press it it won't work, when it's pink your able to zap it and it will work. Only thing is it didn't come with glasses like other brands & red light is pretty bright."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B8VC5C2", "title": "CAVU Nutrition Gentle Prebiotic Fiber Supplement | Promotes Comfortable Digestion & Regularity* | Intestinal & Colon Health* | Weight Management* (30 Servings)", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Fy7VPBGuL.__AC_SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg", "ratings": "111 ratings", "description": "CAVU Nutrition Gentle Prebiotic Fiber Supplement | Promotes Comfortable Digestion & Regularity* | Intestinal & Colon Health* | Weight Management* (30 Servings)", "reviews": ["I\u2019m middle aged and my digestive system ain\u2019t what it used to be.\nI struggled with acid reflux and thankfully I got it under control by drastically changing my diet.

I wanted to try their laundry detergent... BUT Puracy can't package their product correctly, and it spills all over as they just throw it in a box and call it good.

I was going to purchase a Babybliss on the last Prime day but they had been sold out before I got a chance to get one. I bought this instead for less than half the price and have been pleasantly surprised with it! Very close shave, I've found that using it in the shower provides the smoothest shave on my head. It is definitely water proof. A little tricky to clean but you get used to it, I've got to clean it every 3 or 4 shaves. I've tried a few of the included attachments and they are mediocre at best but the 7D head is legit!

I haven't allowed for growth of more than a couple days, so may have to use an attachment to get it lower before shaving. (Having the attachments is a great bonus over a previous hand held razor I had.) and clean up of the razor is very easy. I'm only 6 weeks in of use, but very happy with purchase.", "I have been using a different style headshaver for a couple of years now, but it left a lot of stubble. I have tried others that look like this, and was very disappointed, it's like they didn't have blades inside!! I took a chance after doing a lot of research online, and reading the reviews. I tried this one and my head is completely smooth!!! Very easy and fast to use with water or just a dry shave with absolutely no irritation!!! It is very easy to clean after following the directions, I've turned my brother on to on of these too, and he loves it!!! Highly recommended!!! (finally) I love it!!!", "Versatility describes this product perfectly. The short hair (shaver) works great and with the trimmer adapter, it makes it easy to keep your hair looking great all in the convenience of your own residence. If you're tired of having to slog down to the barber, (like I've been for years), but want a nice-looking head of hair, this is the way to get it done. The kit even comes with a nice cutting cape, so you don't get covered in hair, making cleanup a breeze.\n\nI was given this as a gift and I absolutely love it. The battery lasts a long time on a charge and I would highly recommend it to all my friends.", "I bought this product for my husband. He shaves his own head if he cannot get to the hairdresser. He use to always miss spots and I was so embarrassed b/c I never noticed until we were out in public. I bought him this head shaver about 4 months ago. It is amazing. He has not missed a spot since I bought this for him. I love it and he loves it too. He uses it all of the time and has not had to recharge the battery yet. He says that it is easy to clean and easy to hold in your hand. If you have a husband that shaves his head himself, you have to get this for him.", "The razor does the job pretty well.

I love the concept, the convenience. It lasted me for a year. During that time the clipper covers broke one by one and the battery life sucked all to be d@mned. It finally died on me a few months ago. I had to reup, bigger and better the next time. So i decided to buy a 50 dollar one; and man its great. Just used it before writing this and it got me geeked to do a review. Had a few inches of hair on my head and it cleaned it right up.

Battery is on the weak side, needs to be charged after each use.", "I almost never write reviews, but I spent a mint on this and felt like it was worth giving some feedback.\n\nThis product is incredible. It's been almost 10 years since the universe took my hair, and I finally feel like it's been made up to me. I've tried all manner of shaver. Spent way more than the $$ this cost trying to find a good mid-priced one, but months of 'Rona isolation have driven me to the brink of madness and I finally bit the bullet and spent the cash on something nice.\n\nGlad I picked this one.\nThis shaver just looks and feels like a quality product. The accompanying cleaning stand feels high quality too, and you can feel good displaying this in your bathroom. You know. If you're the type of dude (or dudette) who worries about commode aesthetics.\n\nSo then I go to use it. Click on. Shave. Click off. Simple. Clean. I like that.\n\nAnd guess what else was simple? The whole shaving process. This cuts my shaving time down from 15-20m to under 5. Boom. Click on. 5m. Done. And my head has never been so buttery smooth. A couple passes over the ol' noggin, and you've got a silky smooth shave better than anything short of a straight razor. And those have never been viable for me since my hands shake like I'm in the back seat of a dune buggy on a gravel road during an earthquake.\n\nAt the end of the day, that's what this whole review boils down to. The shave is incredible. Plus, I've always struggled to get a good shave day-to-day; 1-2 days it's too short and I miss hairs but longer than 3 and it gloms up my razor and turns into a whole fiasco. So since I don't have the discipline to reliably hit that tiny window, my look cycles between \"clean-cut professional\" and \"5 days of patchy Brillo Pad-like growth a la Carrot Top after a cooking accident\" and I HATE that inconsistency. But this product makes it quick and easy to keep my head looking clean every single day. If only I could still leave my house.\n\nSo to wrap this all up, I highly recommend this product.", "I am so very much impressed with this shaver. I bought the \"Pitbull Silver Shaver\" about 2 years or so ago and I thought that it was very good. But this shaver is the absolute best, and it is very very easy to clean. Just pop open the shaver heads and rinse. It shaves closer than the Pitbull Shaver and is easier to clean. I just love it!! I love everything about it except that it will not jump on my head by itself and start shaving me. I have to use my own hand.", "Been shaving my head for 20 years and this is the best product I've ever used. So much easier than normal clippers. Also found it funny that they include a barber shop style apron with it... For a product for bald guys ha", "This is the third head shaver I have purchased on Amazon. The previous ones were not as powerful as I would have liked and the blades dulled quickly (I won't disclose the brand of the previous two, but they were orange in color). This shaver is by far the best of the three. Its seven shaving heads give you a close, smooth, and fast shave. It's good for both your head and face! The battery life is phenomenal. I have been using this shaver for three months and, shaving my head and face, have never drained the battery below 94%. It even has a feature that shows you when the unit needs to be cleaned! Cleaning is very easy. I was concerned by some reviews that claim otherwise, but those guys must not have finger nails! The six peripheral heads open easily, and then the center heads comes of with a slight counter clockwise twist. No problem whatsoever! The shaver itself fits comfortably in your hand. If you travel, do yourself a favor and buy the available hard case. You won't go wrong by buying this shaver!", "I do like the shave it does bog down during wet shaves and don\u2019t open the blades to clean parts fell out and I had to reassemble!", "My husband says he really likes it.

But when it went bad, I decided to buy a new shaver.\n\nI will tell you something. The first time I ever used this I was literally blown away. It was smooth, gave a perfect shave, and I literally said \"wow\" out loud. I know it sounds like an exaggeration, but it's not. Highly recommended.", "This product works great. The battery life, the ability to clean it and ease of hold are all excellent. The only con I would make note of is to \"not\" submerge this electronic product in water, including the shower or running water directly over it. I paid the price in having it go bad which lead to a re-order. If the blades need to be clean, simply detach it from the base and wash it out.", "Losing the hair battle so decided to go bald. For a great lightning deal on Amazon it was absolutely worth the purchase. Easy to use out of the box. The ergonomics of it in your hand felt great just add a little finger pressure to the shave pad for good shave.

Also works decent for quick beard shave in the field for army.", "I wanted to shave my head to start a new look as well as keeping myself nice and trimmed.\n\nI've never bought a shaver like this before so I was pleasantly surprised by how nice and smooth this product was.

I'll buy it again.", "Great replacement. Was using some other all natural shampoo and this is way better for my hair and less packaging. Had to wait a while for it to arrive. Worth it. I use cheap supermarket conditioner with honey and probably silicone. This shampoo leaves our fam hair very soft compared to the expensive kind of shampoo we used before.", "I've used this product for a few years now. I am very satisfied with the products and what it does for my hair.", "OK I'll say it -- I have gorgeous hair. Sorry, but it's true and I've been told this my whole life. With that out of the way, I highly recommend this shampoo. It's a nontrivial task to find products that work for your hair, and I've spent frustrating years trying to do just that. I had a product I loved but they changed the formula a few years ago, then I was using organic baby products but they kept going out of stock, the price fluctuated wildly, and I received several bottles that were rancid and had exploded in transit. I even tried a friend's silicone-filled normal shampoo/conditioner for a week while I visited her and wow was that a mistake. Enter Puracy. A friend had their dish soap and said I should look them up on Amazon so I did. My pic is all the Puracy products I now use minus the Laundry Stain Spray, which I forgot but is AWESOME and actually works.\n\nI originally bought the shampoo/conditioner bottle pack to try it. I went through both bottles so I bought both refill bags. The scent has really grown on me and I think it has improved with the big refill bags. I like that I can reuse the bottle and pump and not throw away a pump every time.\n\nThis shampoo is great and the ingredients are awesome. It suds up so nicely and my hair feels super clean and soft afterwards. You should follow it with the conditioner, which is the best conditioner I've ever used. My hair is quite long and luxurious, and both the shampoo and conditioner pamper it very well. You should absolutely try this, but maybe start with the 2-pack of shampoo/conditioner bottles to see if you like it. I think you will, then you'll have bottles you can refill with the big refill bags!\n\nI have interacted with this company several times and their customer service is absolutely exceptional. But I bought all of the products you see in my pic for full price because I wanted them, that's it. I'm an actual, normal person who likes writing reviews on Amazon. And I highly recommend all the products you see in my pic -- especially the vanilla/lavender foaming handsoap, the bathroom spray, oh and the laundry stain spray! I forgot that in the pic. The lavender/grapefruit baby lotion is good too, try this stuff!", "I like Puracy products and I will counting to buy them. The packaging was the only bad thing because it didn\u2019t hold up and leaked all inside the box.", "I need to start by saying my hair is long, thick, dry and coarse (naturally a dark ash blonde). Nothing has ever made it smooth or soft. That being said, i've ordered both the shampoo and conditioner.\nMy husband has fine hair, and its given it so much more lift. He was previoisly using suave daily clarifying shampoo and its made an incredible difference.\nMy hair is no drier/frizzy than it ever was using garnier sleek & shine, aussie 3 minute miracle deep conditioner, or a coconut cream deep conditioner i got as part of a promotion from Sally's Beauty supplies. I wash my hair once a week and until a year ago dyed it purple/teal/blue every 8 weeks for a couple years. This appears to be very safe on color treated hair! I've been using this for about 6 months and the color is very much still there (more mermaid hair than universe hair at this point) and very little washes out compared to drug store shampoos.\nEven with the conditioner my hair is on the drier side, this has been my whole life! It is softer though. I started making my own leave-in conditioner (coconut oil, avocado oil, castor oil, almond oil, sandalwood essential oil) and its most effective/requires the least amount when i use puracy shampoo/conditioner. The picture is my hair the day after washing with minimal leave in conditioner added.\nMy scalp doesn't itch as much, the dryness i was getting is gone, i'm not seeing as much hair going down the drain, its been easier to style, hair appears stronger, smells amazing, will keep ordering! I have to use a lot at once given the amount of hair i have, but for as frequently as i wash it that isn't an issue.", "It was suggested to me that I try a sulfate free shampoo, as it could be better for my complexion and my hair. The friend who suggested this to me also mentioned that there may be a period where my hair feels greasy, since the body has to readjust itself to the lessened demand (as sulfates strip the natural oils from your hair). So, after doing some research and going into my purchase with some expectation I will have to say that after a week of use, I am impressed.\n\nPerhaps, because my friend has very long hair, she had a longer time to readjust, or perhaps it has to do with a difference in brand, but within a day or two my hair felt fine. Admittedly, the first two days my hair felt heavier (if that makes sense), but I didn't feel gross. Beyond that initial adjustment, my hair does feel much better, I think it even feels a bit thicker than before and I don't feel as though my forehead is drying out as much as it used to. I'm not trying to tote this about as a miracle cure, but so far I have been happy with my purchase and would recommend it. The smell is refreshing and crisp, but not overpowering. One thing I had not expected was that the shampoo does not foam up into a rich lather as the mass produced stuff does, so it will take a little bit more effort on your part to rub the product into your hair, but I don't think this takes away from the product. I'm hoping for long term satisfaction with the product, and I hesitate to write a review on a product I intend to use for a long while after only a week's use, but so far, so good.\n\nUpdate: Second time purchased (I suppose someone with longer hair might go through the two bottles more rapidly). I was thoroughly pleased that the two bottles lasted me a year (I am not finished with the second bottle, but wanted to replenish my stock to avoid running out). For that, the price was definitely worth it. But much more than quantity of product, I can say that my hair feels smoother, less frizzy, and overall just seems healthier. I no longer need conditioner, and I found that lathering isn't as much of a problem as it was when I first started using the product. I would recommend this product to anyone, hands down.", "I am tentatively giving this 5 stars. If I am not happy with it in a month or so, I will come back and update my review.\n\nBack about February (it is now the end of July), my hairdresser reminded me that our hair appreciates a change in shampoo now and then. I had been using  Avalon Organics Shampoo, Nourishing Lavender, 32 Fluid Ounce  for a long time, and my hair did feel weighted down. I live in a small city with only Walmart, Rite-Aid and Walgreens for options in shopping for personal care products, so of course I always turn to Amazon first. My search didn't turn up very many affordable options in organic hair care. After a long search, I ordered  Tea Tree Oil Hair Shampoo, Sulfate Free with 5% Tea Tree Essential Oil, Deep Cleansing for Dandruff, Dry Scalp and Itchy Hair, for Men & Women- 16 fl oz  because my scalp was often itchy. This was a HUGE mistake! That Tea Tree shampoo actually burned my scalp and ears! I returned it for a full refund (no problem) and the search continued for a good shampoo. Every few years, I break out with some eczema on my hands. After using the Tea Tree Shampoo, eczema broke out on my neck for the first time ever.\n\nNext I tried  Gentle Restorative Shampoo (16 oz) Eczema, Psoriasis, Seborrhea, Dermatitis, Dandruff, Itchy Scalp Dry Scalp Treatment - Natural Organic Ingredients, Manuka Honey & Aloe Vera by Honeyskin Organics  because at that time my scalp was still hurting, burning, itching. This shampoo seemed very mild. My hair seemed to like it but my scalp was still suffering. Honeyskin Shampoo is expensive and I often needed to lather twice with this one. I wondered; is there a better shampoo out there for me?\n\nThen I discovered Puracy Natural Daily Shampoo. It seems gentle and mild. One lather does it. My hair is soft and happy. My natural waves/curls/body (virgin hair that my hairdresser loves) are not weighted down. My scalp feels good! The price is right. I have only used it a few times so far, but I think this will work. Until my hairdresser reminds me that our hair likes a change now and then....", "Tried this to use in shampoo dispenser to reduce my plastic bottle waste. This container is recyclable type 7, which cannot go in my local recycling. Still searching.\nOtherwise the smell is great and my hair does well.", "This is a great shampoo, but it does take some getting used to. At first, your hair won't feel the same as you're used to with a commercial hair product. For the first 2 weeks of use every other day, the shampoo didn't want to lather too much and I felt like I had to use a lot more of it than I am used to. I also had to section my hair in 3rds, working from the front to the nape of my neck because it didn't lather. My hair felt heavier as I rinsed it, as if I had only used conditioner and not shampoo. It didn't dry on it's own well either; it didn't feel \"nice\" unless I used a blow drier.\n\nFast foward past what I call the \"DETOX\" period and my hair is AMAZING! I can't say for certain, but I would bet that the first 2 weeks of blah-ness was actually the shampoo stripping away years and years of nasty product buildup. Before, my hair was coarse and dry and while it felt \"soft\" it really wasn't soft naturally. I have always struggled with oil production and cannot shampoo more than every other day otherwise my hair would feel stripped of all moisture. My husband never really cared to cuddle with me either because the new little hairs (new hair growth) were always so stiff they would poke him in the face and felt \"prickly\". I had a prickly head! But not anymore!\n\nNow, my hair is beautifully soft and manageable with a shine to it that I've never had before. In the shower, I have LOTS of lather going on and while I'm still sectioning my hair in 3rds to make sure that it can get to my scalp and clean, that's now just habit more than anything. It has a great smell too, not overpowering, and very refreshing. What's best is knowing that I'm not exposing myself to harmful chemicals, parabens, pthalates, and NO ANIMAL TESTING!\n\nMy husband is LOVING it too, and is enjoying cuddling with me for the first time ever! I have never needed conditioner b/c I produce enough of my own oils, but I'm certain it would work just as well. We also use Puracy dish soap (awesome!) and hand soap (equally as awesome!) as well as their laundry detergent. THANK YOU PURACY! I'm a customer for life!", "Guys guys guys, you need to listen to me. This company is the best!!!\n\nIt is one of those family owned companies that are honest and makes great products. Not the mention, their customer service is 15/10 stars.\n\nI've discovered this brand a few years ago and was immediately hooked. Their entire lineups are all natural and they are phenomenal.\n\nI started with their soap lines, as I have sensitive skin and need soaps that wont strip off any more of my natural oil on my skin. I decided to give their Shampoo and try and I never looked back.\n\nI naturally have very oily hair and it becomes very oily within 15-24 hours. HOWEVER, I noticed that after consistent use of this shampoo, I noticed that my hair was going a full 2 days without having to look like I dipped my hair in oil. IDK what magic this is but it was awesome. On top of that, the scent is incredible.\n\nIt might appear a bit more expensive, but I can vouch for this brand.\n\nFrom the little things like supporting local artists with their packaging art to using all natural ingredients for their product, this brand is a winner.\n\nThey've been slowly growing and getting their products on amazon and Target now, so I am very happy to see that their products are gaining popularity!!! I've been recommending all my friends about this brand. Must buy!", "Final update- changed my rating from 1 to 4!\nI received their updated product and I couldn't wait to see what improvements are made to this shampoo.\nI immediately felt the changes in the way it creates foam and moisture.\nWith the normal number of pumps, i got lots of foams that washed my hair appropriately. I also noticed that my hair was not as rough. Of course, my hair needs conditioner followed by shampoo but this is no different any shampoo i've used before so it's satisfactory.\nAnd interestingly, my hair no longer smells! I know the scent didn't change but something was done to maintain my hair smelling fine throughout the day. I am once again a satisfied customer! I'm glad they contacted me to try their updated product.\n\nUpdate - I received an email right after this review about how they addressed some of the issues i mentioned. I am impressed how the company is taking customer feedback seriously and how quickly they respond! They offered to send me another set of shampoo with the improvements and I will update this after using them.\n\n---- Original review ----\nI've recently switched to use sulfate free shampoo. Since I was so happy with their hand soap, I gave this a try and I hate it.\nI have full of hair and on the oily side. I have to wash my hair everyday; otherwise my hair would smell and get super oily. This product:\n- It says it will make luxurious foam but I don't seem to get that. so I use extra pump to make sure I have enough foam to wash my hair\n- It says it increases moisture but my hair feels super rough after this shampoo. I have to use a ton of conditioner to compensate it.\n- It doesn't smell good after I wash my hair with this. I keep sniffing my hair throughout the day because I feel like my hair smells as if I did not wash them!\nAll these probably has something to do with my water and my hair type but I can't wait to finish these bottles so that I can use other shampoo..", "This shampoo has a lovely refreshing scent. My hair feels very squeaky clean. No build up.", "I have been using this product for my kids for at least 5 years now. I love the fresh smell and how clean the product is with no harsh chemicals.

Emailed the company to see if they can send us some. We used to get one pump per set and now there are none.", "This is the BEST company. I just found them on Amazon and am SOLD. I have used the shampoo, conditioner, body wash AND lotion, and I will never use another ever again. The scent is good, and it makes my hair look and feel amazing! I like to make as little of a footprint as possible, so I purchased the big bag instead of a bottle. It was scary buying something with so many ounces, especially since this is the first time I heard of this company. But I will never buy another companies product ever again. They met and exceeded my standards. I would recommend their line to anyone, especially those who are trying to use organic, products, those with sensitive skin, and just anyone who wants a refreshing shampoo. Plus, the colors and designs and scents the company uses are great!", "I bought this because it is considered clear of harsh fragrance and chemicals as well as being low in plastic waste. It smells fantastic but it takes 3 washes to get my mid length hair clean versed one wash from a more traditional shampoo. The extra shampoo needed defeated the propose of buying this to reduce plastic waste as I would need to buy it much more frequently, not to mention the time and water wasted."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09GV2JWHP", "title": "Pantene Shampoo, Conditioner and Hair Treatment Set, Healthy Lengths", "price": "1 option from\n$7.97", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71ePvzDmJQL._SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "834 ratings", "description": "HARD WORKING, LONG LASTING Your haircare should work as hard as you do.

Plus, it\u2019s a smell that I do like.\n\nHow good is the hydration:\nThe cream goes on smooth, and absorbs into my skin pretty quickly. I didn\u2019t have to wait very long to feel my skin hydrated. But I actually didn\u2019t buy this product as a \u201cmoisturizer\u201d. The only reason I bought it was because it said \u201cCollagen\u201d, and I had thought that\u2019s what my lackluster and dull skin needed 5 months ago. Anyways, a week later, my face felt so baby-butt soft, smooth, and bouncy that I couldn\u2019t stop touching it. I was amazed! I was sold. It was a happy-accident! The hydration that it provides made my once flat and dull skin a bit plumper too! It keeps my skin hydrated all day.\n\nDoes it smell:\nI do like the smell as well. It grew on me. To me, it isn\u2019t strong, but it definitely leaves an Etude House impression (as others have said it smells very Etude House).\n\nRecommended to first-timers:\nBut this was just my first Korean moisturizer (and luckily worked). So, I would recommend this as a good Korean moisturizer for first-timers and for people who are wondering which they should get and just overwhelmed on choosing one, especially for normal-skin-types. There are always better and more hydrating Korean moisturizers, ones that are pricier and ones that are cheaper. It just all depends on your skin type and your needs. I know I\u2019m ready to try something new and better, because I know that if others fail, I will always have this to fall back on.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIt was just really nice to find something that I wasn\u2019t even looking for, and it happens to do well with my skin type and made it silky smooth. Yes, there are better ones at about the same price or more expensive, but this one DEFINITELY SHOWS RESULTS in as little as a week. The price is alright too, considering everything ($9 if you\u2019re lucky but ships from Korea in 30 days, usually $14 but already at USA Amazon warehouses so ships in a couple days).\n\nThis is the moisturizer that I started out with before I ventured out into more expensive Korean moisturizers, and I gotta say that I\u2019m really glad I did because I realized more expensive does not always mean better! I would buy this again in a heartbeat (I already have).\n\nHOW OFTEN & HOW DO I USE IT:\nI used it religiously every day and night for the first month, then once a day at night afterwards. At first, my skincare routine was just wash my face with regular cleanser then slap this on, but I found that my skin was more accepting and hydrating with this cream with regular exfoliating. Exfoliating just once every 2 weeks really made a huge difference; it was like night and day with how this cream absorbed into and hydrated my skin. Plus, exfoliating kept my pores from clogging up with ANY of the products I\u2019m now using. Now, I also use a toner (Son & Park Beauty Water) and a First Treatment Essence before I apply this Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream.\n\nOTHER PRODUCTS I\u2019VE USED AND REVIEWED:\nAt around the same time as right now, I\u2019ve also reviewed the following after using for 5-11 months, if you\u2019re interested in checking out:\n- Etude House Moistfull Collagen Cream, 2.53 Fl Oz.\n- Etude House New Moistfull Collagen Eye Cream, 0.94 Ounce.\n- MIZON Black Snail All In One Cream, 2.40 Ounce.\n- MISSHA M Perfect Cover BB Cream No.23 Natural Beige SPF42 PA+++ (50ml) and No.21.\n- [MIZON] Snail Repair Intensive Ampoule Set + Snail Repairing Foam Cleanser 60ml.\n- [MIZON] All in One Snail Repair Cream (120ml).\n- MIZON Snail Repair Blemish Balm, 1.69 Ounce.\n\nAdditional info about my SKIN, AGE, SEX, ACNE CONDITION, PORES, ETC if you\u2019re interested:\n- Combination skin with both dry, normal, and oily skin in different areas, with the oiliness being at my t-zone. The dry skin is around the crevices of my nose near my nostrils and near the mouth. But mostly, my skin is normal everywhere else.\n- 33 years old woman/female who never took care of her skin prior to 2018 (sad truth!), but I also rarely like to put makeup on either except for powder in the past (and BB cream nowadays).\n- Moderate amount of acne scars and some sun spots, but no major skin flaws. I\u2019ve never had any huge problems with acne except during my youth before 20, and one or two pimples during my period.\n- My pores WERE only big on my t-zone, a small area on my chin, and facial pores near each side of my nose. They used to be a problem before 2018, but now only my nose has the largest pores, which isn\u2019t even very big anymore after I\u2019ve been taking care of my skin.\n- I exfoliate my skin at least twice a month.", "This product it's great for dry skin, and little goes along way. If you use too much it will take long for your skin to absorb", "This product is absolutely amazing . I recently became knowledgeable about the South Korean skin care products and the So No skin care regimen and it is been one of the best discoveries I have ever found my life. I added this moisturizer as the last step in purchasing my South Korean beauty skin care products simply because I have a jars of skincare moisturizers in my bathroom cabinet that I figured I would use up and then buy the South Korean moisturizer for my skin. I decided to give up on the highly price end skin moisturizers in my cabinet because after using the other South Korean skincare products something just didn't feel right. So after reading many reviews I decided to go ahead and get the \u00c9tude House Moistfull Collagen Cream for my facial moisturizer. And Oh My Gosh this is probably one of the best purchases I have ever made in my life . In one day this moisturizer has made my skin look better than it did when I was 20 years old... that's more than half my life ago and I was a New York City model for about five years back then. I thought this cream would be a small amount due to the low price; it's not. It's quite a large amount of cream and I expect it to last a long time because just a dab on my fingertips covered my entire face and immediately drenched it in the softest silkiest smoothest moisturizer I have experienced in so many years I cannot remember the last time I used moisturizer this fantastic...if at all. It also has a really nice light citrus scent to it, very \"au natural\" without the steep price tag.\nI cannot believe how absolutely radiant my skin looks and how much it's glowing . Keep in mind however that I have been using other South Korean facial skin care regimen products: scrub, wash, toner, essence, serums. But really this was the icing on the cake. \u00c9tude House Moistfull Collagen Cream made my South Korean skin care regimen click. It added color to my cheeks like a pink glow that just radiates health and vitality. It didn't take away the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and forehead, however I didn't expect it to do that...it's a facial moisturizer. But because my skin on my face looks so wonderful it actually takes your eye away from the minor wrinkles that I have just simply due to age. This moisturizer is just amazing and I would recommend it to anyone who has dry skin , wanting to look more youthful , a gift to maybe for your mom or just a treat for yourself. If you're on the younger scale you might want to use it for preventative measures. I cannot stop singing the praises of this moisturizer . I am definitely going to buy it again again again. If I could afford to I'd buy it in bulk. Do yourself a favor...try it out. And for the price...less than $20! if you want beautiful glowing radiant healthy looking skin then try this moisturizer .", "I absolutely LOVE this stuff!!! I don\u2019t wear makeup anymore! There\u2019s no need for a foundation or powder with this stuff. I\u2019m smooth and even all over. Idk if it\u2019s the combination of my clearasil sensitive skin face wash and this that has me completely clear of facial blemishes for the first time in my life!!! I\u2019m 32 people, that\u2019s an accomplishment! Even through my period, no zits, that never happens! It\u2019s gotta be the combination. But I love this stuff! I got both my parents hooked on it and my best friend. I have super sensitive skin so the only other moisturizer I could use was vanicream. But that always left me greasy by mid day or the end of day for sure and my eyes started to burn at the end of the day. There\u2019s none of that with this stuff. It\u2019s like a jelly and goes on so smooth and isn\u2019t greasy. It has a faint scent which I like but it fades. A little goes a long way!\n\nEdit: I\u2019d been using this moisturizer for over a year and absolutely LOVED it! Then I couldn\u2019t get the old version that I had started out using so I had to buy the new version. I figured it would be fine since the other version was so great. WRONG!! My face broke out in hives. Like little bumps with tiny white heads and my face burned. It didn\u2019t happen right away. I used quite a bit of the cream so I didn\u2019t think that was it at first. I thought it was something I ate. But I kept weeding everything out until I was eating just salads. Then I stopped using the cream since it was the new version. Low and behold that was it. The first 2 pictures are from a week after it was at its worst. The other picture is from when I was using the old cream and my face was clear and I didn\u2019t even have to wear make up! I\u2019m so disappointed!!", "Okay, I will admit that I first heard/read about this product in one of those Buzzfeed 'best items on amazon' lists that they post. I usually don't click on those things but this was the picture that linked to the list and it caught my attention. I read all the reviews on Amazon and I was blown away. I couldn't believe that this product was this amazing. The reviews were so good that I ended up buying it (plus, I won't lie - I've bought and used korean beauty products before - hello gold/snail under eye patches) so now.....here's the review:\n\n1. This product feels so damn amazing going on my skin. So smooth and soft and truly it feels like the softest moisturizer I've EVER used.\n2. My face feels so amazing when I wake up in the morning. I put this one at night after taking off my makeup (and after my proactiv) and my skin feels the softest it's felt since damn near middle school.\n3. The little spatula it comes with is you friend. Why? Because it helps you control the amount of product you're pulling out so you don't waste AND you can use every single drop of the product on the lid by using the spatula to pull it all off.\n4. The product smells really clean but if you've ever used any korean products before you know that is a a standard bonus with all of their products.\n\nI think that this is a product that you could use day or night and it won't feel heavy or greasy. I choose to use it at night because my day cream is part of my proactiv treatment. Plus I love that I can have it on my face working it's magic overnight while I sleep and not have any makeup covering it. If you're looking for a great, affordable moisturizer that will do it's job and do it well, I highly recommend this product. If you're thinking about dipping your toe into the pool of korean skin care products, I highly recommend this product.\n\nLong review short - I high recommend this product.", "this one on further research is not, So i do like, but will not be ordering from this line again\nMore like a gel cream, goes on easily, absorbs quickly. Light to no scent. Very hydrating, again if this was cruelty free, i would buy again....", "Unlike other creams I've tried, this one isn't sticky or tacky. It's very light, smells awesome, and my skin looks fresher with continued use! The packaging is also super cute (as always with Etude House). Definitely buying another after mine runs out (soon!!!!)", "The packaging has changed a little since the last time I bought this product but from what I can tell it works the same. This is absolutely my favorite Etude House product. It's moisturizing without leaving my skin greasy in the east coast summer humidity. I have combination skin, dry patches near my mouth and oily forehead. This product takes care of both areas without causing skin issues like acne or oily spots.", "This moisturizer has a light cream/gel consistency. It's not a heavy, thick moisturizer at all. For moderately dry skin, or even combination skin this would probably work well as a night time moisturizer, but for my very dry skin, it wasn't moisturizing enough. The real problem I have with it though, is it's SCENT. It has an overwhelmingly floral scent. I am not typically a fan of scented products on my face, but I can deal with it if the scent is mild, but this product doesn't fall into that category. It also really irritated my eyes (yes, I put moisturizer around my eyes and 99% of the time it never bothers me, this one did, probably from the perfume in the product). I did like that it had hydrolyzed collagen, maybe that works, maybe it doesn't, but that was one of the reasons I chose this particular moisturizer. So, to sum up, it's not a bad moisturizer, if you don't need anything heavy, it will do the job, but just be sure that you like overwhelming floral scents or you will hate this product. *Would NOT recommend for sensitive skin*", "I know what you're thinking- at this price point, how great can a moisturizer be? As far as I'm concerned, it's my holy grail of moisturizers, and I've tried Clinique, SKII, La Prairie, La Mer, La Roche Posay, Avene...the amount I've spent trying to find a good antiaging moisturizer is almost obscene, considering the modest price tag on this simple little orange jar.\n\nDon't let the packaging fool you- the jar is pretty but it IS plastic, and it feels a little like kid's toy (it has that soft plastic feel and weight). It comes with a spatula and, depending on the length of your fingernails/how fussy you are about getting bacteria into the jar from your fingers, you will definitely want to use the spatula, because the moisturizer is a little goopy.\n\nTo me, the smell is reminiscent of that classic St. Ives collagen moisturizer, with a hint of citrus added. It's a little strong, but frankly it could smell like wet dog and I would still use it, for how well it works. That being said, if you're sensitive to fragrances you'll want to keep this in mind- it does NOT have a mild smell, but it will go away quickly.\n\nI use this essentially every single day, sometimes twice a day. Always in the morning under my Shiseido sunscreen (followed by makeup), and sometimes at night over my tretinoin. It absorbs fairly fast, and it is really, really soothing in the winter, if your skin gets dry. In the winter my skin will reach the point where only avocado oil doesn't make it sting, but of all the moisturizers I've used, this one stings the least and for the shortest amount of time. I've used it on hot days as well, and on my dry skin it's perfect, though I'm not sure how well it would work for normal/oily skin. It might be a bit heavy.\n\nI'm on my second jar, and my only regret is that it doesn't come in a giant economy size, so that I could literally cover myself in it during the cold months. It's such a relief to have finally found a product that moisturizes, plumps up fine lines, and doesn't cost a small fortune!", "I REALLY wanted this to be perfect for me. I read through every review, I've had other Etude House products before, it seemed so promising. And to be clear, it feels soooo nice! It's lightweight, goes on very easily, doesn't have a weird texture; I thought it was the perfect moisturizer to complete my 10-step routine. But there are two big problems:\n\n1. This unfortunately does clog pores - not a little, a lot. The first time I put it on was at night, so when I saw blackheads and full pores in the morning, I thought, \"okay, maybe I had a greasy night or something.\" But less than two hours after cleansing and doing my morning routine (which cleared out all pores - no blackhead nor sebum in sight!) I went and looked in the mirror and was genuinely shocked by how quickly the pores on my nose and sides of my face had filled. The only thing I changed was this moisturizer and that is not normal behavior for my skin. I have dry/combination skin.\n2. The perfume. I am a person with very sensitive skin who avoids fragranced products, but I do have some that work and because I've used Etude House before I decided to give it a try. Ironically, it is one of the only skin product scents I have ever actually liked - but it is a STRONG smell and by mid-morning today, 4 hours after my second application, I started having an allergic reaction which will take much longer for my skin to recover from than if I'd spent another 10 minutes finding a different product to try. Sigh.\n\nIf your pores are immune to clogging and your skin loves fragrance, go for it. Otherwise I would say it's just not worth the risk.", "My sister introduced me to this brand, and I have not tipped using it since. It\u2019s been 2 years already and no other moisturizer that claim it\u2019s for dry skin compared to this one. If you have really dry skin they have a thicker version but this one is really good for when it\u2019s hot outside, you don\u2019t get too oily.", "***2-2019 Update: I have been using this face lotion every day for more than a year after my initial review and I stand by my review. All of my reorders have been consistent in quality and I will continue to use as long as it does.***\n\n** 6- 2018 Update: I have now used this lotion for 4 1/2 months, every night and I am just now at the last of my supply! Reordering because I love this lotion so much. My face continues to feel the smoothest and most moisturized it has ever felt!**\n\nBuying skincare products online is tough, but I wanted to try this because of the reviews and price.\n\nI typically use Clinique Mositure Surge Intense and I have normal to dry skin. I knew this likely wouldn\u2019t live up to what I was used to, but I also wanted to try it because the price is so much better!\n\nFirst off, the lotion is more than double the OZ size than Clinique. Mine arrived in a box with a little plastic applicator and the lotion had a plastic cover inside.\n\nI have used this face lotion for a week and counting and thus far, I am very satisfied with this. The first couple of days, I was hesitant to like it because it was different than what I\u2019m used to, but I continued using and now love it! It\u2019s important to let your skin adjust to a new lotion. Try it for at least a week before making your decision.\n\nThis is NOT as thick as Clinique. It does absorb fast, but as I write this (30 min after applying), I don\u2019t think my face has ever felt this smooth and soft.\n\nThis DOES have a scent to it. Much stronger than Clinique, but I like the scent. To each their own on this.\n\n5 stars for me as a Clinique Replacement. If you\u2019re wanting to save money and willing to try a new product, don\u2019t mind scent and willing to try for at least a week, give this a go!", "**Update**\nI ordered the new version because the old is probably all gone by now. It works as well as the old version and my skin is loving it still. It does have a much stronger perfume that is quite noticeable. I suppose I will get used to it but if you are sensitive to fragrance, you may not like it. I switched to COSRX for a while and when I applied this cream last night, my skin instantly felt smoother and bouncier. While they are all good brands, you just need to find the formula that is best suited for your skin, and my skin chooses this one over and over.\n\nThe cream is both light weight but moisturizing. I was skeptical about how effective it could be. well. it's giving me surprisingly glowing skin! A jar goes a long time, like 4- 5 months, and it guarded my skin against dry winter months, which again, exceeded my expectation. I have since put my mom on it as well, she loves it but for her very dry skin, i got her the intense cream and she loves it as well.", "I got this because some website said it was a cheaper dup of the Clinique Moisture Surge. But texture wise this product was creamier than the Clinqiue (which seemed more gel based to me). Effect wise i thought it was really good, it absorbed well. I give it 4/5 because it helped my dry skin at the time but maybe because the weather now my face is dry again. Although i have been traveling between cold/hot climates so that could have contributed but this wasn't helping as well this time since my makeup wasn't sitting well on my skin and i could see flakes. Looking into trying other moisturizers before i go back to this.\n\nMy skin is combo/oily, mainly oily in the t-zone and slight dry under my nose/forehead. This didn't make my face more/less oily. But i did feel like i would wake up and my face would look decent, still oily but color was less red around my nose area. I bought it in December and it lasted until mid-March and i usually used it in the morn and night.\n\nThere is a slight fragrance to this but it seemed refreshing. I wish this had SPF since I had to wear that on top.", "Each month House Beautiful runs a feature entitled, \"What's On Your Vanity,\" highlighting the design elements and various \"objets\" in the dressing area of a decorating industry insider.

I'd never heard of Etude House and, despite the bargain price, here was some well-heeled, in-the-know New Yorker touting it in a national magazine.\n\nI had to try.\n\nThis really lives up to the recommendation. It's an amazing bargain for something that's comparable to [one of my favorites] Le Metier de Beaute in terms of texture and moisturizing capabilities. And it's less than one-tenth the price! It has a slippery, almost gel-like, feel making it easy to smooth over your face and throat. It has a light citrus scent, but not lemon as you might expect, but more like a grapefruit or blood-orange. Currently, I have a number of night creams in my medicine cabinet - Vichy, L'Oreal and Le Metier de Beaute - but this has taken over as my new favorite. I've been using it every night for a week and I wake up looking fresh and dewy. I fully intend to check out other Etude House products which, like many other Korean brands, seems to offer high quality at a super-affordable price-point.\n\nHey Roxy, thanks for the tip!", "This is my holy grail moisturizer. I have very dry skin due to hormonal birth control and it gets even worse during winter. I've tried Aveeno moisturizers(they used to work for me fine), It Cosmetics, First Aid Beauty, Lancome, many others. The only one that is similar to this is Belif's moisturizer(coincidentally another Korean brand).\n\nThis is pretty heavy, but it's really great for severely dry skin. Any time my skin gets flaky, it's the ONLY cream that fixes it. I use the spatula that it comes with for sanitary purposes- which I am so happy about btw. Many brands don't include spatulas. I take a scoop of the moisturizer and that's generally all that I need. A little goes a long way, but if my skin is super dry I usually put on two layers.\nThis hasn't caused me any acne breakouts or hives; the only thing I've encountered while using this are milia on my eyelids, but they're rare. I'll get one or two very rarely and they're simple enough to get rid of.\nIt sinks into your skin eventually, so it doesn't feel greasy or anything. Give it a bit to dry down a little. It works great with makeup also. It lessens the need for primer.\nIt also gives a beautiful, healthy glow and super smooth looking skin. It's truly amazing. I used Foxbrim Hyaluronic Acid serum during the summer for my skin last year, but then I switched to this and it's sooooo much better. I'm only in my 20's, but am not the healthiest and live a fairly stressful life, and I notice that I look a lot more youthful when I use this. I would recommend it to anyone with dry skin, or anyone trying to prevent signs of aging. It's amazing.", "I have combination skin and have been struggling to find a good moisturizer for awhile that doesn't leave my skin feeling like a greasy pan halfway through the day. I first heard about this cream on the AsianBeauty reddit and a lot of people were swearing by this stuff and I can say I'm also a fan. It's not a miracle cure for oily skin but it works better on my combination skin than any other moisturizer I've ever tried. Given it's been winter weather since I've started using this so the oily factor isn't as strong but my skin has definitely been less oily by the afternoon after applying in the mornings. I've typically used drugstore stuff (CereVe, Neutrogena and most recently, Alba Botanica and Paula's Choice) and while some were okay, none have been just the right formula for me to avoid feeling and looking oily by the end of the day. This one goes on pretty light and absorbs well. I'm able to apply to my face and start putting on the rest of my make up within a minute and it doesn't feel heavy or super wet. I think the only other moisturizer that came somewhat close to this light of a feeling was Paula's Choice Ultra Sheer Daily Defense. I wish this cream had some SPF in it but I'm fixing that problem by mixing in some Etude sunscreen since sun protection is no joke! I would definitely recommend and buy again.", "Wish this was in a pump bottle as the products in jars, unless you use a spatula every time, get contaminated. This is a nice general moisture cream that is not very heavy but does have a scent, it is pleasant and light and does go away after a few minutes. A small amount goes a long way, so start with a tiny amount and see how your skin soaks it up. Purchased this because I heard the band was great, and essentially it does do a good job, it is better than any other cream well I don't think so, I have tried the extremely overpriced Le Mer and honestly, this reminded me of that. Both are fine and do a decent job. This is much less expensive. I have tried it as a primer also with decent results. It really depends upon you and your body chemistry and skin type. As with all of these products do a test for any allergy first before slatering it all over your face.", "4 stars instead of 5 because I use this product as a sort of \"night cream\" - I initially bought this so that I could use it as a day cream but found that it felt a little too heavy for me to use during the day.\n\nI have combination skin and am in my late 20s and I don't like the feel of super heavy creams which this one isn't, which is why this is perfect for me as a night cream.\nThe things I like about the cream:\n\n+ makes face feel very smooth\n+ the scent is pleasant (it almost seems.. flowery?)\n+ I've noticed less flakiness on the dry parts of my skin (cheeks, forehead)\n+ absorbs fairly quickly\n+ a little goes a long way\n\nThings I don't like about the cream:\n\n+ a little too heavy to use in the morning for me\n+ felt like my skin was shiny and oily when I used it under makeup\n+ the cute little spatula (What do I do with this? Can't I just use my fingers? Do I stick it back into the cream after using? I was confused.)\n\nAll in all, I think this is a great cream but perhaps it would be better for people with dry skin to use.\nAnd of course, if you have combination skin like me, I would highly recommend it as a nice little night cream."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JGN7GV3", "title": "SLOWCORP.

The bottle and pump are kinda crazy, but work fine. I can use a single pump and clean a sinkful of not super dirty dishes easily. I feel confident the soap cleans my dishes well enough to keep using it. I do appreciate that my hands don't feel super dry after using this soap too.", "The final ingredient for this DISH SOAP is \"FLAVOR\". I am sorely tempted to taste it to try to figure out what the hello is going on. \"Flavor\" is listed on both the bottle & on the cardboard packaging. Perhaps this is a mistake, perhaps not... Oh how I want to taste this to find out, but yeah, no, I'm not doing it.\n\nPerformance:\nI like it. I run my own Eco Farm full time. I have many rain barrel set ups outside. I like to keep a bottle of Eco Friendly dish soap for cleaning animal dishes, my hands, feet, legs, & a myriad of other items that need a washing that I'm not thinking of at this exact moment.. ah ha! Mud on ones shoes is another. Anyway...\n\nThe shape of this bottle is awesome for my outdoor set up. The squat triangular shape with generous pump top means it doesn't topple over in the wind & my hands are free. I seriously love this. It has almost no scent which is fine by me. I don't like to use strong perfume dish soaps. I almost always opt for fragrance free versions of any Eco Friendly soap.\n\nThe packaging is a triangle shaped box. The bottle is plastic. I'm not a fan of plastics, but this can be refilled! Buy Eco bulk dish soap & refill it. I love this. This is the bottle my outdoor rain barrel stations have been waiting for. Sheer perfection... Except for the flavor!?!?! Keep this one far far far away from kids & pets just in case it actually is flavored. Unless maybe it's flavored with something nasty? You can taste it if you want. I'm not doing it. lol.", "This dishwashing soap is a clean ingredient option for those wanting to make a difference in our environment and also for the health of our hands and body. The soap did a decent job of cleaning my pot that I used it on. The scent is very light and almost nonexistent. I think it would be great for anyone that has any sensitivities to smells. However I do like a little more scent with my cleaning products as long as those scents are essential oils and not fragrance. I do like the shape of the dispenser as it makes it easier to pump it into your sink or into a pot or pan. I\u2019m not sure I would purchase the product again as I didn\u2019t notice anything extra special about it other than it being clean and better for the environment. That is an important issue that needs to be addressed, so I appreciate that about the product.", "This soap cleans about as good as my regular dish soap, although I do have to use a bit more of this soap than my regular dish soap to get the same coverage. The expiration of this soap is on the cardboard container that this product comes on and not on the plastic part of the container which is a little weird. Anyway, it has an expiration date of 2 years from date of manufacture.. which means that you really have to be the type of person that constantly washes dishes in order for it to make sense to get this.\nAlthough the soap is safer than most soaps, it does contain the preservative sodium benzoate, which can turn into benzene if it comes into contact with vitamin C. But to be fair, a lot of other types of preservatives out there also have problems as well and I would expect dish soap to have something like this in it.", "Pretty decent soap but for the price I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s worth it for me. Being that it\u2019s plant-based and vegan I am sure if you\u2019re vegan you wouldn\u2019t mind paying the extra money to have good dish soap. The soap itself works well but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s better than Dawn. It has a very faint smell of ginger if you smell it really close on your hands. Nothing overwhelming at all. Overall it gets the dishes clean and if you\u2019re willing to pay the price for a vegan natural dish soap then I definitely recommend this one.", "This SLOWCORP. Dishwashing Liquid Dish Soap was appealing due to its high quality ingredients, lack of chemicals, and fresh, unique scent. The pump works well and comes in a cute container. It works well at cleaning dishes and also is gentle on the hands and rather moisturizing too. It lathers well too which is often an issue with sulfate free soaps. I think the product is great, but the price is rather expensive considering the size of the container so you have to be willing to pay a premium for it.", "I ordered the SlowCorp liquid dish soap through the Vine program, in Fresh Ginger and Yuzu. The smell is light and quite nice- even hubby said it smell nice. It seems to wash the dishes as well as my other (cheaper) blue dish soap. At the current price of about $19, this is a bit out of my price range for daily use. BUT, I would consider adding this to a basket/bucket of cleaning supplies as a housewarming present, especially for someone getting their first place. The triangle bottle is a bit awkward but helps to make it \"special\".", "SLOWCORP. Dishwashing Dish Soap has light smell. I like it contains plant-based ingredients that will not hurt my hand skin. It does the clean job no problem. But normally plant based dishwashing soap is not as powerful as chemically derived soaps.", "I have a tiny 60s kitchen and this bottle just wouldn\u2019t fit next to my old sink, it\u2019s very large and odd shape. But after I poured into a leftover slim, taller bottle, it was perfect. Nice scent and good bubbles, easy on the hands too.", "I've never used a bottle of this shape before but it's really convenient when you are doing dishes. This is a very nice size and the soap doesn't have a strong scent. It rinses very clean and we even washed our hands with it. The price is what would prevent me from buying it again, I just can't afford $18 for dish soap. However it's very nice and gentle, and I really the shape of the bottle. It's very gentle and doesn't irritate our skin.", "I love the low triangular bottle, as it sits so nicely on my sink and it's not easily knocked over into my sink, like what has happened to many other bottles. I have eczema on my hands, which is agitated by any type of cleaner I use, and even though I still wear gloves whenever I wash dishes, if I need to do a quick clean-up with this soap, I don't have to quickly put on my gloves. I can use it without worry to the damage on my hands.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how well this dishwashing liquid cleaned my dishes, especially baked in stains. I did have to let the soap and water soak for awhile for me to be able to wipe off the set in, but it worked!", "This is a good liquid dish soap. It comes in a triangular plastic bottle with a convenient pump dispenser. The soap itself is thick and clear. It suds nicely and cleans the dishes well. It does a decent job of cutting through grease and making the dishes sparkling clean. The ginger and yuzu scent is mild but pleasant. It doesn't linger on the dishes after rinsing.\n\nI appreciate that the dish soap is based on a vegan formula. It is free of the many harsh chemicals and seems gentle on my sensitive skin. It is designed in USA and made in Korea. It comes packaged in an environment-friendly cardboard box. Overall, it works well and gets the job done. Though it is pretty expensive for a 16.9 fl. oz. bottle of liquid detergent.", "The very first impression. Great packaging with the unique design of the box and the pump bottle. Feels premium. Overall it is a great dishwashing liquid for utensils. It could have been our favorite going forward but the price factor is something that stops me.\n\nOur (My wife & I) 2 cents below:\n\nPros:\n- Clean dishes pretty well\n- Smells great\n- Easy to use via pump bottle\n- Plant based nice ingredients\n- Should be a great option for baby bottles and dishes too\n- Free from parabens, sulfates, phthalates, dyes, or synthetic fragrances\n\nCons:\n- Not reasonably priced ($19) for this much quantity (16.9 fl. oz)", "If you're hoping this smells fantastic, it doesn't. It is almost unscented. Very very very VERY light fragrance, almost undetectable. Which is fine with me. I like the shape of the container, it's easy to use and easy to pump. Doesn't hold much and you'll be wasting a lot of these packages unless you get some kind of refill. The soap works great on my dishes.", "The majority of the dish soaps I use are natural type just soaps because I don't like the idea of using the more conventional soaps because of the questionable ingredients some of them contain. I was excited to give this a try because it is free of most of the questionable ingredients that concern me.\n\nThis thing I want to talk about right off the bat is the rather unique shape of this bottle that the soap comes in. This definitely strays away from the standard bottle cylindrical shape. It is a triangular pyramid shape, which is unique and fun. I thought it was kind of weird at first but after using it for a while now I actually prefer it to the regular bottles because the wide base makes it more sturdy. When I use the pump to get the soap out it doesn't tip over the way most of my other dish bottles often tend to do.\n\nI like that this has a light citrucy sent to it but that it isn't overwhelming or very strong. It it is very natural smelling.\n\nSomething that surprised me is how much of a lather this soap gives my sponges. It is long lasting and very effective in getting grease and residue off my dishes. In my experience, a lot of the more natural soaps I am used to using to using do not have long lasting bubbles. This one does.\n\nEven though this is slightly expensive, I still say, considering the excellent quality and effectivity this soap has, that I would recommend it.", "This dishwasher liquid has a light ginger smell. It is quite diluted and I have to use more than other brands to thoroughly clean my dishes. It is fine, but not better than Dawn. Buy this if you want a plant based dish soap but realize the results are inferior to chemically derived soaps.", "I'm 'quickly' developing an affection for quality products from SLOWCORP. I love their tooth brushes and this dish soap is top notch. Of course the first thing that strikes you is the triangular box and bottle that encases this fantastic dish soap. It certainly looks cool sitting beside the sink but it is actually practical as well. First off, the container is shorter and wider than a typical tall, oval-shaped soap bottle. This makes it far more stable. It's pretty much impossible to fall over if bumped. Secondly, for me it is a dish-time reminder of a triune God who loves me and washes away my many imperfections. Thirdly, the pump on the bottle is perfect for soaping a scrubby sponge. No need to pick up the bottle with slippery hands. Half a pump and you're good to go.\n\nThe soap seems quite concentrated so a little goes a long way. The fragrance is light and pleasant. It cuts grease well and even doubles as a hand cleaner when I sneak to the kitchen sink after working on the tractor.", "What I like most about this dish soap are the moisturizing and natural ingredients, especially since I don\u2019t like to wear gloves when washing dishes. This cleans well and is easy to rinse off. I like the long spout on the bottle which makes it easy to quickly add soap to my sponge, no more lifting up the bottle. I keep it by the side of the sink which makes it easy to add a few pumps of soap when I\u2019m filling up the sink with water.", "I really love the bottle it comes in, it\u2019s cute and definitely different lol, It really don\u2019t have a scent, it says light scent but I can\u2019t smell it at all but I do love how soft it makes my hands feel after using it, I also love that it doesn\u2019t contain any bad chemicals and it\u2019s also vegan. You could use it to clean baby toys and baby supplies without having to worry about any bad chemicals, it\u2019s kinda thick and clear and it doesn\u2019t leave any residue on the dishes at all which is a plus, i also like that it has a long spout so the soap comes out really easy, I will be using this brand from now on and I would recommend it!!", "First of all, I love the design of the bottle. It\u2019s cute and eye catching. My guests were asking where I got it. I like the scent of the liquid. It\u2019s very light and almost no scent. Smells natural. I feel safe to use. I used it for cleaning greasy pans, and it cleaned fine. My hands didn\u2019t get so dry after washing the plates suing this soap. Normally, my hand gets extremely dry using other dishwasher soap. My favorite part is this liquid soap is Plant-derived Formula."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09K2CJJP8", "title": "Schmidt's Aluminum Free Natural Deodorant For Women And Men, Hemp Seed Oil & Sage With 24 Hour Odor Protection, Certified Natural, Cruelty Free, Vegan Deodorant 2.65oz 2 Pack", "price": " ", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81JDlsowrdL._SX425_.jpg", "ratings": "91 ratings", "description": "Really Natural.

Definitely buy this product.", "So basically I started using wet wipes in January in place of tissue because it felt cleaner. Within that same time frame (which I didn\u2019t realize until later) I began getting terrible red blotchy spots and anytime there was moisture \u201cdown there\u201d it would begin to itch so at the time & as a woman, I associated the itch with a yeast infection even though there was never an overgrowth of yeast. After a few months of praying it would go away On its own I finally went to my gynecologist who just gave me diflucan and sent me on my way because it was clearing up. (Also need I mention, the only relief I got was when my period came on for some strange reason I\u2019m sure it had something to do with hormones). So one day I remembered how the wet wipes used to make me itch when I first started using them and just stopped. I googled \u201cwet wipe allergy\u201d and came across the term \u201cvulvar dermatitis\u201d and looked at the images which looked EXACTLY like the area after I\u2019d take a hot shower, or come home from a 12 hr shift. The thing about dermatitis is it doesn\u2019t just go away, it takes time so even after I stopped using the wet wipes if I\u2019d take a hot shower it would irritate the area, if I had no other option visiting a friends house and used a wet wipe it would start the whole recovery process over, if my clothing rubbed the area it would irritate it as well. It got so bad that it started affecting me mentally because it wasn\u2019t a come and go thing (except around my monthly) it was literally everyday I was dealing with it. I stopped waxing for two months because I felt like it was wearing the skin down and causing it to get further irritated. I found out tea tree was good for dermatitis. I bought the tea tree balm on Amazon but it was like, if I put it on and went about my day eventually it would get irritated again because of the moisture. If I didn\u2019t it would be dry and itchy so I thought about just washing the area with tea tree to see what would happen. After about three weeks of using it my period came on and the inflammation went away as always, I went and got a wax a few days after it went off and low and behold there was no trace of vulvar dermatitis left. I waited a few days to make sure it didn\u2019t come back and I sit here today writing this review to say I AM FREE!!!!\n\nP.S. Sorry for the long review I just wanted to be as detailed as possible for anybody else who may be affected by dermatitis without realizing what it is because it literally almost drove me crazy. Thanks to faith and this little green bottle I am back to my old self.", "The smell is pretty strong, but that\u2019s the nature of tea tree. It works well without irritating my skin.", "This. Stuff. Is. Amazing.\nI've struggled with toenail fungus and athlete's foot for years due to an injury and then working in an environment where my shoes were always getting wet. My doctor at the time told me it was a vitamin deficiency, and by the time I realized she was wrong, it was too late and all 5 toenails were infected. I tried EVERYTHING you can get OTC, and probably spent hundreds on all sorts of potions and lotions and topical treatments. I found a new Dr, who prescribed medication to try and kill it. Nothing worked. The past two years, I've hid my foot 24/7. I used to wear flipflops year round, and it was so frustrating and embarrassing.\nI saw this online one day by chance. It had decent reviews, and cost half of what I'd usually drop on the newest cure at the drugstore, so I decided to give it a try.\nWithin a week, my feet were noticeably smoother, the dead skin was coming off, but they were no longer cracking, itching, and painful. Now, about a month later, the skin on the affected foot looks just as clear as the healthy one. Two toenails look perfectly healthy, they were the least infected to start off with. The other three are noticably stronger, no longer cracking, and all three have clean pink nail coming in.\nAfter a week or so of only using this on my feet, I decided to try it as an all over body wash, and now I'm hooked! I used to have to reapply deodorant throughout the day, now I could really go without it if I wanted. Also (TMI) but for the ladies, I haven't had a single yeast infection since using this stuff. And it makes my skin feel SO fresh and clean, without drying it one bit. Even the most \"moisturizing\" body washes used to dry my skin! For me, at least, this product is a miracle.\nAnd for those that say it didn't work, I would bet they used one bottle, and were mad that a month's worth of treatment didn't clear an infection that had spread over YEARS. The thing that sucks about toenail fungus is, regardless of what treatment you use, it usually takes months, maybe even a year, of constant use and attention to get rid of it. Look up costly laser treatments, or antifungal pills, or anything else. None of them are quick fixes, and they usually either cost a fortune, involve removing your toenails, or damage your liver.\nAnd just fyi, I'm not at all affiliated with this company. I wish I was, so I could get this stuff more often! After telling the customer service rep about my experience (they contact you once they see you've received it to make sure you're satisfied ), she asked me to post my story on here, and I promised I would.\nAlso, the customer service in general is amazing. I wish every company was like this one. They respond immediately, and keep in contact to make sure you're fully satisfied. So really, evenif you're not up to the commitment required to cure a fungal infection, you still have nothing to lose by trying it.", "I've been dealing with tinea versicolor for years and it is no longer an issue for me since using this! The body wash has a strong scent, but once rinsed and dried off it barely lingers. At first I figured it would dry my skin out, but it is surprisingly moisturizing. My husband has even become a fan.

The last year has been disappointment central. I\u2019m clearly insane because I have kept buying them hoping to get the old ones while being let down every time. I\u2019ve contacted Huggies l, sent pictures, sent lot numbers, I get the same response every time- we take your babies comfort and safety very seriously, nothing has changed. By reading through these reviews and looking at the photos, clearly that\u2019s a lie. Old orders were very plush, soft, very absorbent, fibers weren\u2019t left all over my kid, I never had to spend time picking the fibers from my kid\u2019s undercarriage, the prints didn\u2019t rub off. My kid doesn\u2019t spend much time in a diaper after it\u2019s wet so it\u2019s not a matter of time mixing with pee causing the diaper to break down and leave pieces behind, or letting the print rub off. The last two, maybe three, boxes have showed up without damage but the diapers are hard. When squished the hard parts are sharp. It seems like they\u2019re coming in contact with moisture during manufacturing. These were my favorite but having a kid with eczema, these new issues are pushing me to give another brand a try. I wish we could have the old ones back \ud83d\udc4e", "Second baby we have used these diapers on, wish they would of been around when my first was born. They are soo soft and very absorbent. My oldest loves seeing the Dalmatian prints on baby sis. Like any diaper on any baby you will occasionally have a leak especially if you can\u2019t change them very frequently or you don\u2019t out it on correctly but for us we experience minimum leaks. I tried Parent\u2019s Choice\u2026big mistake. She had two leaks at least a day and that was two outfits a day that needed changing, no thank you. I went I mean ran back to these as fast as I could, didn\u2019t even finish the parent\u2019s choice pack of diapers. Another thing to note is because of how soft the covering is and especially the inside both of my children who have sensitive skin as well as eczema haven\u2019t had any problems with breaking out with these diapers either!", "These are the best diapers for preventing leaks, and they are seriously so soft. You can see and feel the quality. They keep her skin dry even if the diaper is soaked, so we haven\u2019t had to worry about diaper rash at all. I used pampers newborn diapers with my first daughter, and had so many leaks and so much diaper rash. These truly are the best.", "My daughter has the most sensitive skin. These diapers are the only diapers I can use. I\u2019ve tried to use Pampers and the regular Huggies, and she breaks out in a rash every single time but these are amazing she\u2019s never had a rash with these diapers.", "The huggies special delivery diapers are the softest, nicest diapers I\u2019ve found! I wish they made them in larger size, but I always give a box for baby shower gifts, as well! Love these!", "Better than pampers and honest, these were by far our favorite for our newborn. Soft as cloth, absorbent, and as a bonus the designs were adorable.", "These were great on my newborn. They absorbed well, and never caused a rash. I wish the were totally chlorine free instead of elemental chlorine free though.", "I love everything about these diapers", "We used a few baby diapers some caused skin redness but this one avoided that problem", "Update: I have used these for overnight and am canceling my Pampers overnight diaper subscription, these hold up so well and are completely dry in the morning, by far the best diapers out there!\nI have tried many diaper brands (hello bello, honest, Pampers pure, Pampers baby dry, Pampers overnight, Huggies little movers and little crawlers, Costco brand) and absolutely none of them compare to these. These are the most absorbent and softest diapers there are. I have not tried them for overnight yet, Pampers overnight works well for us however with the absorbency these have I will be trying an overnight soon. A few diapers I found as soon as my son peed it never fully dried, the diaper that is touching his skin would be damp, these automatically are dry to the touch right after peeing as if he did not just urinate! I love them. Never switching brands again!", "I used to be a huge fan of the P brand, but I found these with my 4th baby and fell in love. They're so soft and great at preventing blow outs!

If you can afford it, this is the best option.", "No blow outs using this product. \ud83d\ude0a", "Pretty upset over the pattern on the diaper. I know it seems like a dumb thing to be upset over but I liked the generic, pastel design that\u2019s on the other Huggies Special Delivery. This design is bright and bold and shows through clothes.

Depending on level of activity it lasts a long time, for me an average 48 hours. For extraneous exercising, I do still turn to my Clinical Strength, but this is perfect for day-to-day. My cons are: it does leave residue on clothes so make sure to apply after putting your clothing on and it can be a bit crumby as it is a solid, so be sure to properly cap and store it when not using it. One last tip because I saw another reviewer complain about it: Expose only what you need. The product is a push system, meaning that if you expose more product than you need you\u2019ll have to manually push the deodorant back down. So be sparing and don\u2019t go crazy with it, you don\u2019t need a lot for it to do it\u2019s thing. Expose what you need.\nOk I\u2019m done with my lecture. Great product, highly recommend.", "Finally, the usual formula but in a more eco friendly package. I am one of those people who can\u2019t use baking soda deodorant which is the only way I can get eco friendly deodorant to work. This is the non eco formula but in a reusable case with a cardboard insert. I work outside in Virginia and this works to keep me at least smell good till end of day. I\u2019d say lasts 12-18 hours which honestly is what I want. Thank you for finally doing this!", "I ordered this product because it was refillable, better for the environment; all it takes is one consumer at a time. I am waiting to see if less would be more because this product has less ounces than the one you would purchase in the store however that does not mean the longevity is any less\nI will give a honest update after use.", "Perfect. This works and I will bet that if enough of us buy this, Amazon will start selling refills.

I was happy to see a refillable version because I try to cut down on plastic, which is not an easy thing to do. I also like that it has been designated cruelty-free by PETA. My only issue is that it isn't easy to find refill pods. Amazon doesn't sell the pods separately. Target seems to be the best bet.", "I have been looking and looking for a plastic free alternative anti persperant that DIDN'T take the aluminum out of their product. I actually LIKE to smell good and all the other alternative aluminum free brands I would try just could not do the job. I searched and searched and could not find plastic free actual antipersperant. I finally find this product. I LOVE IT!!! Its ease to use. You don't even actually need the applicator, you can just order the pods and use those for totally plastic free. I love the scents, rose and lavender. They work really well. The only problem or catch? Of course, there's always gotta friggin be one. You can barely find just the pods anywhere>>>>??? PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE START MAKING THE PODS MORE AVAILABLE again!!!!! I will be loyal for life and so would alot of others!!", "Seen starter kits on Amazon, but no refills yet? Also, can't find these in the grocery stores around here in OH which is disappointing. It would be so nice to be able to refill and not use so much plastic! I love the idea and love the product though. The scents are wonderful and leaves your skin soft and smooth. Not harsh in any way.", "I think this product is a great idea in moving toward getting rid of single use plastics. HOWEVER, how are you helping to get rid of single use plastics if the refills are not available without buying the refill container as well?", "I wanted to love this, trying to be more eco-friendly. But this is incredibly wasteful and poorly designed. For one, you don\u2019t get as much deodorant as you do in their regular products. For another, this tube is poorly designed. The deodorant plug never feels stable inside the tube because really it isn\u2019t. There isn\u2019t anything holding it in there. It doesn\u2019t stick into anything. Worst of all\u20141/3 of each tube is completely wasted, unless you are prepared to just put it in your hand and use it and get deodorant all over your hand. This is again because the tube is poorly designed. The button you turn to get the product to come up stops when it\u2019s 2/3 finished.

Very easy on the lungs and should be a big plus for those who are extra sensitive to the smell of all sorts of other products.\n\nWorks well too, from what I can tell. Of course, it's really difficult to tell if it's actually fighting germs, but when I sprayed this in my trashcan, that contained a little food garbage, it got rid of the smell.

I have Parosmia which makes the smell of regular hand sanitizer very offensive to me so this is a great alternative. I even had my significant other verify the smell to make sure my interpretation was accurate. The smell is very pleasant and reminds me of a peach jolly rancher. The spray bottle is super convenient and focused which I like. You don't have to worry about pressing the button and having it spray across the room.

The dispenser works really well, easy to push the button and the pick comes out reliably. The picks themselves are a bit underwhelming, though. They do the job, and haven't broken one yet, but the opening is 5/8-in and the thread is a bit thin. The thinner thread will dig in a bit more into the gums and the smaller opening may make it harder to use in larger mouths. The dispenser is made really to fit these specific picks, with very little clearance around the pick so you're probably not going to be able to fit other brands in the dispenser.", "...at least so far.\n\nThis dispenser keeps the flossers neatly stacked and ready to go; press the button and easy-peasy, out comes your flosser.\n\nWay better than digging in a bag and having several come out all connected together.\n\nFollow the directions and be sure to remove the \"protection plug\" first; (instructions on the box).\n\nAs the product page shows, there are also little \"take along\" cases which hold 10 or so flossers; of course you can refill them.\n\nThe flosser handles are a little on the smaller side, compared to some that I use, but I don't find them to be difficult to use.\n\nMy teeth are not tight, but neither are they loose; I find the actual floss works well and does not get stuck in between my teeth, but does the job it is supposed to do.\n\nThe pick at the end works well, as it should.\n\nThe handle itself is sturdy and does not bend inappropriately.\n\nThe arch of the plastic, the space between where the floss is and where the plastic top part of the flosser allows for a proper amount of travel down my teeth to the gum; I say that because some other brands I've ordered have too small a space in between. The plastic on those hits my teeth before the floss has gone all the way to the bottom.\n\nI don't have large or small teeth; just average.\n\nThe product page shows a video of how to refill the dispenser; kinda tedious.\n\nYou'll be manually dropping the flossers in, one by one.\n\nWhat would make this better is if the refill bag were configured to have the flossers held in a row to easily drop in (like a Pez dispenser-ish).\n\nIn any case, do it while watching a stupid movie that requires little focus.\n\nOtherwise, all around nice; dispenser, travel cases and of course, flossers.\n\nGlad I ordered.\n\nI hope this review has enabled you to make an informed purchase decision.\n\nI rarely give an overall 5 star rating.", "Dental floss picks work well, though they start to sag quickly after doing about half my teeth. Still, they are very convenient. The dispenser works great. I think regular floss around the fingers reaches more and does a better job, but these do fine", "I used to have the glide or those floss threads that dentists give out but I find those as a lot of waste with the threads. Why? When you pull out the floss thread, you have to pull enough to hold on both sides and you don\u2019t really use the ends you are holding onto. Then a lot of times they still break and you are left with two pieces that you have to replace. You also have to use both hands. A lot of waste.\n\nThis Floss pick is a terrific invention. You don\u2019t have to use both hands but instead only one hand while the other hand can pick up dirty dishes or put away clean dishes, or sweep the floor or feed the dog or do another thing than just flossing. You can multitask. It is also very strong in taking out stuck food particles in between teeth. It is a good prevention for plaque buildup. You can scrape the sides without hurting your gums. You are in control as to how hard or how soft to go with scraping. I don\u2019t think it will hurt the enamel. The disadvantage of using those flosses that glides is that it \u201cglides\u201d over the build up so it does nothing to clean it and is pointless in using it.\n\nThese are strong floss that doesn't easily break. However, there were some that you do one pull and they break. Maybe lemons amongst the limes. I expect them to be all in good shape but unfortunately not. Some have mint flavor and that is more enjoyable. This does not have any flavor or scent and that\u2019s ok.\n\nThe package came with 3 mini travel cases but no dispenser. That is ok with me since I put mine in a little glass jar with a cover so it does not dry out and works perfectly well. If you are convinced of my argument above ( and the title as well), I recommend this type of floss for your use.", "Great flossers and dispenser. Stores well and not an eyesore.", " You get 2 floss dispensers, each with 100 pieces of floss picks already inside. The dispensers work well. There is a small piece of plastic insert at the bottom of the dispenser that you would pull out first before pressing either of the buttons at the top to dispense a floss pick. I like this feature as it provides protection against accidentally pressing the buttons and dispensing floss picks. Once you pull out this piece, it\u2019s very easy to press either button and the floss picks come out quickly and easily. Then you can put this insert back in to \u201clock\u201d the dispenser. The floss is very thin, but still gets the job done. It stood up to my entire floss routine without breaking. The only issue with the dispenser is that it\u2019s difficult to open up the bottom, refill it with floss picks (you can purchase refill floss picks from the seller on Amazon right where you purchase these dispensers), then close the bottom again. See video. Overall, it\u2019s kind of a neat thing to dispense your floss picks this way, but I don\u2019t know how necessary it really is. I would still recommend it if you feel like you need a dispenser for your floss picks, just beware that it\u2019s not easy to refill, and you\u2019ll have to buy refill floss picks from the same seller to work with these dispensers.", "This ADENSYANG Dental Floss Picks - Floss Dispenser - Portable Storage Box Flossers for Adults - More Hygienic, Package Contains 2 Floss Dispenser Total 200pcs it's an overall pretty cool dispenser of 100 pieces each dispenser. It has a date on the clear dispenser for last month, I believe and hope that it is a manufactured date and not an expiration date. There are two buttons to dispense, one corresponding to each side of the dispenser. To open the dispenser is a little bit tricky, and I had to push the little clear plastic in order to open the lid, and there I saw the two different loading areas for the floss.

And, truth be told since the main thing a brush has to do is vibrate at a high frequency, it's not too hard to make an OK replacement for something like a Sonicare.\n\nThat said, a lot of these toothbrushes fall down by locking you into a non-standard head replacement ecosystem. The established head type is that defined by Sonicare, and some of these competitors can use head interchangeable with the Sonicare, but some can't. This one can't. As a result, once you've used these heads up, you'll be faced with the decision of whether you want to invest further in their ecosystem. (It's the razor model: Sell the kit cheaply, but the replacements can cost you).\n\nAnyway, in this kit you get:\n\n** **TWO** electric toothbrushes with 5 speeds -- one black, one pink\n** 5 matching brush heads per toothbrush\n** Two brush head caps (useful for travel or storage)\n** Two USB charging cables\n\nNote that these toothbrushes do not exactly match the pictures in the Amazon listing. In particular, they offer five speeds, vs the three in the pictures.\n\nThe toothbrushes do not (unfortunately) use a standard USB-C charge port. So don't lose the included charging cables. A full charge takes about 2 hours and is rated to last 30 days with 2 minutes of brushing each day. It should last longer than any business trip, which is good enough for me.\n\nThe toothbrushes support five modes (White/Clean/Sensitive/Polish/Massage). You cycle through the settings by pushing the power button repeatedly. I used Clean for my tests--and that's pretty similar to the speed of my entry-level Sonicare electric toothbrush.\n\nThe toothbrushes feel reasonably comfortable in my hand.\n\nAs noted, these brush heads are NOT interchangeable with standard Sonicare style heads. They use a very wide socket in the bottom of the brush head (which slips over the large white vibrating post at the top of the toothbrush--see photos). I worry that once these heads are used up, finding reasonable replacements at a reasonable cost may present an issue.\n\nTime will tell if this holds up to long-term use. But out of the box, it works fine.\n\nAssuming the price is reasonable, this would be an OK choice Given that you get five brush heads in the box per toothbrush (so 10 heads total) you could go quite a while before you needed to buy any new heads. But when you do, you'll have to decide if you want to spend money to be locked into an ecosystem or whether you just want to replace the entire thing.\n\nPros:\n** 10 brush heads included (5 per toothbrush) (should last at least a year per toothbrush)\n** Seems to work as well as lower-end Sonicare\n** Battery rated to run 30 days on a charge (not best in class, but long enough)\n** Inexpensive for a pack of two electric toothbrushes\n\nCons:\n** The brush heads connect via a non-standard interface and may be difficult/expensive to replenish\n** Doesn't use standard USB-C charge port", "This dual toothbrush is pretty neat. We haven't had it long but so far, so good. It is very light, so it's easy to hold. I like the small brush head because it makes it easy to get where I need to, especially since I have a small mouth. They leave me feeling so clean after every use: sleek design and three cleaning modes. I gave it 4 stars because there are a lot of splatters if you start the brush without smearing some of the toothpaste on your teeth before starting. And my hubby said; that this toothbrush's quality is only okay. But I like it so far, esp. the color. Battery life is also good. And the price seems reasonable. Thanks!", " I love sonic toothbrushes. I have a high-end Sonicare brush that I use daily and find that it is the perfect balance of power and high speed vibrations. But you would expect than in a $150 brush. How would pair of brushes that are bundled with 10 heads for under $30 compare? I was skeptical.\n\nBut after a day with these brushes, I am convinced that these are much better than their low price would indicate.\n\nPros:\n1- The high level of vibration (see my video) is comparable to my Sonicare. Wow! I used to use another brand for business travel, and this brush blew it out of the water with very good power and good mouthfeel.\n2) - The package makes no mention of ADA compliance, but this exact Fairywill model is listed in the ADA certification (see third photo). Seems like a big marketing oversight since not being listed is a big red flag. But the brush has been certified to be safe for your teeth and effective at cleaning them.\n3) The brushes charge quickly with their USB charging cable. I had mine up to full charge in about an hour and a half. I can't comment on the 30 days of runtime, but will check in later with an update.\n4) For $30 you get TWO brushes and 10 heads! That is insanely inexpensive pricing for such a good product.\n5) Everything about this product is nice, and I even liked the nice packaging (see photo 1). I would not be embarrassed to give this set as a gift.\n6) Most importantly, this thing can clean. With a little dab of toothpaste your mouth feels like it just came back from the dentist. I would say it is on par with my $150 Sonicare brush.\n\nCons:\n1) The biggest gripe I have with this brush is that the handles charge by sticking a USB cord into the bottom of the package (picture 2). Who has a USB plug in their bathroom? This is easily solved by taking a USB plug adaptor from an old cell phone.\n2) The brusheads are plentiful, they give you 10 total (5 black, 5 white, but they are clearly inferior to the Sonicare heads. Since cheap knock-off heads wear out much faster, I will simply replace them with Sonicare heads when they eventually wear away.\n3) There is no travel case for the brush, not a deal breaker, but I suppose some things have to be given up to hit a $30 price point.\n\nOverall, I am very impressed with the power and feel of the brush. I will report back on battery life and durability when I have had a chance to try them for a few months.\n\nCurrent grade: A+\n\n_____________\n\nFollow on review after a month of use - I just went to swap out the toothbrush heads to my favorite Sonicare plaque heads and found out that this unit is NOT compatible with Sonicare heads. This is a big problem for me, and while you can buy replacement heads for the Fairywill brush, you are forced to use them exclusively. I am deducting a star for the lack of interchangeability.", "2 sets of sonic toothbrushes. It comes with 5 replacement heads for a 18 month supply for each of the brushes!

I recently purchased a different brand (not one of the famous brands) and I thought it worked well although it didn't seem particularly powerful and the bristles on the brush heads were a bit softer than I would prefer. This two-pack costs considerably less than the single unit and is much better. It is easy to use as the different modes are clearly marked (not always the case, I have found). This also has more modes than mentioned in the product description (I guess the brand decided that the original statement that three were sufficient and \"no more modes needed\" wasn't right after all). The product description definitely needs to be updated. I have been using the pink version and the black one is for my husband. I like that these toothbrushes can be used in the shower, if desired. The unit charges quickly in about an hour and.half and it does last several weeks before needing to be re-charged. This feels much stronger and vibrates with a higher frequency than my other toothbrush. The brush heads are of medium firmness, so I feel I get a better clean. The heads are not the same as the name brand heads I have on hand or with those from a different no-name brand that I purchased a year or so ago. I do not see a recommended replacement option listed, either. Something to keep in mind for when it is time to replace them. I also wish that this set came with a case or pouch for each toothbrush. The current price of $34.99 seems very reasonable for two toothbrushes, each with 5 brush heads, each nicely packed in its own box.", "These toothbrushes do a great job at getting teeth to feel clean. I don't really notice a difference between using this or my sonicare in terms of how clean my teeth feel.\n\nThe battery lasts a long time, I have gone a few weeks on one charge easily.\n\nMy biggest issue is the thickness of the neck that the head is connected to. It feels too thick so it forces my lips open more than a normal toothbrush. Maybe it's just a weird sensory thing, but I can't get over it. I also hate how the charging port is at the bottom, who wants to lay their toothbrush down?", "If you are living in a two person household, this is the perfect sonic electric toothbrush set for you. Or maybe there's just one of you, but you have two bathrooms. This way, you can place one in each room for easier access.\n\nThese are fairly good sonic toothbrushes. They are powerful and offer a nice strong vibration if that's the mode you select. All modes are good, but you will find your favorites as you use these.\n\nWorks great to keep your teeth clean and healthy. Feel fine in the mouth.\n\nThere are only two things that I don't like. One is that it does not include a charger. You'll need to provide your own. They are fairly versatile, so hopefully you already have one for some other device in your home, such as a cell phone. There are two charging cables included though. The other is that brush heads can sometimes be difficult to track down. What's provided should last you though for a good while.", "Seems like a decent starter set of sonic style teethbrushes (unless you only have one tooth), for just a bit more than $30 incl. tax.\nThe feel of the teethbrushes is very similar to that of my Sonicare brush, and maybe just a but faster on the vibe thingie.\nThe toothbrushes do come with a total of 10 heads, which is good since the brush heads from my Sonicare don't fit these toothbrushes. Could be a problem, maybe not.\n\nAs of this the time this review is being written, I have not gotten an answer to whether or not more brush heads are available.\n\nWould it be economically realistic to just buy another full set when the brush heads are worn out? Maybe, but I don't choose to go that route. Loss of one star for the company not making clear if more brush heads can be purchased.\n\nBottom Line: These work well enough, charge fast and so far the charge has lasted several days with no discernible reduction in speed. The price is very attractive also.", "the battery life does last four weeks with 2x per day brushing.\n\nThis is a great value in sonic style toothbrushes at $17 per toothbrush that includes 7 brush heads for each brush. Altho\u2019 the handles are the same, save the color, the brush heads are different. The pink are soft and the black are a combination of bristle types and strengths. I don\u2019t know the technology or technical terms but they are too strong for my sensitive gums; the pink are fine. If you need to reorder brush heads, they are available on Amazon by searching: DUPONT REPLACEMENT TOOTHBRUSH HEADS\n\nIf you\u2019re new to sonic electric toothbrushes, go slowly. It will feel like nothing is happening when in fact this brush is moving at 40K vibrations per minute. FYI, that\u2019s fast and a lot of movement against your gums, cheeks or tongue and you can do damage. The brush has a built in program and timer that will signal every 30 seconds for 2 minutes and then shut off. That\u2019s 4 timed sessions, 4 quadrants of your mouth and done. Trust the brush!\n\nCharging time is 90-120 minutes depending on your equipment and the battery lasts 4 weeks with twice daily brushing at 4 total minutes. The manufacturer provides a short USB cord for each toothbrush but you can use any standard cord.\n\nAll things considered, an excellent choice in sonic toothbrushes, shipped ready for gifting\u2728", "My sonicares finally wore out. New ones too expensive. Tried these and they work fine. Comes with message tip and extra heads. Battery lasts, several settings. Highly recommend. Great toothbrush!

I got this to take when traveling. It's compact and doesn't take up a lot of room. It can be used by two people because it comes with two units and numerous extra heads. It charges up quickly. Seems to last quite awhile. I haven't actually made note of how long the charge lasted. It's lasted the entire trip every time I've used it. So that wasn't an issue for me. Does a great job of cleaning too. It has a timer but I don't use it.", "These have been a wonderful set of toothbrushes. We had been considering getting some sort of electronic/sonic tooth brushes for a while but had waffled on brand, expense, etc... These may not be top line name brand, but they have been great little sonic toothbrushes. I feel like my teeth are cleaner then usual. They have a little gap in the vibrations every 30 seconds so you have a better idea of how long you are brushing which helps a lot. We are just a few weeks in, but the charge is holding nicely.

These electric toothbrushes work great, just charge them up and start brushing. They are really very powerful. They make your teeth feel as clean as if done professionally at the dentist. They really thought of everything with this set because it comes with replacement brushes too. Definitely recommend!", "This packaging states \"Fairywill\" and model E11 Dual Pack. I find this brand is common among the resellers. Comes with 2 toothbrushes; dark blue and pink. The product advertised as having 3 modes. In reality. each of these supports 5 modes of operation; white, clean, sensitive, polish and massage. After finding the right mode, I just stick to that mode. The toothbrush bristles are of good quality. Typically each toothbrush head can last about 3 months. So far I have no idea where to buy the toothbrush head replacements when the time comes. Therefore having 5 toothbrush head per set; 10 toothbrush head for the 2 sets, helps to ensure this can be used over 1.5 years per set. Easy to put and remove the toothbrush head. Easy to operate and charge as well. Uses a 2 min duration with 4 sessions of 30 sec each. With this timer, it helps to make sure I spent enough time brushing my teeth. Over time, I do feel find my teeth much cleaner than using a manual toothbrush.

I think it is worth a bit of struggle for them because these toothbrushes are very effective at cleaning teeth. The charge seems to last a long time.

I love that they both come with multiple matching heads and their own charging cables. They're a good size - larger than the travel-size electric one I'd been using, and less clunky than my husband's old one. They're lightweight and not too cumbersome to use. Super strong, dentist-level vibration. I like that each setting is labeled (all are explained in detail in the instructions), and it's easy to tell by the vibration pattern when it's time to switch positions. The one tiny complaint I have is that the black toothbrush has rose gold accents instead of silver - which is not a very masculine look - but actually, I doubt my husband will ever notice.

No sight of dandruff reoccurrence so far.\n\nThis comes in a clear plastic bottle with a disc dispenser cap. it is fully shrink-wrapped for protection. No leaks. Made in Canada. Overall, it works well as a shampoo, and leaves my hair soft and clean. It tames the itch on the scalp and seems to help with dandruff as well. I like it. So far so good.", "The shampoo is fine as far as getting hair clean, but I feel like my scalp feels dry (maybe even itchy) after using this. The salicylic acid is there to clean/exfoliate pores and while I'm a long way from being an expert, I didn't think that's what caused dandruff. Regardless, after using this a few times, I haven't really noticed any less dandruff.\n\nEveryone is different, and maybe this works for others...but for me, I'll try alternatives.", "I normally don't have dandruff, but I was dealing with that issue after switching to a type of hair gel that seemed to cause some kind of allergic reaction. After using this shampoo for two weeks, the issue is completely gone. Even though the bottle is kind of small, it still lasts quite a while since you only need about a dime sized amount in your hand.", "Having dandruff is no fun, but you shouldn't have to put up with it! Using dandruff shampoo is a must, so I'm always looking for new kinds to try out. Its also great if you have scalp acne, because of the salicylic acid", "My only complaint about True+Real Salicylic Acid Anti-Dandruff Shampoo 3% Salicylic Acid, 4.4 Fl Oz is that I wish it were a bigger bottle. The price point for the size is something to consider. However, I am happy with its performance. It works well on my periodic dandruff. It is gentle on my scalp and hair. My hair feels clean and light. My scalp doesn't feel dry. It doesn't lather up as much as my usual shampoo but it gets the job done.", "This is a good product it doesn\u2019t have heavy fragrance or anything irritating and it\u2019s a chemical exfoliants great for skin buildup dry skin etc. but this is such a small bottle", "I\u2019m always looking for a good dandruff shampoo and so far this has helped me with my problem. It\u2019s does provide itching relief instantly and leave my hair clean and fresh.", "Photo 1: care they take in shipping package\nPhoto 2: my weekly brush out of dandruff\nPhoto 3: 2wks after using this product. 3days after most recent wash\n\nBeing a lupus patient and on 20 different medications my skin is so dry so flaky and nothing like it used to be. My scalp needed help as someone with naturally dark thick Italian dark, you could see EVERY flake. My pillow case would need a vacuum. Guys it's gross.\n\nThen I came across this product and thought to myself \"f it why not\" really didn't think much of it. Until I used it. After a couple weeks of use 3 times a week. I'm crying... photos tell the story I hope", "True+Real Salicylic Acid Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is a must have shampoo if you have dandruff or flaking issues. I love this stuff and it really helps.\n\nThe lather and everything is just like other shampoos, washes out cleanly. Just make sure you get this worked into your scalp really well. I use this once a week, sometimes more if the situation needs it.", "I have chronic issues with my scalp and this shampoo really helps with the flaking and itching. It doesn\u2019t have a strong, odd smell like some of the shampoos. The scent is very mild. I\u2019m so happy I found this product.", "Great shampoo. I'm sensitive to fragrance and I like that this is a fragrance free option.\n\nMy hair is curly and it did tend to strip it a bit, so make sure if your hair tends towards dry you use a good conditioner afterwards.", "Not all dandruff shampoo smells pleasant. This T-Plus has almost no scent at all which is my preference. It calms psoriasis (of which there is no cure) better than the leading brand (Seltzen Blue) and has 3 times the active ingredients.\nI recommend working it into your scalp with a little water ten to fifteen minutes before showering. Let it sit there doing its job. Leaves hair nice.\nIt also helps to calm rosacea. Just apply it when you soak your hair.\nWarning: Salicylic Acid can make your hair fall out. It may or may not be temporary. Don't overuse it. One or two uses a week is enough.\n\nRecommended", "The True+Real Salicylic Acid Anti-Dandruff Shampoo is a pleasant yellow-color scalp shampoo. It uses Salicylic Acid as its active ingredient instead of the usual pyrithione zinc that is found in many anti-dandruff shampoos. I have found that Salicylic Acid, an aspirin relative, provides a gentle remedy for skin issues.\n\nThe yellow shampoo liquid lathers well. It cleaned my hair and left it smooth and shiny, without the necessity of a conditioner. The 4.4 ounces may seem like a small amount, but it will last a while since I plan on using this shampoo once a week."]}, {"link": "https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B83ZNGC1", "title": "Downy RINSE & REFRESH Laundry Odor Remover and Fabric Softener, Fresh Lavender, 48 fl oz, Safe on ALL Fabrics, Gentle on Skin, HE Compatible", "price": "10 options from\n$14.98", "img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71466G5nX-L._AC_SY606_.jpg", "ratings": "421 ratings", "description": "Tired of stubborn odors that never seem to wash out of your clothes?

The smells last awhile and keeps the house and towels smelling fresh.", "It is a very light scent from the bottle, after washing & drying we couldn't determine a light fresh scent.

I love how long it lasts.", "I tried this product, and while I do not dislike the scent, it doesn\u2019t smell like lavender. Maybe \u201cwhite lavender\u201d is a different thing, it\u2019s possible that it\u2019s just something different that I wasn\u2019t aware of. I was hoping for lavender. It does do as advertised though and make your clothes have a smell that is pleasant and long-lasting. I wish I could purchase a sampler of like a teaspoon of each of a variety of different scents so that I could find one that I like since it is not entirely clear from the scent name.", "Using a small amount of these beads is just enough scent not to be overwhelming.", "Great Light scent lasts for weeks on everything just in love .", "Nice and light.
